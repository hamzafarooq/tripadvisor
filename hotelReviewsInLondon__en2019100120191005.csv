1,"Had a fantastic 2 night stay here in Travelodge London City. It is all new, modern decor, with plenty of space in the cafe and breakfast area. Great little bar too. Our rooms were clean with comfy beds, kettle and tea/coffee, fluffy towels.Location is great - hop on the bus outside on St Bolstoph Street, or just head to London Tower on foot (where you can then hop onto a river boat if you want the scenic route down to Westminster!). Liverpool Street train station is only 5/10 minute walk away too, where the Stansted Express can take you to Stanstead Airport in less than an hour. Aldgate tube station and bus station are also just around the corner, so it really is a good base for visiting lots of London.On Sunday, the Petticoat Lane market is less than a minute away and Spitalfields market only a 5 minute walk from there. Would definitely recommend the latter, we spent well over an hour there and made some great purchases!Loved our stay here and will definitely return.

2,"I was hoping for a good experience from the reviews but this is the best Travelodge I have stayed at. Minutes from Aldgate Tube and in a quiet traffic free street (amazing for London). Rooms were clean and functional with a great aircon system and very quiet with lots of sockets etc. Only tiny negative was the layout of the bathroom was tight between toilet and sink but a minor issue. Nice airy bar and restaurant area and the food, although pre-prepared was hot, tasty and served with a smile and there were plenty of staff on hand. That brings me to the final point. the staff were smiley, welcoming and helpful from the time I checked in until I left after breakfast. A good breakfast at that. Cant single any out but I stayed on the night of 10 July and they were all great. It isnt always that way. Would I stay again- yes my hotel of choice when in London on my works budget","July 11, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

5,"Generally a good hotel facility. Neat and clean room. No in-room phone. A bit of a distance to get into the London City Centre (Trafalgar Square, Covent Gardens. Used Uber for the first time for local transportation. Liked the nearby restaurant. Not far to pubs in the area. One simple dinner in the hotel restaurant was fine. Stayed a total of four nights. My only reservation would be the proximity to the City ""hub"", but otherwise reasonably priced. Stayed as a solo traveler.","July 10, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

Being told that they are fully booked without checking booking information on the computer.... the manager was equally unhelpful as the front desk staff. manager just came and repeated the same story of being fully booked without checking any booking information ... never staying in Travelodge again...completely spoilt the visit/stay.","July 9, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

11,"This is a new(ish) Travelodge located near the financial part of London, and very near the Aldgate and Aldgate East tube stations. It is what you would expect from a Travelodge hotel, clean, a bit basic, but perfectly adequate. I stayed with nights and was more than happy with my room. It was a cosy room and while fine for a couple, it might feel a bit cramped after a while. Some points to note: while there is basic coffee/tea making facilities, there is no fridge so nowhere to store food. This means you pretty much need to eat out. Secondly, there are no laundry facilities so you will probably need to use a local laundromat/laundry or dry cleaner. There is also no safe deposit facility in the room but that isn’t an issue these days with card-only access to rooms.I liked that you had to explicitly say you wanted your room serviced by leaving a sign on your door. If you don’t, then your room isn’t serviced.There is a local restaurant where I had breakfast most days. Pretty cafeteria-like, and there are nicer places around to have breakfast to be honest.There is paid-Wifi for more than 30 minutes. Only two devices though are allowed on the same paid access.I booked well in advance and got a good price - about GBP120 a night from memory, which is great by London standards.Near to two tube stations so very handy. Takes about 20 minutes to get into say Oxford Street.You don’t stay in a Travelodge for style, but this is a very comfortable place to stay for a reasonable price near major transport routes.","July 9, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

12,"In the heart of London’s east end, a couple of Underground stops from city centre with 2 underground stations on the doorstep of the hotel, great place to stay if you fancy a curry at the famous Brick Lane","July 9, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

13,"We stayed at London City Travelodge for one night during a recent trip to London. The room was very clean and tidy, and was perfectly suitable for a short sight-seeing trip.We have previously stayed at the Travelodge in Covent Garden. To compare the two, we would choose the London City branch for future visits. Although the room and bathroom were smaller, the main advantage is that we were able to store our luggage before check-in and after check-out, which we weren't able to do at Covent Garden and was a huge inconvenience. The London City hotel is very close to Aldgate tube station, so it's easy enough to get around and is in a nice, quiet area.The cons of this hotel are that there is not a lot of storage space (which was fine for us, as we were only staying one night), but there is no wardrobe - just a few hangers on a rail. The bathroom is also small and basic-looking, and the breakfast price is far too high, but it's easy enough to head over to the nearby Pret-a-Manger or EAT instead.For a cheaper hotel for a short break, we'd recommend. Comfy, clean and easily accessible. ","July 8, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

14,"Very good value hotel Clean and modern rooms. Friendly staff on reception. Quick and easy check in. We didn’t use The bar area or restaurant as we went out ... but it looked busy and seemed very good value from the offers on show. We asked staff for more towels and were given them straight away. No problems. Aldgate East tube station is about a two-five minute walk away from the hotel, depending on what entrance you use... I think there’s at least 3 entrances to the station! The only thing that could be improved is maybe providing a bath mat or a smaller towel for people to stand on when they get out the shower. Also there is no mirror in front of the dressing table. Only very small issues and nothing major ....I Would definitely stay again if the price stays at a reasonable rate. ","July 7, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

London sometimes has a reputation for rudeness but this was certainly not the case in my experience at this Travel Lodge; reception, security, bar, kitchen, waiting staff were ALL lovely. The hotel itself was scrupulously clean, as was my room which was so welcome after a particularly unpleasant trip up to London. The toilet and shower were almost sterile looking - and no hairs left in the plug holes!!

23,The double room is not big but it's expected for a hotel in London. The big star for this hotel (in my opinion) is its location. Just 2 minutes away from Aldgate station and 5 minutes from Aldgate East station by foot. It's a 10 minute walk to Liverpool Street station which isn't bad at all either. Spitalfields and Brick Lane markets are not far away from the hotel. I took a 30 minute walk to Columbia Road Flower Market on Sunday morning - certainly helped to have lovely weather for that. I would come back to this hotel on my next visit to London. ,"July 1, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

47,"Somehow, I managed to get a Friday night, super room here for £62 which is astonishingly cheap for Central London so my expectations were not high! However, I was so pleasantly surprised! Staff were friendly and helpful, although small, the room was spotlessly clean and well equipped and it was exceptionally quiet. A couple of minutes walk from the Tube at Aldgate and not too far to stroll up to Spitalfields market and beyond into Hoxton so plenty of places to eat, drink and shop nearby.We didn’t sample the restaurant at all but it looked new and nicely done. Highly recommended if you can get a good weekend deal. ","June 15, 2019","0    Travelodge London City hotel

48,"My husband and I were in London with my brother and father to celebrate my dads 80th birthday. We had lost our mom the previous fall and this trip was to reconnect with relatives and some of my dads old friends from the UK. From the time we arrived our experience was top notch. The room my husband and I had was the super saver and was small as expected but we asked if anything was available a bit larger and they gave us an accessible room which is much larger. The room was spotless and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The location could not be any better as it is a 2 minute walk from two different tube stations. There are also plenty of dining options within a 5 minute walk.My dad and brother were meeting us 2 days after us so after telling the host at the front desk our story she offered to decorate their room upon their arrival! I hope I am giving her the credit she deserves as I thought her name was Yasmet but the card she gave me said Sultana, perhaps this is her last name. Also Bagi who was the head of housekeeping helped and the result was incredible. They had specifically purchased 80’s decorations with confetti, balloons and banners and a nice bottle of wine with glasses for their arrival. Talk about 5 star service!We cannot express our thanks enough and highly recommend this hotel. Obviously the service surpassed any expectations but it is also a fantastic value for the rate.

55,"The hotel is not really supposed to be walked to - which I find odd in London. It's a rather long walk from the train station that's a bit tricky and not straigh forward. It feels like you're in the middle of nowhere, but then again, the name Docklands doesn't usually conjure up pictures of downtown.The staff is very friendly and welcoming, the rooms are roomy and clean. Don't call the front desk for power and/or towels: the power only works with the key in the slot next to the light switch and the 2. person's towels are in the closet (for whatever reason).Breakfast is included but a mess. They offer everything you'd want to eat and more, but it's presented in such a small space that you have to fight your way through, wait about a 30 minutes for a waffle and if you ever leave your seat, be prepared to lose it in the time it takes you to get another cup of coffee. The most disorganized hotel breakfast I've ever seen.There's a Chinese restaurant and a pub nearby, and the hotel's pub offers some snacks as well.","July 12, 2019","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

57,"We eventually arrived at the hotel having been given completely wrong directions from central reservations and landed up in not one, but two different Hilton hotels before we reached the correct one. We were fortunately given a free taxi ride, with a little bit of persuasion, from the first wrong hotel as I dread to think how much the fare would have been - probably about £50.The room was clean and the beds very comfortable - nice and hard! The bathroom was good with a very powerful shower but it would have been nice to have somewhere to hang wet towels as had to ask for fresh ones every day as soaking wet.Breakfast was included in the price and very tasty.Not quite so good re lunch. Only snacks available. On the last day I ordered a baked potato which had black bits inside. I asked a member of staff for another one but she came back a few minutes later to tell me all the potatoes were in the same condition. She then asked me what I would like to replace suggesting I had a pizza but I wasn’t prepared to pay the extra price. I opted for a panini with cheese and bacon inside with salad but it wasn’t very appetising. The hotel was well situated opposite London City Airport and about a 3 minute walk from the DLR which made travelling into the City very easy.On my return home I realised I had left my hot water bottle behind which I need for pain relief. I have emailed twice but have had no reply to either emails. Not good.Not sure if I would stay there again.","July 3, 2019","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

58,"My wife and I are currently heading home on the train after a 4 night stay and we were both chatting about how great a stay we had.The hotel itself is almost new so very clean throughout with little to no signed of wear and tear.It’s a few minutes walk from the Prince Albert DLR station so access to the tube network is a real doddle. Trips to and from the city centre take ball park 40 minutes using the tube and other public transport.The hotel is also very close to London airport, this is not an issue at all as at no time could we hear the planes as they landed and departed, the same applies to the DLR. We found our room especially quiet and as a light sleeper this was a god send (floor 7 room 723).The hotels real strong point was the staff, they really are a credit to the hotel and the Hampton brand, we received a friendly greeting upon arrival and this continued throughout our stay wether at reception, the bar or when crossing paths with the cleaning team! Sincerely I think you would struggle to find better staff elsewhere!!!The only slight negative for us was breakfast, it was very manic so we would grab a quick coffee and dash rather than face the scrum but again the hotel only cost us £84 a night so an overly busy breakfast area doesn’t change the fact that this really is a great hotel for the price and somewhere we will actively look to book next time we are in London.","July 1, 2019","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

Food was good in the hotel, including breakfast. Staff were very nice. Only issue was the fact that I’d asked for a late check out (up to 2pm) and around 11:30am, housekeeping was already knocking on the door, and did so about 3 times before we left (around 12:15pm).

It would have been nice to have fried rather than scrambled eggs though.

88,"Stayed here on a number of occasions. It is very hand for LCY airport and indeed for the ExCel Conference facilities. Rooms are simple, clean and beds are comfortable. I choose a high corner room as you get a view of the airport and up the river too. Breakfast was sufficient for my needs, wifi was a simple click to get on instead of trying to get a password etc, and staff were friendly and willing to help.My digital room key half worked - It opened the floor door but not my bedroom door, so only snag of the stay.Visited the Chinese 100 yards away and had a very good meal.I've returned a few times and even taken my family there too as was convenient for the Emirates sky cable car and easy to get into/out of London and lower cost of being in town.","March 14, 2019","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

It’s very well equipped and includes a decent breakfast buffet. Very good value for money. If you’re using City Airport or visiting the Excel it’s ideally located. Staff were really friendly and attentive. The beds in the room were super comfortable. Room and bathroom is well equipped. Will definitely be back.

93,"For Central London, to have great quality at this price (my last minute booking for a queen room was around 90 pounds) is outstanding. The Hotel is recently refurbished to a very high standard. The doors are heavy, so the soundproofing is excellent. The linen was fresh and clean and extremely comfortable. Wi Fi is free and the staff are very well-trained and helpful. The free breakfast buffet was good with thick bacon and lovely sausages. The only very minor downsides were that the only prepared fruit at breakfast were those horrible canned mandarin segments, and the rooms were slightly on the small side. But all-in-all this place is outstanding value and comfort and I am definitely going again.","February 21, 2019","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

96,"First of all, the location - this hotel is in a great location for London City Airport and the Excel, O2 Arena, or even Canary Wharf etc. DLR is approx 5 minute walk away for transport into London. Note the DLR from City Airport is a different line, so you need to walk (5-10 mins) or get a cab.Breakfast, complimentary buffet style breakfast. A good selection, fresh and plentiful, layout a bit odd and bit of a free-for-all, but good nonetheless. Unfortunately, that's about it for positive comments.There is no restaurant at this hotel, they offer bar snacks, but you will need to go further afield for 'proper' food. I asked if they had any sort of deals / link-up with the DoubleTree (another Hilton brand) across the road, and got a 'no of course not' sort of response.The free Wifi was very slow and pretty much unusable. Didn't test the premium Wifi. Reception advised the signal isn't great in some areas, but was able to use the business centre computers instead.The bed was pretty firm, yet the pillows far too soft, so you just sank into them. Mattress slipped away from headboard if you tried to sit up in bed, to read etc. Duvet cover was torn, and towels were worn and freyed.The room was clean and neatly presented, though the shower tray in the bathroom was worn and looked grubby/dirty. Otherwise the bathroom was also clean and tidy.Air-conditioning was a nightmare. It was set to 29 degrees (C) on arrival, and the room was very warm. We turned it down to 20 (a reasonably comfortable temperature) and it just started blasting out cold air, eventually we switched it off when the room had cooled down. However we were woken in the middle of the night sweltering hot as it had reset itself back to 29 degrees and the room was like an oven. Again, we turned it down and it blasted out cold air until we switched it off. This happened each night we were there.I raised the issue of the aircon with reception, didn't really get an apology, just excuses such as it must have 'got stuck' on a previous guests settings and that they would reset it. This did not resolve the issue, and nobody bothered to actually check with us if it had or not.Advised reception again about it the following morning, was advised maintenance would look at it the following day!Overall, we had 3 nights of broken sleep in what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend away. This felt like a stay at a poor budget hotel, I expected much more from a Hilton branded property.","February 17, 2019","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

98,"I stayed here with my partner for one night on a Saturday as we were seeing a show at the O2 arena. We paid £84 through booking.com which was very good value.This hotel is in a really clean, quiet and safe area opposite London City Airport and is just a few mins walk from the Royal Albert DLR station. We had a queen room which was really clean and tidy, although the net curtain was a bit dirty but this is just a small gripe. There is heating/air con, big shower, huge tv, desk, hairdryer, tea/coffee and all the other stuff you’d expect.The breakfast was really good with lots of choice. They don’t offer room service meals but they have a 24/7 hot snacks service you can order at the bar - the wait for this was quite long but the food was tasty enough for a simple panini. They also do pizza, nachos etc.I’d definitely stay here again for the O2 as it’s really easy to get there from the hotel, and the price was excellent.

100,"Friday night stay.€88.Arrived into London City airport - short 5 minute walk across the Thames to this absolute GEM of a hotel.Extremely fast check-in by some of the most friendly and professional staff I've ever encountered.Room was huge, with very comfortable King Sized Bed.Large Flatscreen TV with excellent selection of channels.Spotless WC with power shower.Basic toiletries supplied - perfect!I was starving when I arrived, so I ordered a pizza from the kitchen (they don't do room service - you have to collect your order from the bar downstairs)Couldn't believe how quickly the delicious pizza was cooked and ready for collection.Washed it down with a nice pint of IPA Slept like a log in a really comfortable bed with plenty of pillows. Can't believe how comfortable it was - seriously!Up for breakfast next morning. It's a buffet style affair, but there's plenty of hot food and cold options available.So...that's all the good things.Now, the downside.......Hold on a minute - there's NO downside.This place is perfect.Its part of the Hilton Chain and, I'm guessing aimed at families, but don't let any part of that put you off.This establishment is truly tremendous....and not just the accommodation and facilities.It's always nice to see smiling staff who are attentive to a customers needs. it's a huge 10/10 from me Great work.....see you again soon!","January 16, 2019","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

103,"Overall, this hotel will do. It's a far ride to the city, about 40 min to central London but the subway isn't hard to use and there's a DLR stop close by. The breakfast is also acceptable as the eggs are those premade powdered kind and tasted pretty gross, but it was free. What I would say is that I didn't see any of the staff smile or seem to be friendly the entire 5 days we were here. They weren't rude, but they weren't especially nice either. We had a small issue with our cards not working on our last night and the manager came out to help and explain that I only booked for 4 days, almost to the point of blaming me for the issue with the cards but not quite. When I showed him my confirmation for 5, he just dismissed the whole thing without further comment and we recieved our cards back, now working. We weren't wished a nice evening, no apology for the inconvenience, no smile. Not a requirement at a hotel in my opinion, but still. I don't ask for much from a hotel, hardly ever drink the free waters or use the coffee pots, and never in my life have I ordered room service but this trip I had a bit of a cold and looked for some of those extra things that make a hotel stay more comfortable. There is no water or ice machine, have to buy water downstairs. There is no fridge in the room. There is no room service. I asked on our last night to use a microwave to warm dinner brought back to the hotel, as we got back early to prepare for an early departure the next day (also knowing there's no room service) , and of course there isn't one for guests. Outside of the lack of hospitality, the walls are very thin and I had to go myself to our next door neighbors, who were in town for a basketball tournament, to ask them to quiet down at around 12am. Stay here if this is a great deal, but I'd recommend looking around and paying a few extra dollars to be closer to the city. ","December 30, 2018","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

105,"I was invited to this place by management after not being able to get food at their sister hotel across the road.reception staff fairly warm and welcoming bar one or two who choose to be a little distant and snooty.Hotel looks nice and the foyer area is very well comfortable. I like the decor and the ambiance of the place, its a well set up operation and I find few foibles bar the fact they jack the prices up during comic con expo week to levels that are near extortionate the two times per year the expo takes place.Why should we be subsiding airport flight cancellation stopovers which is these hotels meat and veg. I remind Hampton owners that a lot of people who go to comic con are disabled and cannot afford much.The breakfast at £10 is to scream for totally marvellous value for money against the others. Hot and cold buffet breakfast with a waffle maker and toppings galore.My only critique no decaffeinated coffee in the electronic dispenser hot drinks machine, that is a very big no no.This article would have been 4 stars if for one thing? The member of breakfast staff going around shouting and pushing their weight about with the customers and by the way when you let your family in i.e. husband and children to eat food with the customers (presumable they haven't paid) one suggests you keep a low profile and try to cease throwing the proverbial doll out of the pram. It isn't a perk of the job when its affecting resident paying customers and this member of staff stuck out like a sore thumb it was so blatantly obvious.You let yourself down Hampton on one small straw issue that broke the camels back.The management need to get a grip quite fast as you're having the jest taken out of you.This article is my own personal opinion and perception based on two meal visits over two days there a paying customer in a party of 5 at £100 in total.","December 27, 2018","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

106,Stayed here for business. Chose a flexible booking but told that only counted upto the day I booked. Quite disappointing but it was on the booking form. Very limited menu in the 'restaurant' that's mostly Iceland frozen specials by the look of it.Room OK but cold when getting back from work. Keep finding hairs in the shower and on the carpet that aren't mine but that's just par for the course in UK hotels I did have an extra card but that was taken by the cleaners on the first day. There are other options that are available in the vicinity that do the same thing but better. Found most of the staff to be friendly and helpful but not all. Won't be going back if I can help it.OK for London if you are paying 'discounted' price but certainly not worth the usual rates.,"December 19, 2018","1    Hampton by Hilton London Docklands

Waiters were very pleasant and attentive.The foyer and beautiful staircase up to the Lands End restaurant were immaculate.The restaurant itself again was immaculate, beautiful white linen.Great place to enjoy tea or whatever.

116,"Me and my husband £570 to stay here for 2 nights on wednesday 26th june for our 1st yrs wedding anniversary, upon arrival we were told that we still had 5mins untill check in so we went to the bar, the barman told us to take a seat as it was table service, after waiting 15mins i decided to collect my drink myself only to be told they didnt have my husbands drink and we was to choose something else, overall it took about 30mins to be served even though there were only 6 people in the bar at the time.The drinke were ridiculously overpriced with an added service charge. When trying to check in AGAIN we were greeted by a miserable,rude young lady called Ilona who then informed us that as we didnt have the card we had booked and paid on (altough payment was made days prior and booking confirmed) we wasnt allowed to stay and there was nothing she can do! she needed that exact card! so if you have been bought this trip as a gift im assuming you will need to bring the payees card with you?? on booking this there was nothing to say that bringing that card was complusary. Luckly enough for us we only lived the other side of the water so was able to get a black taxi home to collect the card which cost us £50! cant imagine how anyone travelling from afar would be able to do or afford to do this. eventually 2hours later we eventually checked into our room, after walking down the hallway with the worn out rippled carpet that tripped me over our bathroom had hair all over the floor. The balcony with sea view that we paid extra for was tiny i could just about cross my legs without grazing my knees, with 2 cheap garden furniture chairs to sit on, and when u did u couldnt see the sea only the sky as the chairs were low down. Its so close to the city airport, at first watching a plane go past so close was amazing untill we realised it was every 5 mins and was so loud you had to stop conversation untill the plane had past, this was from morning untill late.EVERY 5 MINUTES!! The room was big but not luxury, the cleaner left our dirty coffee cups and spoons after making up our room and left our room with 1 tea bag. Breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about, cheap bacon, had plenty of breakfasts like this in alot cheaper accommodation, wasnt worth the upgrade! Toilets in bar and reception were clean but the only time the sink water worked was when you turn on the bidet hose in the cubicle?? Some Staff were rude, some had very strong accents and were hard to understand, The only thing thats luxury about this Yacht is the stair case, it was beautiful,gives you the impression on arrival that you are stepping into a luxury, classy hotel but the rest of this hotel is standard and feel we wasted our money. The website for Sunborn is terrible, only promoting the spa and wont allow you to do anything direct with them, i didnt get to use the spa as you have to book via reception who had no clue as to prices and info etc, i was told that reception would call them and the spa would call me back at somepoint, when they did i was told the therapist had been working and was tired and could only see me at 9am the morning i was leaving. When checking out i was asked how my stay was, i explained that i was far from happy and the duty manager refunded our breakfast cost and our overpriced bar bill for 2 drinks which we waited ages for and got something compleatly different anyway which altogether came to £78...£50 of which wouldve covered our taxi bill home to collect our bank card, so to be honest wasnt much compensation for all the inconveniance we had! I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone unless you have money to burn and are not expecting to much in return.","July 1, 2019","2    Sunborn London

I had to wait to be let in the fire exit.i think this should be explained on booking. On booking I was told my card would be held the amount 48 prior and payment could be made on the day. They took the payment in full instead 48 hours before, even though I explained at the time of booking I had a £200 gift voucher to use. I now have to wait 3-5 days for a refund back to my card. In the Bar we waited 25 minutes for chips, asked for mayo and was given empty used jars from another table by the waiter. Service in restaurant was poor, waited 20 minutes for them to take our dinner plates. Explained at check out when asked if we had a good stay, receptionist not interested. Bar and restaurant add 12.5% discretionary tip to everything. How they can justify that with such poor service is beyond me. Not worth the money at all.","June 30, 2019","2    Sunborn London

118,"After booking this hotel for my Parents for a Christmas present, and for an engagement gift for my sister, we decided to go and stay ourselves after recently having a baby. I tried to book direct on the sunborn website however a box kept coming up for me to enter a draw for a spa break (sunborn promotion not a random advert) despite continually clicking continue browsing it kept coming up. I decided to then book via Expedia. Later on that evening I looked at the hotel for things to do on my iPad (the contine browsing worked this time) and I noticed you get benefits for booking direct, such as 10% of food bill, and upgrades if available. I emailed sunborn and advised I booked via Expedia (it was £3 cheaper despite sunborn promoting they offer the cheapest rates). I explained my issue, and that this was a treat & asked whether they could honour the loyalties or would I need to cancel and rebook. The response back, “no we are unable to honour this & as you booked a non refundable rate with Expedia you won’t be able to cancel”. I found this so frustrating as we were going to eat onboard, but knowing I could’ve saved left a bitter taste in our mouths! I mean I only saved £3 by booking elsewhere & did contact immediately to explain! I have spent over £700 with sunborn this year! The hotel is lovely & the staff are very friendly but due to the poor service on my booking this will be the last time.","June 28, 2019","2    Sunborn London

The queen sized bed was very comfortable and the nautically themed decor was aesthetically tasteful. As our room was below deck, the only reminder of being on water once actually on board was looking at the river view from the restaurant. The staff were helpful to the nth degree and nothing was too much trouble.The breakfast was absolutely delicious and you could eat your fill.My only bugging issue was the key card that is also supposed to operate the lift. It was very temperamental; in the 2/3 days we were there we had to get it re-programmed 3 times this was somewhat inconvenient. Other than that we enjoyed our stay very much.

125,"Some months back I booked this hotel as a birthday treat for myself. I read the reviews before booking & they were mostly positive, but the closer to our stay there were a few more negative ones & I did begin to wonder whether I would be disappointed. I needn't have worried, I can honestly say we had a fabulous stay & did not have any of the problems others have posted about, such as noise & poor customer service. Check in was quick & simple, the young woman on reception was very welcoming & efficient, in fact every member of staff we encountered was friendly & helpful.We stayed in an Executive King Room with river view. The room was spacious & spotlessly clean, with a small balcony, sadly we didn't get to use the balcony as much as I would have liked because of the awful weather but the main thing the room was so quiet & peaceful.We did not eat breakfast on the boat, as I felt £20 a head was rather a lot in view of the fact I need gluten free food & probably would not be able to eat much of what was on offer. We did however eat dinner on board on the night of my birthday, my husband checked with the restaurant with regard to my need for gluten free food and the staff could not have been more helpful. We had a wonderful meal which we both thoroughly enjoyed and fantastic service from our lovely waitress Neringa. Thank you, you made my birthday meal memorable.So all in all we loved our stay at this hotel, we have recommended it to friends, who have already booked for August and we hope to return in the not too distant future ourselves.","June 15, 2019","2    Sunborn London

126,Why do hotels like this think they have the right to make up pathetic excuses as to why something happened when you make a complaint?I made a complaint yesterday morning as to why the reception staff let several people queue jump in front of me. Apparently the reason is that they have no control over queue jumping and the unwelcoming reception staff are happy to let that happen. So if you are going there just go straight to the reception desk by passing anyone that appears to be queueingMy compensation for my inconvenience was a late check out but I was told by email at 10:30. That was the time I left the room. Nobody could be bothered to phone me in my room the evening before. Secondly my advice is not to have breakfast there. Everything is bland and if you like several cups of tea or coffee you will be up and down as you can only get single cups. Better to go to Starbucks near the station if you want decent coffee. I go this hotel several times a year but the customer service and cutbacks are getting worse. The rooms are great but a hotel can’t be judged on the rooms alone.,"June 14, 2019","2    Sunborn London

The room was well appointed, clean and spacious and benefitted from a balcony where it was possible to sit. Shower room small but has everything you need. Very comfortable bed and quiet despite aircraft taking off from or landing at nearby London City Airport. Located next to the Excel and about a 5 minute walk from DLR where it takes about 30 mins to reach central London.

Had lunch in the bar area - this was very nice - and we were well served by the friendly bar staff. Dinner was not such a great experience - mainly because I think they were understaffed. The starter was tasty - a ham terrine - but it was advertised with sour dough and that wasn't on the plate when they brought it. It was impossible to catch a server and when I eventually got a senior staff member they offered to send it out - but I had finished. The mains - rib eye - was O.K. but the jus had a very funny taste. The restaurant did, however, offer very acceptable wine by the glass. So a mixed bag.

We had ordered a family room which had a king size bed and a sofa bed. I am quite slight and slept on the sofa bed. Sadly this was one of the most uncomfortable and sleepless nights I have had. Staff put up the bed but one of the legs started to collapse in the middle of the night! Sadly we were unable to use the bar as a massive party of hundreds was in progress. There was a makeshift bar for residents but party goers spread there too. I would however like to thank and praise the staff who were having to cope with all these somewhat rowdy drunk people.

Engaging, efficient and looked like they enjoyed working there. Breakfast on one of the mornings was good. Housekeeping were friendly & unobtrusive. Reception staff greeted with a smile.The Bad... The rest of the bar staff looked like they HATED being there. Getting a drink was a chore, frustrating & expensive. I kind of expect more than a miserable reluctance to be served, or even for asking for the bill. OMG the breakfast is not a great experience either... who cooks sausages on ONE side only, pink in the middle? Butter only on selected tables, plates whisked away immediately after your last bite, the worst toaster ever... and did I mention the half cooked sausages? The Ugly... Why oh why did they remove the luxury champagne coloured carpet in the rooms? It was literally LOVELY and a major selling point. My room had an industrial blue coloured carpet for some reason, my business partner described his room as ""lino & laminate""! With rooms, food and bar tab, our stay cost us about £2.6k.

Limited choice of cereals, the cooked breakfast was at best lukewarm the fried eggs were rubbery resembling ones you used to be able to buy from a joke shop! I can't imaging how long the whole thing had been in the so called warmers to be in the state they were.We arrived at breakfast at 8am so perhaps they were cooked at 6.30am when breakfast were first served. Not only was the food terrible, since we last visited they have stopped serving fresh tea and coffee, you now have to collect your own from an urn, which by the taste of the tea bad been standing as long as the breakfast...stewed tea and tepid food, not good enough.At the price you pay for a nights stay I expect far more than this.

141,"We booked afternoon tea here on a Saturday afternoon and had a lovely day!The drinks and then the tea took a little while to arrive but I suspect that's because they make them to order given that we made some slight changes to what we wanted. The hot chocolates were lovely as they were a cup of hot milk with a large chocolate stirrer. I've not had one of those anywhere other than at home before and it was delicious.The sandwiches were lovely, the scones were still warm and the cakes were perfect and all very fresh. We ordered extra sandwiches because we were all so hungry!When the waitress was pouring our prosecco she was chatting and asked us why we were there. Said we were celebrating a belated birthday and then the conversation moved on.At the end of the tea, she surprised us by bringing a large piece of delicious sticky toffee pudding with happy birthday written into a decorative chocolate. I was so impressed with this as she had just picked up on the birthday comment and done it off her own back. I think that extra touch really showed a flair for customer service and passion for her job plus a company that allows their staff to make decisions and I always admire that.We then moved into the bar area and spent another 4 hours drinking cocktails.Our experience was ruined slightly by an unreasonable family sitting next to us who were having issues checking in and were arguing loudly with the manager. They were making self-important statements about how much power they had at work and how much business they would move from the hotel and saying things such as 'I work in the hospitality industry'...generally just being a pain and also swearing which was unpleasant. The management team seemed to deal with them very well and resolved the situation.We ended up spending around 6 hours in total and all felt well looked after and relaxed.

155,"I booked the spa and afternoon tea through one of the discount websites. To be honest I didn't check trip advisor which is unlike me, so coming closer to our booking I was really nervous. The spa treatment was a back massage and facial. It wasn't the worst but it certainly wasn't the best. The treatment rooms were clean and well presented. However, there was no sink so the therapist had to leave the room to wash her hands. The room had windows and even though the blinds were closed, it was still quite bright. The walls were very thin so conversations in the next room could be overheard. The massage and facial were ok. I asked for very firm but felt too much pressure was applied to my bones which is still painful. My daughter had the opposite experience and said her treatment was fine.The afternoon tea was booked for just after our treatment. However when we got to reception we were advised that the restaurant didn't open until 12.30. Reception contacted the restaurant manager who came up and apologised that they had not received the email with the booking. However as the restaurant was not open, we could have a drink on the house until the restaurant opened. As soon as the restaurant was open we were promptly collected and seated. We were offered a choice of hot drinks and given the menu. We were served by Salomey. Neither of us eat red meat or cheese so the sandwich selection was limited as the only thing we would eat was the salmon. Despite this Salomey said she would check with the chef whether they had chicken or turkey. She returned with chicken and salmon sandwiches. They were to die for. The afternoon tea included mini scones, bakewell tarts, brownies, pannacotta and macaroons. Everything tasted great and was one of the best afternoon teas I've had. The tea was freshly brewed leaves hot and plenty of substance, not the weak watered down rubbish that seems to served in most places. Champagne was also part of the deal but as we didn't have it, Salomey spoke to the restaurant manager and asked if our bottled waters that were not included in the voucher could be substituted. She was a great waitress, friendly, helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Thanks to both her and the restaurant manager for making what would have been a disappointing experience more than positive. The hotel is in a great location, is attractive and the staff we came in contact with were all pleasant. I would definitely go back and would also love the opportunity for an overnight stay.","March 30, 2019","2    Sunborn London

156,"I booked 3 rooms for 4 nights for a business trip. The cabins are pleasant although a little dated, the beds are comfortable and it’s lovely staying riverside to open up onto the deck with great views. Reception staff are very pleasant, however the services levels with the restaurant and bar fall well below expectations and staff adopt a couldn’t care less attitude. The restaurant can’t accept more than 10 covers at any one time due to the size of the kitchen. I saw numerous residents turned away because of this reason. What type of hotel cannot offer reasonable restaurant facilities for its guests? Breakfast costs £20 for full and £15 for continental. Completely overpriced for self service with limited breakfast items. There is more fruit choice in my supermarket lunch box than what the hotel offered. Also, only 1 x 4 slice toaster available at breakfast time with constant queues. Various residents complaining it was unacceptable. After eating elsewhere one evening we returned to the hotel bar to be told it was closed - even to residents! Staff constantly apologising for the shortfalls. I was hoping for a great experience, but it was a disappointment.","March 27, 2019","2    Sunborn London

160,"We tried Sunborn for a different kind of hotel experience and we weren't disappointed. Our package included an executive double room, dinner for two and breakfast. The large room was fantastic with a polished wood finish to all the walls and furniture. It felt very grand. We had a small balcony with a view over the water to the far side of the dock. We found the room modern, stylish, very clean and equal to any 5 star hotel that we've stayed at previously. It was only the weather (poor) that prevented us from enjoying ourselves out on deck. The main stairway is quite elaborate and stunning and is clearly the central feature inside the yacht. Our dinner was excellent, with scallops followed by fillet steaks and cheese boards (1 each). All the food was fresh and cooked to perfection. The cheese boards had the biggest variety and largest pieces of cheese we've ever received on cheese boards - each board contained more than sufficient for two people. Breakfast was buffet style and once again offered a good variety of cooked, cereal and continental style food. We found service to be excellent and will be back again in warmer weather.","March 20, 2019","2    Sunborn London

161,"Upon entering the hotel I was kind of underwhelmed at the decor. The lifts were a pain as you had to put your card in the slot to enable the lifts to work and the card reader was playing up slightly, so time wasted playing around with the slot was irritating. The cabin was how a cabin would be expected to look with wood furniture. The bed was UNCOMFORTABLE and the pillows were lacklustre, I'd say that the beds and pillows in a Premier Inn were much better. The bathroom needed updating in my opinion. We decided to go to the bar area behind reception which was the only place open for a drink as the bar terrace upstairs was closed. The bar area was kind of underwhelming. I fancied a coffee and cake but was told that they only had a couple of muffins left over from breakfast so I had one of those. The coffee arrived and was luke warm.We drank our drink and sat there feeling that the common areas could be updated somewhat.Luckily we were going out to eat that night and managed to find an escape room nearby to do as couldn't have sat in the bar all evening.Breakfast was again underwhelming not a very good selection and was luke warm.Overall the whole experience left us leaving kind of deflated and seems like an effort to even write this review as the whole thing seemed very how would I say normal ! I think for this place to sell itself as an executive accommodation they need to seriously upgrade or have a look at the reviews written and think about their marketing.","March 18, 2019","2    Sunborn London

162,"All of the workers but specially josh, kenzie, Deb, and the manager (sorry I forgot your name) were the absolute best when it came to hospitality, service, and friendliness. Gave my friend and I so many recommendations on what to do around the city and where to eat. When we first arrived they let us store our luggage until checkin time. We stayed in a room with 4 other people and a private shower for us. Everything was clean and the private lockers worked well. If you don’t have your own lock they can provide you one with a 5€ deposit that you get back once you turn the lock in after your stay. I read a review about the “dark bar” and the only time it is dark is at night time lol. They have happy hour Thursday- Sunday in the afternoon and it is a great time as it seems like everyone in the town knows about this place (but not too crowded).

The only problem is that the hostel is situated close to a railway and the noise could wake you up early in the morning if you are a light sleeper. The breakfast includes toast, cereals, tea or coffee, milk but no hot food. The hostel offers the opportunity to cook your own food in a well equipped kitchen. You can lock your stuff in your room and leave your luggages in a storage. Also they provide you with towels, lockers, adapters and whatever you need. The rooms and toilets are clean.

I was worried about the noise from the trains because they are right next to the hostel, but it was actually fine during the night! The main downside was the bar was not the social gathering place I expected. It was full of locals, an older crowd, so it was tough to hang out there with other backpackers. I found my bed to be fine, but be warned that in the 22 bed dorm there are some bunk beds pushed so close together that those guests were essentially sharing a large bed with a stranger. I definitely would not have been happy if I had been assigned one of those beds, because it seemed inappropriate and awkward.

On the downsides: the kitchen was tiny tiny tiny but I didn't really use it so it didn't bother me, just FYI. Also, I feel like the (small) amount of bathrooms and toilets can be a problem if ever you get up and go to bed at the same time as other people. Again, it wasn't an issue for me because I get up earlier than most guests and also go to bed earlier than them.

The room and bedding were clean and comfortable, lockers provided as well as a deposit safe available. In the room there was a single plug with a multiplier for electrical items. The WiFi was free and of a decent speed too. The state were friendly and helpful if you needed to ask anything.

In both cases I look at details and I always make my choice after reading reviews.On this occasion I was with 5 other girls, so we were looking for a young place full of live. Reviews was good, so The Walrus would have been our place.I must say that the Walrus is the right place to make party. The Pub is full on nice people, nice music and fast service.Dormitory was also nice, but common bathrooms was not always clean, that's why I left a score 4 out of 5. Of course it depends from the good manners of guests, but probably they could organize an extraordinary cleaning service expecially at night.In any case I think it's the best choice in you are looking for an hostel.Top location, close to underground and London Eye.The manager is a gentleman and I knows perfectly how customer sevice works.We strongly suggest this place and you will not disagree.","February 2, 2018","3    The Walrus Hostel

We had a lovely welcoming where Alex showed us around the hostel and explained a few events that were going on throughout our stay. The hostel was very easy to get to with 2 train stations within a 2 min walk. Only a 5min walk to Westminster Bridge and the London Eye as well as the first stop for many of the city bus tours. The room was clean and had lockers and a small sink. Each floor had a shower and toilet both of which were consistently clean and also the showers looked newly renovated. There was also a well-equipped kitchen. Each morning we had the free breakfast in the hostel bar, which consisted of toast, cereal, fresh fruit, tea/coffee, and juices. In the evenings we would have a drink down in the bar, which was often quite busy and had a great atmosphere. A bonus of staying in the hostel and drinking in the bar was the 15% off as well as 15% off food at the sister pub just down the road. My only qualms about this hostel is that it could get quite loud due to being so close to the train. As I’m a heavy sleeper this didn’t particularly bother me but it did for others.

Check-in was easy and they have specials for guests. When you get out make a left and go through the tunnel.. It was amazing --there is a venue in the middle of it. After a long night, you can hangout and watch the street artists paint their heart out. If you are looking for a quiet paradise..

I've stayed in several different rooms, and they have all been clean and well looked after. Free breakfast is basic, but filling, and having the pub just downstairs is convenient. Aside from the great price, this hostel has absolutely prime location. It's just a few minutes walk from a lot of the major monuments (Big Ben, London Eye, etc.), close to a tube stop and Waterloo station, and I've never seen a reason to stay anywhere else.

201,"The Walrus Hostel was so-so, nothing amazing but decent enough for a short stay. The bottom floor is a very busy bar, which is also where you check in. Bar has good prices, but was too busy for my opinion and didn't seem to be all hostel guests. There was no common room besides this area.The room itself was fine, bed was comfy with bedding and towels provided.Showers were okay as well but no space or hooks to put your items. Overall the hostel seemed a dated. Also, if you are bothered by train noise then bring ear plugs. It didn't bother me, but I've also spent a lot of time sleeping on trains so I can sleep through the noise.Breakfast in the morning was quite nice - bread, cereals, fruit, coffee, juices, etc.For the price of £26 you can't really beat it.

Decent buffet in the morning, nothing handmade.No hangers in the room to hang your coats, and the power sockets not always are closed to the bed.It would take a little effort to improve the overall experience, especially with the toilets and the showers. All the taps I put my hands on were half broken, with leaks and the shower head water didn't want to stay in place, keeping on falling. No heating whatsoever. No bins for paper towels and a generally poor looking environment. Kitchen was handy but poorly equipped, sign with ""free coffee and tee"" but no actual tee was there. Few pans but no decent cooking tools. Also cold room, which is a shame since it could be a nice alternative meeting point for hostel's guests. No markers or labels to to use to put your name on the food as requested. I would keep the music in the bar lower, so people could actually interact more.","November 30, 2016","3    The Walrus Hostel

205,"This location is perfect--it's right around the corner from the Eye (just checked, 8 min walk according to Google), and in an OK area (not the safest feeling near the train tracks). Rooms are small but cozy, heat worked fine. Lockers at the beds were adequate. Shower was clean-ish, but cold--one of the windows had broken so it kept swinging open so it got pretty chilly in there. Hot water was iffy as well, but adequate for my needs (quick showers are a must for hostels!). Overall this place was nice, I'd stay here again if I needed a spot right downtown. I didn't like that there were not a lot of bathrooms but I never had to wait in line either, and it was pretty busy, so that's probably just my own weird paranoia. This is a pretty decent hostel given the price, but it's really nothing fancy. Would probably stay somewhere else given how great London's tube system is, but if you like being near the river, this place is perfectly good. Bar downstairs is also pretty nice, though they cant pour a decent Guinness which makes me think the bartenders might not be that great on mixed drinks--but it's a cheap kind of hole in the wall feeling place, so again, get what you pay for. Overall this was decent and tolerable, but given how great London transport is, I'd probably never stay here again unless it was New Years and I wanted to be near the Eye. In which case I would 100% stay here if the prices were ok. Also, you can get to the roof if you schmooze your way with the right people. It's a great view up there, but I understand that they dont really want to invite people up to the top for safety reasons.

People only spend a night or two here so maybe that is why the ratings aren't bad. Staff cleans but the carpet and linoleum simply have to be replaced.

The room itself was very clean and despite being on a main road was very quiet. However the room was tiny. The bathroom even smaller!

227,We booked for location and price. We knew the rooms were small. However one room out of three was in basement. No windows. THE SMELL OF SEWER AND WORSE MADE ME GAG! I would’ve slept on street before I stayed in this room. I don’t know how the couple managed through the night. But they were there for 8 hours total and went to lobby to wait for rest of us so they could get out of basement room. We believe this room might have black mold. The other rooms were extremely small but we expected this and since close to train station during London MLB series of Yankees and Red Sox we chose to stay one night. But the basement room is a no-go,"July 6, 2019","4    Point A Hotel, London Kings Cross St Pancras

Little difficult to get in the shower because of the wall and sink. They should move the shower door too the other end.

272,"The hotel is in a nice area of London, many students, coffee shops, restaurants . I had a delicious vegan ice cream across the street, and loved to have breakfast at the Bloomsbury cafe. Delicious coffee and the avocado and egg sandwich on sourdough bread was super. The area is vibrant, The rooms of the hotel are small but the value for money is great. I appreciate that it was so clean. Coming into the showers in the morning was a positive surprise, Very clean and big enough room. Not a problem to share with others. If you like shopping you reach Oxford street after a 30 min walk. The room can be hot in the summer. I closed the window at night since there is traffic on the street. I sleep with earplugs so no problem for me.","July 6, 2019","5    St. Athans Hotel

273,"I was visiting London at the end of a hiking holiday. The hotel is actually a series of buildings converted from homes. I think there may be apartments in some of the buildings. I was in 28 Tavistock Place (as I recall)--in probably the tiniest hotel room I have ever had, with a twin bed, but spotless. The room was ensuite, again, probably the tiniest bathroom I've ever had in a hotel, but also spotless. The staff was really friendly and helpful, and the location is wonderful--a few blocks from Russell Square. I spent all of my time out of the room exploring London, so it was great for me, but probably would not be good for someone expecting to spend time in the room because it was REALLY tiny.","July 5, 2019","5    St. Athans Hotel

275,"Just love this place! The hotel was really easy to find, just a short walk from Kings Cross. Was greeted with a really warm friendly welcome. The room was clean & functional, we had the room with a bunk bed & a double bed. The beds were very comfortable, slept great. As it was a hot evening had the window open all night & didn't hear any noise (room was at the back of the hotel) Was useful that there was a fan in the room also. Loved the old solid furniture in the room and was pleased that proper coat hangers that you can actually take out the wardrobe easily were provided. The bathroom was compact as expected but we were only there a short time. Russell Square tube station is about 5 mins walk away, at night walking back to the hotel felt perfectly safe. Had our breakfast downstairs in the coffee house, was a delicious breakfast. Appreciated the 10% off & a free hot drink voucher. Would definitely stay here again as a brilliant base for a London trip, would recommend to anyone. Just a small bit of feedback, perhaps a headboard could be fitted to the bed? Was quite a large gap behind the bed due to the recess, was a bit difficult to sit up in bed comfortably. All in all, a brilliant place to stay and loved the quirky features. 10/10","June 30, 2019","5    St. Athans Hotel

281,"We've just returned from a 4 night family stay at St Athans and we were very impressed. For this price point and location the standard of the hotel is excellent, high levels of cleanliness throughout the shared bathrooms, common areas and bedroom. The staff were friendly and approachable and the hotel overall had a very cared for feel.The area is excellent, leafy and quite quiet but very close to St Pancras, Kings Cross and Euston stations, and walking distance to the main central areas (we walked to Embankment pier on the Thames for the river taxi one morning and it took about 35 minutes).We stayed in room 17 which has a double, bunks and a single bed; large wardrobe, tv and sink. There was plenty of space for what we wanted, which was just a place to rest our heads after busy days of sightseeing. There are ample shared bathrooms, we never had any issue finding one free at all. There is no bar or restaurant, but the coffee shop on the lower ground floor is open for breakfast and lunch and the hotel has a comfortable and spacious TV lounge, with seating for 6-8 people.The only - very minor - issues were that you had to ring the doorbell to be let in the main door every time, rather than the key cards working here also. I understand this is a security issue but with three young children I don't think there was one occasion where we returned without one at least desperate to go to the toilet so the extra (albeit very short) wait was a little difficult! The other one is that the bedroom window was an original sash window, which opened fully at the bottom. As our youngest child is nearly 6 now it wasn't an issue for us, but might be if you have younger / more prone to adventure children with you!Overall we were hugely impressed and we look forward to visiting again!","June 1, 2019","5    St. Athans Hotel

284,"St Athans provided decent value family accommodation that was walking distance to the main London attractions as well as the St Pancras station to get the train to Paris. To access the room, you needed to walk up a stair case. Our room had a bunk bed with a double bed, while the bathroom was smaller than a cruise ship, with a big step up, where you needed to be careful in using the hot water. The room did not contain a fridge.I appreciated the ability to check in slightly early and luggage store on our departure day as we caught an 8pm train to Paris. After walking around London from early morning, we were also able to relax in the lounge area at the front of the building on return for our luggage before heading to the train to watch tv and use the reading materials. This reinforced my positive impression of the St Athans Hotel.","April 18, 2019","5    St. Athans Hotel

285,"I had a single en suite room which I found suitable for a four-day stay. It was simple and basic, looked and felt clean. My room had quite new bathroom fixtures, a large window looking into the rear (nothing to see, but it let in light and air), a closet with five hangars, and a small and wall-mounted flat-screen TV. There was room on the floor for a suitcase. It would be helpful if there were a hook for a coat or toiletries bag.The location is convenient to many things and quiet. There are no bars close by. There is a separate cafe on the lower level which offers a discount if you stay at the hotel. There is also a cafe across the street with a few more options. On the same block there are restaurants that are quick/cheap and mid-range, as well as a late-night shop for snacks, candy, fruit, wine. The Russell Square Tube station is about a 5-8 minute walk, easy even if you have a larger wheeled bag. We walked to Westminster, Victoria Station and elsewhere, but took the Tube ""home"" at end of day.St. Athans appears to be comprised of a few attached buildings, once homes, but converted into small hotels that are all now under St. Athans. So, after checking in, you may have to go out to the street and down a few doors to get to your room. It feels like a reasonably safe area.","April 8, 2019","5    St. Athans Hotel

Close to tube and Kings Cross Station.Cool neighborhood.Good pre-arrival communication.Cons:Tiny room - the pictures online must have been taken with a trick camera lens because they looked huge. They were not huge. We kept stubbing our toes and tripping over each other.Shared bathroom that was - hopefully? - clean. Light was too dim to be sure. Door locks were not always functional. Treacherous stairs that were extremely difficult to get our baggage up and down. The kids were frightened of falling.Tilted floors that resulted in our feet being higher than our heads - I suppose it’s good for circulation or something.I would NOT want to be in this hotel in a fire! Overall, be sure that your family is prepared for the shared bathroom. We weren’t even there for 12 hours, so it was fine.

I got to the room and it was very dated and VERY small with a small sink in the corner and I have to say I felt like I was in some kind of a hospital rather than a hotel. I would never have been able to relax here which for me is what I expect from a hotel room. its a real shame as I really dont like to leave negative reviews but from my experience this is how I felt and I really do stress this is my own fault for not doing my research before booking checking location and not seeing that it was a shared bathroom.","February 10, 2019","5    St. Athans Hotel

288,"They are very honest about being a basic hotel. But if you want an affordable, clean, lodging in a terrific location, this is a good choice. The pros are location, location, location. Easy to walk everywhere in central London, close to the Tube, and close to many lovely squares, restaurants, shops. It is also clean and the staff is generally very helpful and friendly. The con was about our first room there. For the first week, we stayed in a very small room which was not fun to come home to, and there was a great deal of noise in the hallway as we were close to a door leading into the back area. (I suspect the noise we heard was employees, not other guests, in general). But when we returned after a week away, we were in a larger, quite nice room, in a quiet hallway on the second (their first) floor. So I would advise asking about the room and being sure that it suits your needs. I do recommend it; just ask about the room.","December 28, 2018","5    St. Athans Hotel

290,"Stayed here for one night at the end of October 2018. Location as many others have pointed out is excellent, being about 5-10 mins walk from Kings Cross and St Pancras mainline stations and Russell Square tube station. Lots of good historical sites and museums are nearby as well as many highly rated restaurants.My single room on the top floor (servants' quarters of the old house :-)) was warm and comfortable and more than adequate in size for my needs. If you have a big suitcase such as I did, you just need to be careful when navigating the tight stairs to get up to the 3rd floor but it's to be expected when staying in any older house with character. My bathroom was just across the hall, immaculately clean and never had to wait even though the hotel was fully booked that night. The cafe downstairs serves a great Full English breakfast plus a variety of other healthier options.For me though, the highlight of this stay was definitely the staff. Every single employee, without exception, was friendly, attentive and welcoming. Having stayed in many hotels around the world I know how rare it is to find one where every member of staff is smiling and looking like they are genuinely happy to be working there. After checkout, they kindly let me leave my suitcase there while I went to attend to some matters in another part of London. Unfortunately, on my way back, it started pouring with rain and I got completely soaked. However, when I got back to the hotel they were kind enough to let me sit in their lounge and use one of their hairdryers until I managed to dry myself off! Can't beat that kind of service! Will definitely stay there again next time I'm in town.","December 6, 2018","5    St. Athans Hotel

Everyone that worked there was very nice and always willing to help or even just talk.The hotel is really interesting because it is over 200 years old and is a protected building, that is why there's no elevator, they can't ""alter"" a protected building (fun fact I learned from one of the members of the staff). The bathrooms were always clean and I never had to wait because someone else was using it, also, my room had a little sink and a mirror which were very useful as well... The hotel has access to a cafe that serves great beakfast and has a 10% discount. The bed (matress) wasn't the most comfortable but that is okay! I would definitely stay again!

The staff is very friendly and helpful, you can leave your luggage before arrival and after departure w/o any concerns. Loaction is rellay great, it is a 5 mins walk to Russel Square subway or St. Pancras station. There are some nice pubs nearby and also a shopping center where you can get everything you need.

Nor did the come up with the thoughts of providing table fans in that scorching heat. The keys failed to function to evening in a row. Once, we had to wait long for the person at the reception to show up to fix the keycard.

306,"This is a lovely little gem of a find.....5 minutes walk from Euston train station and close proximity to central London (20 minutes walk to Oxford Street). St. Athans has really nice helpful staff who happily assisted us with directions to get to places on foot.Our room was clean and cosy, it was in the basement below street level but this didn't matter to us. The only negative is the toilet is up a flight of stairs and the shower room is along the corridor.....again this didn't matter to us as they were available to use when needed.Breakfast wasn't included but we were given ONE voucher for a free coffee (two of us but only one free drink) and a 10% off voucher for the total bill in their little coffee shopAt £100 for the night would definitely come again","July 8, 2018","5    St. Athans Hotel

308,"A very affordable hotel in central London. Was my second time in the city, this time on a cheaper budget. Got there and the “reception” couldn’t find my reservation. I had to go over to the computer and find it myself. I really liked the room. Free WiFi, tv, very cozy and a surprisingly good bed. Clean, but the shower drain was full and it took ages for the water to go away. Me and my wife went out and did the town. Got back and went to bed and that’s when I decided that I would never go back to St Athans. The walls are extremely thin. Stayed on the bottom floor and everytime someone entered the place it sounded like a horde of elephants ran through. You can hear a cough through the entire hotel. I laid awake till 2-3 every night because of it.Cleaning was good but they just skipped over it one of the days. Thanks. When we checked out I asked where we could get a taxi and got the answer “just go out and when you see a cab with a lit taxi sign just wave your hand”. Oh gee, thanks! Never would’ve thought of that. I actually asked because in the room pamphlet it said: “we’ll gladly book a taxi for you”. Guess not.It sounds miserable, I know. The room is still cozy and if you’re on a tight budget I guess you could reconsider St Athans as an option. Although I’m not going back.","June 22, 2018","5    St. Athans Hotel

315,"It's a fine place if you know what you are getting. If you are expecting what an American would call a Hotel, that's not what this is. So here's some helpful information for Americans looking at booking this place.Europe has hostels and hotels. This one technically resides in the hotel category because of private rooms, but it feels more like other hostels I've stayed in rather than a hotel. Rooms- are tiny from an American hotel frame of reference. It's fine based on other comparable products in the same category. Do not book this place if you are looking for space. This is room for sleeping and that's about it. Bathrooms-There are private and shared. I had a private bathroom that was within my room. If you are thinking of an American hotel bathroom, that's not what this is. It's a bathroom pod installed at some other time. After all, the building (like most other buildings) is a hundred years old. The pod is the equivalent of a small RV camper bathroom. That's the size. Most RV bathrooms actually have more room around the sink. My 5th wheel camper bathroom was twice as large as the bathroom pod in the room I stayed in. Same materials for finishes. Toiletries-bring your own shampoo, conditioner, and soap. This place doesn't provide those things. My personal experience: Staff was nice. I booked through Expedia and there wasn't enough information for me to make an informed decision and when we arrived I had my wife and teenage girls in one room and I was in another. My girls didn't feel safe and people were coming and going till after midnight. The doors were thin enough that it felt uncomfortable. There's a sense of privacy Americans are used to with hotel doors typically being solid core wood with gap seals so most hall noise is eliminated. That sense of noise privacy did not exist here. Our private bathrooms were not functional for our needs. The bed I slept in had a support right down the middle of it and the mattress was very basic so every time I turned on my side the support bar was on my hip and caused pain. I hope they fix that bed. I couldn't sleep that night. One other major odd thing was a painted cast iron plumbing pipe that came down in the corner of the room and you could hear water coming down when people used the bathroom. All in all-the other reviews didn’t properly convey what I should expect. It just was not up to our basic standard for accommodations and I booked another place the next morning and we left. The manager wouldn’t refund any money which was prepaid for a week long stay, and I lost over a thousand dollars by booking this place without a clear understanding of what I was getting into. The reason he gave was that we didn’t give him a chance to rectify our dissatisfaction. Unfortunately, there was no way to do that since it would’ve required a major construction remodel. Nothing against his hotel. It was just not what I was expecting. It sucks to lose that much money on a vacation, but I hope this review is helpful for Americans who, when they read the word “Hotel” and have a certain expectation, recognize this is not what we in America consider a hotel.","April 14, 2018","5    St. Athans Hotel

322,"During my fifteen-night stay in the St. Athans hotel, I was fairly pleased most every day. The staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers, is a very friendly group of people that is always helpful and accommodating. The hotel itself is located perfectly, providing the feeling of a big city without the chaos of some other, more densely populated parts of London. There are plenty of places to eat nearby, and the British Museum is only a ten or so minute walk from the hotel. Additionally, the Russell Square and St. Pancras/King's Cross stations are both a few minutes away on foot. The rooms of the hotel are nice, but I can only speak to the more communal rooms (four and three beds). Our room had a little sink and mirror in it, but the toilets and showers are communal, and located in the stairwells. It was a little bit cramped for three people staying in one room, but nothing too bad. The beds are quite comfortable.Now for the less favorable aspects of the hotel. There is a system in place that requires all guests ring a doorbell to enter the hotel. This is an understandable security measure, but it can get a bit annoying (for the staff as well I am sure). As I mentioned before the communal bathrooms, while not a dealbreaker for me, may be difficult for others. There is also no breakfast offered with the hotel, but it is connected to a nice coffee shop (with a discount) that is convenient and tasty. Overall, the good definitely outweighs the bad, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. I would also recommend for those that would like a convenient hotel in London that is affordable, friendly, and clean.","January 25, 2018","5    St. Athans Hotel

If needed the No 91 bus around the corner will take you to Trafalgar Square.The hotel is old, no lift so ask before booking if a ground floor room is available if stairs are of a concern. There is a café in the basement well worth a visit for a coffee or meal. Most rooms do not have a toilet but one or two so ask again before booking.But the main reason is the rooms are clean, staff very helpful and the rates are excellent for those on a budget and the location is excellent.","January 5, 2018","5    St. Athans Hotel

330,"Normally these places (hotels made out of converted houses in residential streets) tend to be poor. This place is anything but. I was on my own for a business trip to London which I do weekly, so I get to stay in some proper dives, as I have limited budget, but this place is priced about right, if anything good value. The room I had was on the basement level facing the front. At least there weren't bars on the windows. I could hear people walking past at street level, which is an indication of how quiet it was...I was amazed. It was a sunny summers evening and I could hear the swifts chirping away to one another - very nice. There was a bit of noise later on, when the laundry was picked up, and again when staff came out to get something from the lock-ups outside the window, but nothing too onerous.The bed was very comfy - I slept very well. My room had a double and a single bed so it would have been perfect for a small family too.The en-suite was big and very well appointed. They provide soaps and stuff but I prefer to use my own, and the towles were big, clean and fluffy! The shower was powerful, and very well done, in fact full marks all around for the fit, finish and decor, and everything worked, including plugs by the bedside table for charging stuff overnight (little things eh?!)I don't do breakfast but it was included in the price which was another nice surprise. I had a wonder around the restaurant area (its only used for breakfast, no evening meals, you'll need to find your own) and it looked well laid out, plenty of seats, and some outside space for the sunny mornings, and bean-to-cup coffee (most important)I had a coffee in my room, so theres a kettle and all the usually stuff like tea bags, instant coffee etc.So, quiet, comfy, safe, well appointed, and only 5 mins walk from Barons Court Tube.Will use again if I can get a room!NB: If this review has been interesting/informative please like/thumbs up.","June 20, 2019","6    The W14 Kensington

A very good mattress, giving one of the best night's sleep I've had in a hotel. (Great pillows, too.) Black-out curtains, so no early wakening. I was on my own, but they gave me a very spacious room with a big double bed (and another spare single). Great bathroom with generous proportions and a fantastic rain shower (with extra hose). All very clean. It's exactly as it looks in the photos - everything looks brand new, right down to the carpets. The road itself is very quiet - you can't believe you're in London. A very nice, quiet area, yet a really short walk from the tube - practically round the corner. The staff were all very friendly and ready to help in any way. Breakfast was included, which is a bonus these days, so I wasn't expecting much, but what I found was a nice, spacious light-filled dining room with a generous come-again buffet. You could stuff yourself, if inclined. I had cereal, toast, juice and fruit, but I could have had croissants, meat, cheese, yoghurt and much more. Endless tea, coffee and juices.

With the extra door closed it was ok.Reception were very helpful - they lent me a phone charger because I’d forgotten mine.Breakfast was ok, not the best but perfectly acceptable, it’s served in a cabin in the garden and it’s nice they do have outside space it had furniture out there so you can go outside.Overall, I would consider staying there again.","April 6, 2019","6    The W14 Kensington

I stayed here to attend the London Book Fair in Olympia and it was around a ten-minute walk, and around £6 / £7 by taxi. I stayed in a treble room as I was with a colleague and it was great as we had separate bedrooms. The room was quiet, the shower was lovely and I would stay here again.","March 17, 2019","6    The W14 Kensington

Its spacious, amazing shower and has everything you could need. Close the Olympia and great access to tube to other placed. Lots of restaurants and shops close by. Only bad thing i would say is the hairdryer needs a longer lead. I had to sit on the floor to use it otherwise it didnt reach - but only a small thing. Fab place otherwise - so much so i have booked again for my event @ Olympis next year.

Breakfast is continental and served in annex built in the garden, there is also outside seating here for smokers. The hotel was in walking distance of the tube station and about a 15 min walk to the Hammersmith Apollo.

It was spacious, clean and the beds had Hypnos mattresses - I had the best nights' sleep I have ever had in a hotel. The rainfall shower was lovely, and I would say the only improvement would be if there had been hooks on the wall for the towels, which would have made it easier with three sharing and they were also mentioned as being the way to prevent the unnecessary washing of towels.Breakfast was included in the reasonable cost, and the buffet was perfectly adequate with choice. The croissant/roll warmer could have warmed them slightly more given the cold temperature outside. The breakfast room is great. Vending machines useful. Equidistant from Baron's Court and West Kensington station making District and Piccadilly lines both within easy reach.I will be back!","February 3, 2019","6    The W14 Kensington

The first night I was bitten and assumed it was a mosquito, but then the same thing happened again, I raised the issue with staff who mover me to another room however it was much smaller then what I had paid for.Finally the shower did lose pressure, at times it came to a complete stop.Overall whilst not the worst place I have ever stayed it’s not the best and if I had my time over I prob wouldn’t stay there again ","October 29, 2018","6    The W14 Kensington

People with heavy big suitcases will struggle.The breakfas room is the usual self service buffet affair, but I was disappointed with the pre-prepared toast and kept-warm croissant which were dry and hard. The yoghourt was a big help-yourself bowl kind, not individual servings.My biggest (and my colleagues too) gripe was that the shower didnt work properly but rather suddenly slowed from a gentle cascade to a mere dribble from the showerhead. When I and my colleagues complained the management appeared surprised... neither myself nor my colleagues believe their surprise was genuine, more of a 'B' movie act. Would I stay again?

The subway station is about two streets away, and using this you can be in the centre of London in about 10 minutes. The hotel itself looks gorgeous. It seems like an old fancy English city house from the outside, and the inside is modern and cozy. The reception personnel was exceptionally friendly and gave us all the information we needed on transport in London. They were also patient, since they remained friendly as I didn't understand at all how oyster cards worked :) Our room was beautiful, cozy and clean. The bathroom was nice and modern.Breakfast was simple, but everthing you need is present. The orange juice was obviously a powder though, but the other beverages were good.

Our room was a triple and located on the third floor, which is 3 flights up. No lift. However, the lovely gentlemen at the desk take care of your luggage so that is nice. Make sure to call them to get your luggage when you're leaving. Our room had a queen and a twin bed. The way it is set up, it was as if the twin was in its own separate area. Modern fixtures (rainfall shower head) and we did not need adapters even though we had them. The room was small and clean and we had room for the 3 of us comfortably. Since hotel is located in a neighborhood setting, it was nice and quiet. Breakfast is offered with the stay. The best part is it is located in its own separate building steps behind the hotel next to a cute outdoor seating area. Breakfast options were the standard cereal, hard boiled eggs, pastries... Nothing special, but doable. (We ended up eating at a good cafe around the corner called Cafe Continente. Good food and good prices.)The gentlemen at the front desk were very helpful with suggestions on what to do and when we needed things printed.

They responded a day later (in a nutshell) with “Hope you’re doing good!! It is sad about your step mum but I wish we could be more helpful but we can’t refund you.” It appears they didn’t even read my email properly as there wasn’t a mention of the fact it’s my mum as well and a double bereavement.The event we were attending has a non refundable policy and they were compassionate enough to fully refund us, I’d hoped that the hotel might have been the same.","May 13, 2018","6    The W14 Kensington

371,"Overall a positive experience - in a good location, but needs attention to a few fundamental areas.This could so easily have been 4 or 5 stars but the hotelIs unfortunately let down by a few small points that cumulatively lower the standard of the experience as a whole.The welcome was ok - but lacked warmth or sincerity. We asked about the possibility of a late checkout and were told that it is possible but at an additional charge of £10 per hour after the standard checkout of 10:30....when will London hotels realise that this is a significant opportunity? While we were at reception, two other guests enquired about late checkouts - and at typical inflated London prices, anyone with a decent business head should simply absorb the slight extra cost of keeping housekeeping onsite for a couple more hours and offer late checkouts - come on people, it’s a big selling point!The public spaces are fine - relatively recently refurbished, clean and pleasant.Our room (on the ‘lower-ground’ floor) was small but well-appointed, with plenty of options for charging phones and other modern necessities! The hairdryer was a good one (often overlooked in hotels) and the bed (mattress) was decent quality.The details around the room however were rather disappointing:We repeatedly stood on the sharp carpet strip between the bedroom and bathroom - as it had been exposed by the fraying of the carpet.There were a few damp patches in full view on the walls - which should have been cleaned off the wallpaper as soon as they occurred - as they are now a permanent feature.The ‘air conditioning’ is pretty much ineffectual - I tried varying it quite a lot while we were there, to no discernible effect.The tea/coffee selection is pitiful - and would have been barely acceptable ten years ago.The toilet seat didn’t match(fit) the bowl, and therefore moved constantly in use.The bathroom bin lid wasn’t attached and therefore flew off onto the floor every time we used the foot pedal at the base of the bin until we finally got used to it (when we checked out).The shower, on the other hand was fantastic - I will be buying one of these units for home very soon!So in summary - despite the hotel’s accessibility (like most places in London) and almost-reasonable price level, it lacks attention to detail and doesn’t quite feel as welcoming as it should.A missed opportunity - that can be easily rectified by the management team I would say.","March 18, 2018","6    The W14 Kensington

377,I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The bed is comfortable but note that the pressure from the shower isn't great. Also note there are no lifts but the staff were helpful with luggage. I found the rooms very loud with doors constantly banging.Breakfast was extremely poor in both choice and quality.The main reason I would never consider staying in this hotel again is because of what is have mentioned in the title. The person who cleaned my room used my lipstick. I found the attached tissue on the desk where I had left my make up. I am not someone who blots my lipstick in this way so therefore I can confidently say this was not left by myself. On finding the tissue I looked through my make up bad looking to match the colour and found the lipstick right at the bottom of my make up bag so who knows what else was used. I reported this to reception and was told to send an email. I returned to my room at the end of the day to find the remains of the cup of tea I had earlier still on the side.I sent an email to the manager as advised and received an extremely disappointing response where he claims the tissue was left by myself - even though I have made it clear it was not and also that the cup of tea was left there because they thought I was still using it. He is not prepared to look into the matter any further and so he clearly does not take it seriously that his staff cannot be trusted in the rooms not to invade peoples privacy. I asked for the lipstick to be replaced but he refused.If you do stay here I would put do not disturb on the door but really I would advise you not to.,"February 26, 2018","6    The W14 Kensington

But compared to an American hotel, it was small. You really don’t have anywhere to do anything but sleep and have your suitcase closed if you want to walk to the bathroom. But, they have a bottle of water and daily reception which was very nice. For the price and convenience, I would stay again. ","July 5, 2019","7    Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road

Was surprised to get a night in this place for £155 which in Central London is reasonable compared to other places nearby. Having said that it’s still a rip-off compared to the rest of the UK. Hotel is a modern office block conversation right in the bustling heart of Soho, and very handy for west end theatres etc. Modern well equipped room in a boutique style.

The hotel is strategically located in Central London (Zone 1) and making it extremely easy to navigate around all touristy sites and of course, convenient to shop around Oxford and Regent Streets.

Be sure to be there early to get a table as it gets packed quite easily.

Room was designed well, good quality linens, clean, compact but very well presented and added extra touches in room - drinks, cotton wool, buds, shower gel etc which you don't get with budget hotels normally.

Negative aspects: late check-in from 3 pm, the breakfast room is too small to get everyone seated, they forgot to clean our room even though our door hanger was hanging. When we came back in our room the next evening, we informed the girl at the reception and she assured that someone would bring towels, soap and water but actually nobody came.

If you're looking for a hotel for that kind of occasion, where you know you'll only be in there for a few hours just to sleep, then I would definitely recommend this one given it's price in comparison to most in this part of London.The rooms are tiny and dominated by the bed but the space works well - everything tucks away neatly. The bathroom is clean and modern with a great shower. Good set of amenities for a hotel of this style - various bits in the bathroom and a tray with a kettle and various teas and coffees.Staff at check-in and check-out were friendly and helpful. Special mention goes to the guy at reception when we arrived back at about 2am, somewhat inebriated, who helped us find somewhere nearby to get some late night food!All in all, definitely recommended for a short stay, especially if it's just one person.

The rooms are very clean and modern just no space for anything. Our room did not even have a closet and so it was extremely difficult to figure out where to put our clothes. The room contains the bare necessities and it was difficult coming from 5* hotels to go to not having a robe/slippers and hair dryer.

Well, they are indeed but come to think of it, since you'll be out most of the time, the only thing that you'll be needing is a bed to rest at the end of the day and your very own bathroom, right? Anyway, the room, albeit its size, is very clean, comfortable, modern-looking and automated. The utilization of space has been thoroughly thought of. It has coffee/tea making facilities, television, ac, h/c shower and basic toiletries. The bed is VERY nice. Did I mention that they have this wine and cheese buffet in the afternoon? It's located near Oxford Street (shopping!). There are also restaurants nearby and it's only a few minutes walk to the nearest tube. They can store your luggage if you still have places to go before you head out to the airport. Special shout-out to the very accommodating front desk personnel -- Pablo and Dominic.

The rooms were small, but did not feel cramped or too small for showering, getting ready and sleeping. The shower cubicle is extremely large, with good pressure and towels were provided. The TV at the end of the bed was huge and had the Sky channels and catch up channels all to watch for free! The bed was extremely comfortable with sufficient amounts of pillows for both of us. The room has air con with a fancy electric panel to control the lights and various things. The air con stayed on all night and we slept very well. The hotel is in and around Soho with lots of places to eat in a walking distance. Although outside the hotel was noisy as it was a Saturday evening, we heard no noise from our hotel room all night.We got off at Tottenham Court Road station and walked the 0.6 miles in around 10 minutes. However, upon leaving the hotel we realised Oxford Circus was the closest station to the hotel and did the walk in half the time - it was literally only two short roads and we were back!The staff were very friendly and couldn’t have done more to help. Although we only stayed the one night due to our show ending late in the evening, it was an comfortable nights sleep and the condiments tray had lots to enjoy.Thanks for having us we will be back again soon.","August 12, 2018","7    Z Hotel Tottenham Court Road

Lovely extra touches like toiletries, cheese and wine in the evenings and breakfast but don’t expect huge rooms, that’s why it’s cheaper than most but nice for what it is.

Excited to hear that they have complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings and breakfast in the morning!

Just make sure you are very comfortable with your travelling partner!! Huge smart TV in the room as well as tea and coffee facilities, USB ports, hairdryer- they really have thought of everything.

423,"Down in London for 3 days and because of Wimbledon, was unable to stay in the city. Westbridge is my go to for when I'm in Stratford so booked in here for the 2 nights.The room was pleasant enough, though not sure if it's only because I tried working in the hotel this time I noticed it's but the space between the desk and the bed makes it quite impractical to use (with ease). This was room 112.Amenities are still just as good, and it's the gym that truly makes this place shine over the other hotels.Ate in here for the first night as it was late and I'd been traveling/working all day. The menu has changed since the last time I was down, so got to try a few more delights.Opted for the confit duck to start, followed by the fillet steak (with a side salad), and finished with the triple chocolate cheesecake. All in very pleasant. It's a shame it's not licenced, but I can live with that.Breakfast is the same buffet style that I've come to know when in London. They don't appear to have takeaway cups in the dining room at breakfast so unable to grab and go (though I think you could ask the waiting staff).All staff are pleasant and overall it was a very enjoyable stay, and will remain my go-to place when in Stratford.","July 6, 2019","8    The Westbridge Hotel

424,"In looking for a place to stay the night, I loved the look of the hotel, but was convinced when I learnt it was fully halal. The hotel is well situated- only a few minutes walk from Stratford Station and Westfield. It has a garden and a beautiful lounge, a delicious breakfast buffet, and a room which is well considered in its amenities. The staff were really friendly, helpful and considerate. My husband surprised me by upgrading us to a suite and as each one is different (which I love) the staff really kindly showed me the available suites so I can choose which one I wanted to stay in. I chose the King Edward Suite as this was really spacious although faced the main road which wasn't really a problem. They provided us with a cot for my 2 year old daughter and brought up extra bedding and towels for her. The only only downfall is that the hotel does not have its own parking but there is parking nearby and a stay here is worth the trouble.","July 5, 2019","8    The Westbridge Hotel

The large balcony/terrace was a nice bonus. The Westbridge Hotel was close to public transportation, but a little far from the city of London (sightseeing areas), it was about a 25 min train ride. Our stay here was pleasant, the restaurant food was very good; however this is a 'dry' hotel so they do not serve any alcohol. It you want a drink with your meal or in your room, they do allow you to bring your own. From this hotel to London Heathrow airport it took about an hour and 15 mins by taxi and cost 78 pounds ($101).

The restaurant food is good although the menu is restrictive (especially formstays more than couple of days) and breakfast is turkey bacon not pork. The rooms although very modern lack space. The fancy electronic display air conditioning seems to make no difference what ever you set it too. I’ve stayed here for over a month so know this applies to all rooms. The biscuits in the room get replaced everyday but the water doesn’t, might do if you asked but shouldn’t have to. Some nice touches and great staff though.

Unfortunately, the shower had see through glass walls and anyone else in the room could see the person in shower which made it very difficult for us considering the age of our children. When we raised it with the hotel, we were initially advised that there is a button to make the shower walls opaque. There was no button and the hotel receptionist could not find either. Then we were told that the shower was made just like that. This meant that all the family had to move out of the room when one member was having shower. We requested for change of suite. The receptionist told it will be done but then we never heard back from them. We managed somehow although we could not understand the pathetic planning and purpose behind the showers.

The room size was excellent , very clean and the beds firm for comfortable. the front desk staff were friendly and very helpful. The bad points - ate at the restaurant both for breakfast and once for dinner. Breakfasts were not hot to start and went cold very fast. the dinner- service was dreadfully slow and the brought the wrong food out even though we pointed out on the very small menu exactly what we wanted as the description bad - 'vurger' for the vegan burger. Because both meals were brought out at same time one of us had to eat our meal alone or let it go cold whilst waiting for the correct meal to be brought for the other. We were offered no compensation for the mistake. The main issue in the room we had was the air cooling system. it did nothing but circulate the warm air in the room. Opening the window meant the noise from the outside was loud and the window wouldnt close properly without alot of force.","May 30, 2019","9    Novotel London Excel

487,"Unfortunately, I have had a bad experience at your Novotel in the Royal Victoria Dock.Ok, so before checking in, I called yourselves about my dietary requirements. I was informed by the person who answered the call after checking that you do provide halal chicken. I said to the gentleman on the phone, that if he could ring me back to DOUBLECHECK, that would be great. He replied that he would and took down my details. The next day, he called me and informed me that your hotel does provide Halal chicken, All of the chicken on ALL of the dishes that you serve is halal. So I was pleased to hear this.So on the 23rd, I came to check-in unfortunately I was unable to check in due to the pin on my card being entered incorrect. So I tried it 3 times and unfortunately it got blocked and declined. In the end my room was booked. however, I asked your reception staff whether I can still use the card in the bar or restaurant before I went to my room, he replied to me, that I would be able to use the card, because its using a different card reader/terminal station. (I didn't know what he meant by terminal station, so I apprehensively said 'oh..ok.'.I went to order a drink, believing what he said, and no surprise, the card got declined. So due to your colleague lying to me, I looked like a right idiot buying a drink and not being able to pay for it! So that really annoyed me.So after this I went to my room and OMG!! I was so disappointed in the quality of the room. it was soo small, very standard, had a horrible odour to it and the bath and showers looked like it was put in 40 years ago! The bed sheet had some marks on the bed, god knows what they were. I felt really uncomfortable and in the end I slept on the sofa bed. So a few things to complain about, but that wasn't the worst....I went to the restaurant later to get some dinner with my colleagues. I was keen to get some lovely chicken to eat. I was even saying to my colleagues that this restaurant is nice to cater to Muslims, especially in Ramadan (the time of month for fasting, 20 hours a day!) for his needs. So you had some great compliments coming from me, despite there was wrong information provided to me and the poor was is some serious low standards and poor hygiene. So the waiter came and asked me what me and my colleagues wanted to order, I ordered a salmon starter and a dish with chicken. At this point I thought I would DOUBLECHECK again. (This is the 3rd time I have checked at this point) Surprisingly, the waiter says, 'no sir, the chicken is not halal', I was confused, because I double checked this previously and told them, no you double check, i called the hotel a few days ago and they do provide halal chicken for ALL DISHES containing chicken. He went and checked in the kitchen and they told him, no only chicken on the pizza. this information was relayed back to me. I was confused.. I had checked with someone, they said its halal, I told them to doublecheck and call me back, he did and STILL said it is halal for ALL CHICKEN. I was soo annoyed with this. But I was with colleagues and I thought I would tell the general manager there and then, but I thought, no its ok. Order something else, something vegetarian. So I told the waiter, 'Ok, Since the chicken is not halal, could I have a vegan burger, he confirmed this and later on..he bought me a beef burger with BACON!! Now, not only is this order wrong, but he brought me some meat which is not halal, but he bought me a burger with bacon. I am not sure if you are aware of Muslims and the importance of avoiding pork. This piece of bacon was put right in front of me, whist I was about to break my fast. I couldn't believe the staff getting the order soo wrong and offended me soo much. You might as well have bought me coke and put wine in its place!! So all in all, a horrible and terrible experience with Novatel.What is your company going to do about this?Dishonest and not loyal, poor communication with colleagues, what happened to me could happen to anyone else.","May 29, 2019","9    Novotel London Excel

502,"Would I have chosen to stay here if I was visiting London for the weekend? No. However, if you are attending the Excel for a conference or concert, then look no further, the hotels location is perfect.The hotel itself is nice. It's clean and tidy and well appointed. However, if you are driving to the hotel, please be careful in the carpark as it's the most dangerous car park I have ever been in, in terms of space. Just to give you an idea, we had to fold our mirrors in just to get through the barrier and our car is a standard size. The scrapes and marks on the walls will show you where to be cautious.The room again was clean and tidy and well appointed and came with a bath (although not full size) and a walk in shower. The only thing missing from the bathroom was the toilet! This was tucked away in a separate room right next to the front door. This to be honest was a pain. They would be better off ditching the small bath and replacing it with a toilet. I know it doesn't sound much but when it's dark early in the morning and you have to trapes to the front door to find the toilet, then when you find it you have to squeeze your way in as it's that small, it can become a chore.That said, the room came with a kettle, minibar (payable), iron and ironing board, hairdryer and small TV. One good touch was there were USB charging points next to the bed, which was a bonus. One thing that did annoy me was the temperature of the room. It was just too hot. The aircon didn't work and the window only opened slightly for safety reasons. To be honest, I could not get a good night sleep for that reason and ended up clock watching all night.Breakfast was included in the rate and it was perfect. The restaurant was clean and tables were plentiful. The food was excellent and some of the dishes could be made to order. No complaints there at all.Would I stay here when visiting the excel again? Given that's it's a 5 minute walk away, maybe so. However, I did have a better experience staying at the Hilton last year, which was a 15 minute walk away, so maybe not.","April 6, 2019","9    Novotel London Excel

I was in contact with the hotel to explain that I had a few things planned and needed the staff help to pull it off and WOW!!!! They went beyond the extra mile. I booked a Superior Queen Room and they upgraded our room to a Suite without my knowledge until I checked in. We have entered the room and they have made a love heart using some rose petals on the bed as well as 2 love swans. I had a bouquet of flowers delivered to hotel earlier and I had arranged when we went out that the hotel set up the room with the flowers and rose petals that I supplied them. On returning to the suite my Partner was amazed wowed and gobsmacked (very rare) with the amazing job that they did and they also did us complimentary Prosecco and a Happy Anniversary Cake. Sarah was the main part of this amazing night she has gone miles past the extra mile, but I would like to say a massive thank you to ALL the hotel staff and I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone.

The hotel is well connected to the Docklands Light Railway and extremely close to the western entrance of London Excel; it was only a short (and inexpensive) trip round to the airport in the morning on the DLR.My room was booked with a third party (via a 'secret rate', which offered a slight discount off the hotel's own rate) and whilst I appreciate that no points are payable on such a rate, it is a shame that points are also not provided for incidental spend (e.g. in the bar).The room itself was in very good condition and well laid out, with a comfortable bed - perfectly suitable for a single night stay. Food in the bar was good quality and reasonable value, although I would prefer to see some more standard tables/chairs as well as the less formal seating. There is a terrace with a fine view of the river and the O2, although it was a little cold to stay out there too long this time.

The person continued to give me an attitude because they were unable to provide a rate and claimed he was looking into it. However he actually transferred me to a central reservations team who did not answer the line , and the cal bounced back to him . For this reason he was rude and unapologetic for his tone and manner. When I asked whether an early check in would be possible he seemed uninterested in helping and finished off by telling me that there is nothing more he can do , and was incredibly rude unfriendly and inexperienced.

The location was perfect, situated right next to the Sunborn London, floating hotel! Beautiful boat. You can go in for drinks in the main bar and stand outside on its deck to take pics. But back to the Novotel hotel! The bar was great, service was spot on, we ordered food (see pictures) a lot. The young lady and the bar manager/supervisor (Male short guy didn’t get his name) were so lovely, making an effort to chat to us! Nice touch! The bar food was amazing. We had the chicken wings and nachos. For just bar food it was good! Prices were standard for London! The room was nice and adequate! Seperate toilet by the front door and bath and shower inside the room! It was perfect for our short stay. The Car park was based under the hotel and for 3 days 2 nights we were charged £16. I was impressed with that, I assume we were not charged for a Bank holiday! All in all great stay. There is a local Nisa and Tesco Express a 1 min walk away! This place had all that we needed!

527,"This was quite a disappointment. We chose this Accor hotel because I am an A Club member and wanted to take my wife to London for her birthday. It is a fairly modern building and in a good location if you are going to the O2 as we were.I booked direct and asked a question at that time.No response.Later I emailed directly after my wife had an operation on her foot which meant we had to drive there.There was a delay of a day or two before I got a reply. They confirmed that there was parking and said we could have it for only £8 a day. They also said they would upgrade our room and it would be nearer the lift so my wife had less distance to walk.Very kind.We arrived and drove into the ground level car park and up a level. There was plenty of room but I was glad my car was not larger- the exit in particular is VERY narrow.We went to check in. Oddly there is a lift from the ground floor and mezzanine to the Reception which is on the second floor. You then catch a completely separate lift to your room. Not particularly convenient with luggage or if you have mobility issues.We were given Room 539. If it was an upgrade then the standard rooms can't be too impressive.It was not near the lifts. It was an OK room- as good as a Travelodge or Premier Inn. The view was nice. Good wardrobe and storage space. Mini fridge with free water. Desk and a smallish TV with limited channels. No details of the hotel and facilities to speak of.Comfy bedThe toilet was separate from the bathroom. And small. The bathroom was also small- a walk in shower and small sink. Not much room to put your toiletries.Free wi fi and a USB socket by the headboard.We didn't have breakfast there but had an unremarkable evening meal at the Upper Deck. I was glad I kept my jacket on as it was cold by the window. Service was casual and not really attentive.The worst example of the poor quality attitude from the staff came when I went to pay for parking. Three staff were on Reception - one was dealing with a couple checking in. The other two were studiously looking at their computer screens ignoring me.Another guest then arrived and went up to one of the Receptionists who duly served him, ignoring the fact I had been waiting.When I did get served I was asked if I had stayed at the hotel. I had to show her the email offering parking at half price.It took quite a while for her to validate my parking ticket and to pay (no contactless here) and then she told me that the pass was valid for only 10 minutes!Given my wife's mobility problem and getting our luggage to the car plus setting up the sat nav this was hardly up to standard.On the plus side my wife did get a free birthday cake after we arrived.Would I stay there again? Because of the poor quality of the staff: no. Urgent need for training in customer care here. Other hotels exist in the area.","December 16, 2018","9    Novotel London Excel

A gem in this class of hotel, a great value, and I would return on my next London visit.","June 27, 2019","10    Montana Hotel

534,"We arrived about 2pm on a Monday. As everything had been paid in advance, check in took a matter of minutes. We were given a room in the basement, accessible via stairs off the bar. The room had two twin beds, a desk and bureau, small refrigerator, closet, TV, and a bathroom with full bathtub and shower and large medical cabinet. It was incredibly spacious by London standards. Of course, not all was glorious: the room was very warm and humid even with air conditioning cranked as low as it could go, and our window view looked upon a nasty-looking cement drainage basin between buildings. I kept the curtains closed. A minor issue, all considered, but worth noting.The room was nice and quiet. Few rooms were along that hallway so there was little foot traffic, and no street traffic near us at all. I actually slept pretty well.Everything in the bathroom worked without issue. We loved having a fridge in our room--there's a great Waitrose right across the nearest intersection, which made it easy to stash food and drinks in our room! The front desk staff was very pleasant whenever we passed through. Room service did a good job whenever they came by each day.The breakfast buffet was included with our room package. The best way to describe it is ""meh,"" as it largely consisted of generic, made-long-in-advance foods like you'd find at a cheap motel chain breakfast buffet in the US. The only stand-out was the strawberries, which were fresh and fantastic. The staff there was nice and eager to help, but the mediocre food just didn't make it worthwhile to utilize again.The hotel's location is absolutely fantastic. It's just across the street from the Gloucester Road tube station. This was an easy connection point into the city, and on the direct Piccadilly line to Heathrow. Within walking distance are numerous restaurants of various ethnicities and price points, plus several great museums. We enjoyed the short walk up to Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. The neighborhood felt very safe.","June 26, 2019","10    Montana Hotel

535,"Good, clean, basic room with excellent front desk staff and location. Stayed three nights recently. You will get a basic room in a converted townhouse. Since it is not a purpose-built hotel, it has its design quirks. For the price I did not expect luxury accommodations. The room was clean and served the purpose. What really was important was the location. You can practically see the hotel from the Gloucester Road tube station entrance (on the Piccadilly line with direct access from Heathrow) and that is a major plus from my perspective when traveling with luggage -- no taxi necessary. Finally, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful with what seemed like a genuine interest in helping me and my family enjoy our stay in London -- another major plus in this price range. Would stay here again.","June 23, 2019","10    Montana Hotel

536,"Stayed at this great Hotel for 5 days in May 2019. Fabulous Location in Kensington. The Hotel is a 3 minute walk to Gloucester Road Metro, which is on the Piccadilly Line which is a direct line from Heathrow Airport. Very Convenient !!! Bus stop 3 minutes walk away which will take you to a miriad of locations if you prefer overground transport. Excellent eateries in immediate area including Pret A Menger, Starbucks, and 2 great English Pubs. We did not eat in the Hotel Restaurant as we do not do ‘big English breakfasts’ and even though the dinner menu looked very interesting it was Indian cuisine which is not to our taste. The room was excellent. As with most accommodation in London the room was not oversized however it had everything you need. Most importantly for us it had a fridge, safe, tea making and very good WiFi and room to store our luggage. Very clean room and fabulous reception staff. The Hotel did have a LIFT - small but an absolute must for us. Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.","June 5, 2019","10    Montana Hotel

537,"I stayed at this hotel twice last year, in July and again in October. The second time, the receptionists recognised me, which was really amazing, seeing they have so many customers. I was recognised again when I stayed with them a few weeks ago. Not only that, but they upgraded me from a room with a shared bathroom to one with en suite. In addition, at first, both in October last year and this again year, they didn't think they had two rooms available for me and the other member of my party for the full time I wanted to stay, but they juggled things around so that we were able to stay there for the whole time (five nights last October, four nights in May.) I can't fault the service, the comfort of the beds, the cleanliness of the hotel, and. of course, the location, which is wonderful. I was given a great deal with the price, better than my travel agent was able to get, perhaps because I rang the hotel direct, I'm not sure, All in all, a great place to stay.","May 31, 2019","10    Montana Hotel

542,"We spent four nights in April here and were extremely pleased with the hotel. Decorated in deep reds and gold, and with crystal lighting fixtures and deep mouldings in common spaces, the hotel has a charming, old world vibe. We asked for a quiet room and were delighted with a spacious family room at the back of the hotel - no view, but then we were in the room only to rest and sleep and the quiet room afforded that! As the building is older, rooms do vary considerably, so contact the hotel directly if you have specific requirements or needs. We were well satisfied with cleanliness. We loved the free loaner phone, which allowed us to navigate London streets without draining the battery on our personal mobiles. Staff was uniformly helpful and friendly, but a special call-out goes to Iliana who set the bar high for exceptional customer service! Our room had adequate television, a nice kettle with coffee and tea service, a small mini fridge (great for families!), a table with chairs, and a safe in the armoire. We used the 15% discount in the Indian restaurant on the premises and thought the meal good. Breakfast was probably the only dent in the stay. It was perfectly adequate, but there is an upcharge of £2 per person for full English. I asked if I could pay the charge and get just eggs with continental toast, fruit, and yogurt and was told no. Quality of the continental spread was average. The hotel is just a minute from the tube, a Waitrose grocery store, and the wonderful French bakery chain Paul, and there are many restaurant options nearby. It’s a ten minute walk max to V&A and not much longer to Kensington Gardens and Prince Albert Hall. If coming from Heathrow, you can stay on the Piccadilly tube line the entire way. All in all, we felt this hotel has the best location of anywhere we’ve ever stayed in London. We’ll be back!","May 1, 2019","10    Montana Hotel

On my most recent stay, I arrived at the hotel in the early hours of the morning, coming straight from a very long flight from Australia, feeling very tired and in need of a shower. They were kind enough to allow me to have a shower while I waited for my room to become available. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, along with grocery stores, a travel information centre across the street, laundry facilities just down the road and the Gloucester Road tube station less than two minutes from the hotel.

They organised tickets for the Original Bus Tour which the stop was literally outside the hotel. The tube station is a stones throw away from the hotel too. Plenty of cafes, restaurants, supermarkets with within walking distance also. When we got back to hotel out rooms had been upgraded which was a lovely surprise. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. It was a little bit noise as our room was facing the street but I'm not a great sleeper in hotels. The hotel offered breakfast but we chose to go to a cafe down the street. The hotel bar and lobby is lovely and quaint. Not too big and has a small bar. We ate in the hotels Indian restaurant which was really lovely and would definitely recommend it. In the rooms was a phone which you could take out with around London and you could find places to visit, book tickets, restaurants cafes etc. It's a great idea but unfortunately nobody told us about it and it wasn't until the last day that we discovered this.

The room is beautiful, large and spacious with a great bathroom, nice big TV and a great view of the historic church just across the road.

The gentleman at reception was extremely courteous, helpful and professional.He took our luggage to our room which was greatly appreciated and then proceeded to give us all the information about our room, the hotel and the surrounding area; he could not have been more friendly. The level of service provided by him and all other staff during our stay was excellent.Our room was on the ground floor just behind reception and we were completely satisfied with it, It was cosy and spotless and suited all our needs. There was a small refrigerator for our use, tea and coffee making facilities, television and a courtesy smart phone for free calls if needed during the stay. Maps of London and places of interest were also provided. The shower room was small but perfectly adequate and spotless. Plenty of white towels were provided. The room contained a double bed and a single bed (we obviously only needed the double bed which was comfortable) and had enough space for our needs. There was plenty of drawer space and clothes hanging space. We did not have an evening meal at the adjoining restaurant but did have the continental breakfast the following morning which was perfectly adequate. The staff at breakfast were attentive, friendly and efficient. Our morning toast was brought to us and our coffee topped up regularly. The staff really should be congratulated on the level of service they provided. The Montana really should be proud of the level of service provided during our stay. The location of the Montana is excellent. Close by is Gloucester Road tube station) literally you cross two roads and you are there) and there are also bus stops even closer.

We didn't have a big room but was fine for a short stay and it had three beds so we didn't need to share. Our room was at the front and had some traffic noise but the hotel is on a busy road so we expected that. Beds were comfortable (strange to go back to blankets - not as comfy as a duvet) and there were spare pillows, etc. There was a simple selection of toiletries in the bathroom but we used our own and there were plenty of clean, white, fluffy towels. We had an ironing board but there wasn't a lot of hanging space in the wardrobe because of the ""extras"" stored there. As it was a mid-priced hotel, we thought it was good value for money, not luxury but a comfortable room.Breakfast was a good continental and you could opt for a ""full English"" if you wanted. There were lots of staff to make service quick and easy. Staff brought toast and hot drinks and you could help yourself to the food. Being picky, Croissants could have been the fresh, flaky ones from a bakery (or the kitchen) but were OK and there was plenty of other choice so no complaints. Staff were very attentive to my grand-daughter, too. (I do miss marmite in many hotels - love it on toast!)We felt safe and happy staying at this clean and comfortable hotel. That was all that we needed for this particular trip so would happily recommend the Montana to other visitors.","October 27, 2018","10    Montana Hotel

The bed was super comfy and the room (309) and bathroom were clean. They even provide a free data iphone for tourists staying here. The underground Gloucester Road station is practically across the road so this is very convenient. The receptionists are well-trained and polite. I was particularly impressed with the Italian lady at the front counter that helped me with a printing document. These are services that will make guests feel valuable and pleasant that sadly most hotels these days are lacking. Despite Montana labelled themself as a 3 star budget, this Indian-inspired hotel is a worthy 4 star in my books. My only regret is i did not stay longer. If you don’t stay here, it is your loss!

The neighborhood is safe to walk after dark with children, and there are numerous restaurants within easy walking distance. I recommend Pizza Express next door, and Raison d’Etra which is just a 5-8 minute easy walk away. Our room was on the top floor, so we appreciated the lift. The lift is tiny, so our party of 4 with luggage took 4 trips! The room was elegant and comfortable. Obviously updated and well maintained. The en suite was small but excellent quality. There is another full toilet and shower just down the hall, if a 2nd person in your room is in urgent need of the toilet! That one has a window, which is much appreciated. Leave your key at reception when leaving for the day’s adventuring. I’m a knitter, so I left small handmade gifts for the service staff along with the usual gratuity.

Really high spec bath room and quite spacious room. Plenty of storage for clothes and the thing all three of us quickly pointed out was not only was it clean but immaculate! It looked quite recently decorated. We had tea/coffee making supplies along with a hairdryer. We had to go back to the main house for breakfast which had a decent selection of food to choose from.

586,"I deliberately chose to stay in a more residential area outside of central London. Decent transport options. Pretty easy from the airport on the Piccadilly and Jubilee lines (although steps at West Hampstead station) and easy to get to Hampstead Heath. As well as the tube, there are also buses that head into the touristy central London area via Abbey Road which is a scenic trip. There's a Tesco nearby on the main street.The house is actually several managed properties spread out on several streets. Stayed in a single room in a building down the street from the main house. Had kettle/tea/coffee, hairdryer and TV although no bodywash/shampoo/conditioner (luckily I always bring my own). There was also no in-room safe, and my room was in the basement level which was a bit unsettling when I first saw it. The stairs down were pitch black at first until I realised the light automatically turns on when you head down the stairs. The room had a window that faced the next-door building under construction. Small, as are most places in the UK, and was a bit old and had dated furniture. But fairly clean and was comfortable. Selection of hot food and cereals at breakfast which was in a nice (but extremely warm) breakfast room. Never had a problem getting a seat. WiFi worked fine.5GBP deposit when checking in which you get back when you return the key. Friendly service. Overall this was a decent stay for two nights and good value for money.","June 6, 2019","11    Charlotte Guest House

587,"When we arrived at the guest house, it was as we expected from the picture. However after checking in we were marched back out the front door, down the road, across the road and up another road to another property which apparently they own too. Then we were told they had approximately 5 properties in the area.When they showed us to our room ours was on the ground floor whereas out daughter was put on the top floor, three floors up. Our room was clean and had a new bathroom, but unfortunately is was very poorly lit, there was no dressing table or hair dryer, but most of all the furniture and bedding although they were clean, they were very old and outdated. When we looked outside out window all we saw was a brick wall, which was the side passage!When we checked our daughter's room, although it was brighter, it was like going back to the 50's and that is how old the furniture was and the bathroom was awfully worn out, having to prop the shower head against the wall to even have a shower.We also had a very noisy evening with other guests going in and out of their rooms all night long, and to finish off having to walk two streets with our bags to go and have our breakfast and then check out, which is not what we had expected at all!!

I'm gullible enough to have been coming here for seven years, but I don't feel I can carry on taking the risk of getting a horrible room and a totally shameless response from stroppy desk staff with bad attitudes. All they actually care about is your money. They don't care about breaking promises. They don't care about messing you around. They don't care about ruining your holiday. Basically they don't care.

Comfy accommodations and really reasonable rates.CONS: We arrived after checkin time, but our room still wasn't ready. That was frustrating as we'd had a really long day and really long flight. We had to walk around the neighborhood for a couple hours.

Reason for giving 4 stars instead of five -Lighting in the room wasn't great (putting on make-up was very difficult!) Maybe put a brighter light over the dressing table and/or in the bathroom. The door just outside our bedroom had a very strong spring, and so was a bit noisy as it slams every time anyone went through it.Major plus points - The location is very good, a few minutes from the tube and overground. Staff helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble, all very clean. We had a good breakfast, coffee refills and nobody rushed us out so it was very relaxing.

Next was the food. I cannot explain how much I love the food. I go down and the dining area was almost always full because they didn’t just offer cereal and juice, they gave you meats and eggs and more!

611,"I came to stay at The Charlotte on the 6th Jan for 1 night with my daughter and grand daughter,we arrived early and was greeted by the lovely lady on reception who told us that our room was ready, it was in the building straight opposite. The room was on the ground floor, clean, nice size ( with a double and single bed) and a lovely little en-suite. We were going to the theatre later that day and the taxi was arranged by the lady on reception, the same company picked us up and took us back to the guest house. On Sunday we went to breakfast which was in the main building opposite, the breakfast area was very busy and a little cramped but again the staff were friendly and cheerful. The cooked breakfast was really nice and plentiful, I would definitely stay here again, its very good value for money, the staff are friendly and helpful and rooms are a good size and clean. On leaving the Charlotte we were going to visit Camdem and was told by the lady on reception that we could leave our luggage there and collect it later!

Although the furniture and decor was dated, it was a comfortable stay for the night.

The breakfast also fantastic with a great range of things to choose from to start your day. A fantastic location, too: a few minutes walk to the tube station, and plenty of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. I'd highly recommended the Railway Pub, which is around 5 minutes walk away. Excellent food and ales, and music fans may be interested to know that Cream, Hendrix and the Stones all played there.","December 7, 2017","11    Charlotte Guest House

615,"I was in London on my own for one night and so I wasn't too particular as regards accommodation - all I needed was somewhere to sleep that was convenient to the centre and good value. What could I expect for £57? Not much, I thought. I was pleasantly surprised.I was assigned Room A at 165 Sumatra Road (a few hundred yards away from the main house - the nice girl at reception walked with me there and made sure I knew the layout). As expected (and as indicated when booking) it was small but perfectly adequate. It was a cold night in London but the room was nice and warm.The bed was comfortable, the room was spotlessly clean and the en-suite shower/toilet very convenient (some other rooms have shared bathroom facilities). Noise-wise, the rumble of trains from the nearby station was obvious until about 11pm or so but thereafter, until 6:30am, it was silence. Neither could I hear any of my neighbours or traffic ( the house is on a quiet road). It made for a perfect night's sleep.Breakfast was at the main house and there was a good choice - Full English, scrambled or poached eggs, or Continental plus the usual juices and cereals. All the hot food was freshly made to order. My scrambled eggs and coffee were perfect.All in all, ideal accommodation for the budget-conscious traveler and it will be my first choice for my occasional visits to London from now on. The area is safe and there are good pubs and restaurants in the vicinity (I recommend the Railway Bar which has excellent food). West Hampstead Tube Station is only a few minutes walk away and so very convenient for getting into town.","November 22, 2017","11    Charlotte Guest House

618,"This property is unique. Basically two old Victorian terraces made into a hotel. Note what I’ve said there. They haven’t knocked through they give you a key and you can be asked to leave and go next door. Odd.The hotel is off the main area for trendy bars and near the tube line so location is good. The area can be a little imposing at night. Remember you are surrounded by faceless predominantly bed sits and flats. The street isn’t particularly clean.So our visit started off meeting the receptionist who was professional and polite. She got us a cab sorted.We had to leave the reception out of the door and into next door. The stairs had stairs going down to a very dingy looking basement flat area not very inviting. We were first floor. The hotel seems like beds it land I guess it probably was. We laughed when we opened the door. It was like being transported back in time. 1960-70 era furniture. Yes it was clean but not exactly modern. The bed felt soft. Compact and bijou is the ideal terminology.The TV is minuscule more like a computer monitor high up on the wall. Worked ok but for this age poor. Wi if was acceptable.The bathroom was very modern and of a good standard although there was an odd smell. There is no shower gel provided and two thin towels. I noted that the outside of the basin had toothpaste residue on it. Two beakers were provided.We went out most of the night. You are given two keys, one for the front door. It was quiet when we returned at midnight.We had a terrible nights sleep. The mattress is sub standard. I literally was touching the bed frame when lying down. We missed the sign saying we could ask for extra pillows. Boy did we need them. We ended up using two lumpy decorative pillows as well as the well used ones provided. We were constantly waking up in agony. We both have low back pain today. This is not the place for a romantic interlude. We both said a park bench would’ve given us a better sleep.Noise from the underground is minimal.This is written pre breakfast. Why ? Because I can’t get back to sleep. And on the day when the clocks went back, another hour in here. The bedroom was warm, there are tea and coffee making facilities.Overall impression. If you are on a budget use it. No more than a night. If not don’t buy the last round upgrade somewhere else. Lastly if booking with booking dot com book and then check prices a few days before coming. We did this cancelled and rebooked saving £16. ","October 29, 2017","11    Charlotte Guest House

We stayed in a private bathroom suite, which was small (room for a bed, dresser, and shower/toilet), but it was all that we needed. We were gone during the day, and just needed a bed to sleep in at night. The buildings are old, and have thin walls, but they are charming. The breakfasts were delicious!

622,"Charlotte Guest House, is an ideal location for short stays in London. I regularly visit during the week when I'm in the city for work, and am yet to have a bad experience. Situated on Sumatra Road in the affluent area of West Hampstead, it is only a short walking distance away from an array of bars and restaurants, as well as West Hampstead Underground, Overground, and Thameslink stations. There are also frequent bus services from the adjoining B510 road. This renders it a great location for travelling to virtually any part of London. The rooms are basic, but well maintained and clean. All benefit from a TV, tea/coffee making facilities, wash hand basin, and either an ensuite or shared bathroom. Rooms with the latter can be as cheap as £43, so if you're looking to save money on your trip and have no problem sharing, this would be ideal as you're not likely to find anywhere else this good, for this price in London. All guests benefit from a complimentary breakfast, served in the dining area next to the reception. A decent selection of food and drink is available, and is served by polite and diligent staff, who work very hard to ensure that you enjoy your stay. It's easy to make a reservation on their website; so if you're planning a trip to London, I'd strongly recommend you consider this place. ","September 20, 2017","11    Charlotte Guest House

624,"I stayed here five nights and got an amazing deal on the room. The location was perfect – West Hempstead – a few blocks walk to the Underground, Overground, and Thameslink. There are great bus services nearby but I didn’t use them as the trains were sufficient. There’s a Laundromat a few blocks away on the high street should you need to do laundry. Reception was super friendly and accommodating. My room was cozy and clean, with a kettle, a television, and a sink. I booked the single, so it was a twin bed, and although the room was on the small side, I didn’t feel cramped. I was on the top floor, which wasn’t a problem either, but since there’s no elevator, if you cannot do stairs I would speak with the hotel beforehand to see if you can be placed on a lower floor. I had no issues with the Wi-Fi, nor with the television in the room. The bathrooms are shared and they are kept clean, but bring your own toiletries. I don’t know why others are complaining on here about the key deposit, but yeah, you have to leave a £5 deposit, which isn’t the worst thing in the world and you get it back at the end of your stay, but I digress. I stayed in one of the houses directly across the street from reception. Just so you know, Charlotte Guest House is more of a B&B type of establishment and is made up of several houses on the street. You’ll breakfast in the main reception house. The breakfast was perfect, with many hot and cold choices on offer. The breakfast room is small so it gets crowded and can be chaotic, but that is to be expected when you're all clamoring to eat at the same time in the morning. London is so expensive, but Charlotte Guest House was an excellent value for the money.","August 29, 2017","11    Charlotte Guest House

I liked the made to order breakfast in the conservatory. An as-advertised pleasant simple guest house. Restaurants, bars, cafes, grocery stores, everything... plus train, tube, and bus, just around the corner. What more could you ask for at this price?

626,"We spent three days at the Charlotte Guest House. The property is spread over a number of adjacent buildings so we had to walk along Sumatra Road to the main premises for breakfast. Breakfast was ok but not memorable. Dining room felt cramped.Anna was helpful on our arrival and made us welcome. Our room up a steep flight of stairs was fairly compact with our two suitcases. However, the room and the small bathroom were clean. The room was serviced daily to a good standard.For us the room was just somewhere to sleep as we spent most of our time out and about. It wasn't a place I wanted to linger in during the day.The property is handy to underground stations and there are a number of eating places in the neighbourhood as well as a couple of handy supermarkets.Overall, the Charlotte isnt a top of the range property and what you get is a reflection of the price you pay in the London market.","August 4, 2017","11    Charlotte Guest House

This was clean and pleasant, with a great AC system working well.Breakfast was fine - not a big breakfast eater, but fresh fruit was just right - lots of places have unripe fruit, meaning no chance of breakfast. Again, not the case here.Checkout was great - even offered to call a cab to my destination as the other hotel's booking that they'd promised me from the night before was more than 15 minutes late for my meeting.Suffice to say, when I need to be in the Wembley area again, I'll be staying here!","July 12, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

643,"Top to Bottom our favourite London hotel. Seventh floor view of Gypsy Corner, fourth floor roof terrace looking towards central London and brilliant bar, lounge and restaurant facilities on the ground floor. Choice of excellent coffee, beer and cold drinks. Snacks and meals to suit the time of day. 24 hour cafe for the overnighters and late arrivals. My son has mobility issues and the staff led by Tom Storup, the reception manager went beyond expectations to meet his unique needs.","June 27, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

644,"I have been using this hotel as a base for my commute into central London for work, and its great!This hotel is easily reached by car & has parking, The central tube line a less than a 5min walk, with Oxford Circus only around 25mins away. The hotel itself is modern and spacious with a good sized bar/lounge area & adequate dinning area.Rooms are as expected with Holiday Inn hotels, clean, comfortable beds & pillows and always great powerful showers. On my most recent trip, I was lucky enough to have been given an upgrade, which was really nice. The room was much larger, with a good sized lounge area, great bed & TV at the foot of the bed-a real luxury! Staff at this hotel are also great, nothing is too much trouble, always happy to help and assist & always with a smile. If you are in need of an affordable hotel, with good access into central London, then I would recommend staying here.","June 25, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

645,"I don’t normally leave reviews as stay in a lot of hotels for work. However I feel compelled to leave a review on my recent stays at Holiday Inn, London West. All staff are very friendly, efficient, and clearly confident in their roles. This can only be due to strong management who know how to get the best out of their people. It makes such a difference. I love staying there, the hotel has a great atmosphere. The food is great, a decent choice of beers and wines. The hotel is just great value, near the tube for London and very popular with good reason. Always clean, well looked after. If you stay here you will feel that it exceeds expectations.","June 24, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

646,"We stayed here to go to a concert at Wembley as it was advertised as being near so all good. Checkin was ridiculously slow. Only 2 desks open, and one of them manned by a member of staff who was in training so the queues were ridiculous especially on a Sat afternoon when a bus party arrived .Its not a great first impression. We had a disabled executive room which we were very pleased with. Great bed, pillow choice and toiletries along with the disabled bathroom made it much easier to stay in with my disabilities.Location, There are not many nice food places nearby as it’s just off the A40. However the food in the restaurant was fine for a quick bite before the concert. Bit overpriced but it is “ London “ Breakfast ; very good range and quality to suit most tastes. Bar staff again were slow and seemed too inexperienced to be left on their own to cope with a bar. ordering 4 simple drinks the barman scuttled off , having had to write it down then took 5 mins to make them. Uber to Wembley cost £16 but allow lots of time for traffic, a 3 mile journey took 40 mins obviously due to increased concert traffic. Checkout was as painful as checkin , and staff were confused and tried to charge us for “parking and breakfast” £40 that we had already paid for when I’d checked in the day before. Again not impressed and staff in training. Overall. Good hotel , however staff really let it down. Advice - train your staff on non peak times and have them shadowed/ supported individually.","June 24, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

650,"The hotel is located centrally and convenient for people driving in to London. The hotel is quite modern in its decor. The Rooms and bath are good sized, modern interiors and comfortable. The breakfast spread is excellent and very well made. However, the breakfast area is quite cramped with tables laid out very very close to each other; and can be a bit too close for comfort, especially during busy hours. It has a very basic mini gym; but a swimming pool would have really enhanced the experience.

653,"We booked 2 rooms. Rooms are clean. Beds are comfy. Wonderful breakfast. Easy access ( 10 minutes walk )to London tube ( train station). All the employees are friendly and helpful. Especially receptionist, Francisca, Zanett, Ana , Seymour & Daniela ( pardon me if I spell any of the name incorrectly). On the 1st day, hotel was full & we didn’t get our rooms on the same level. But on the 2nd day morning I came down to the reception desk around 9 am talked to receptionist Francisca to get our rooms on the same level and I was told they’ll try their best because hotel is pretty full . But she asked me to pack our luggage and leave it ready so that they can move once any rooms available on same floor. I honestly didn’t have high expectation to get new rooms on same floor since the hotel was busy as well as all the employees. However, Francisca and her team got it done my request before noon and switched to 2 new rooms on the same floor even though they were busy. Employees from Holiday inn London West 4 Portal Way , Acton are really awesome and amazing. Francisca and above team members do really take care of their customers.

If there has been a slight blip (On first stay the tv did not work we were moved rooms immediately without question) it has been resolved quickly and with good humour. Strangers at first to the area the desk staff went out of their way to help us find appropriate transport and explained how paying on London transport works.

658,"Booked Acton since the Wembley hotel was well overpriced for the FA cup final night.I was very pleasantly surprised. Check in was very friendly and we were able to check in very early. We were given drinks vouchers due to our membership without having to ask.Our room was on the 7th floor. Nice, clean and airy with a lovely view of London! Good amenities too. We had none of the noise issues I’ve read about.I was disappointed with the GF options at dinner. I was given a sheet with the only options available the sauces, mixed vegetables, fruit salad or vegetable chilli. I asked the waiter why I couldn’t have a steak and baked potato but he said they had to be fried. Didn’t understand so I settled with a fruit salad. There are notices around about asking but I don’t think the staff are trained.Ilona looked after us at the bar and breakfast the following morning. She really is a lovely helpful member of staff and I hope you recognise her for me.Breakfast was better than Wembley by far. GF bread was brought promptly and there was plenty of options I could eat.If dinner had been better I would have given 5* but this should be worked on please!

We didn’t eat in the restaurant as we were going out to meet friends in London, but I’ve had a meal in the restaurant before and it was good food. The breakfast in the morning was also very good, with plenty of options from a full English to a continental breakfast and lots of fresh fruit and cereals.Transport links are plentiful too with North Acton tube station a 5 min walk from the the hotel which will take you straight into central London or you can walk to Acton Mainline Railway station and take a train into London Paddington or you could go west to towards Slough and Reading.Overall a great stay and will definitely be staying there again on my next visit to London .Great staff and service, thank you and see you soon.","March 29, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

683,"Booked this hotel because I couldn't get one nearer central London at a reasonable price. Actually, really pleased I went to this hotel rather than a central London one. This hotel is on the tube, at North Acton. About 7 minutes walk from the tube station. On the walk there's a Sainsbury's Local and Tesco Express if, like me, you needed to get something to eat. I arrived at the hotel between 8pm and 9pm and many were in the hotel restaurant. If you don't want to eat there, nor something from one of the supermarkets nearby, there's a huge Macdonald's across the road from the hotel.On arrival at the hotel, the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful if they'd tried. They even offered me a Kit Kat choc bar, as I must have seemed very tired from that day's work and travel.My room was big. If I was into cruelty, it was more than big enough to swing a cat. The room and bathroom was clean. In the bathroom there was a wet room shower, which was great. I was on the 1st floor, the same floor at the meeting/conference rooms and executive suites, it was quiet all night.The big double bed had clean bedding and was very comfy.Breakfast was included. It was a help yourself type. All the usual choices.The down side of staying at this hotel? The fact that I was only staying one night!","March 3, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

685,We were using the hotel conference rooms and also staying. We have been traveling during our sales season all over the country for the last 4 weeks and stayed at many different hotels however this one really exceeded our expectations for customer service. From the minute we arrived the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We had a van to unload and although car park gets quite busy we were able to unload easily into the 1st floor conference room mayfair. The room was ready for us and cleaned daily during the stay with water and cups etc refreshed without having to ask and any member of staff we met be it from house keeping to reception always smilled and greeted us. A very ample breakfast and very clean and tidy around all aspect of what is a busy hotel. Any question or query we had was met with a friendly and efficent manner. We had several visitors at the hotel and there needs were also well catered for. It is very near the busy A40 but for ease of getting into or out of London it is very well placed with a tube line nearby. Also to have a car park with easy access despite the current roadworks and not a ridiculous daily rate. As the rooms are elevated above ground level. and well sound proofed so you are not aware of the road.,"February 28, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

Unfortunately, work didn’t go as planned today, so after having checked out this morning, I checked back in again tonight.Upon walking back in the hotel, a young lady called Paula spotted me and said “shouldn’t you have gone home?”.Now that’s quite nice that a member of staff realises you shouldn’t be here, in a good way. So it’s nice to be nice and I think Paula deserves a mention, as she is always helpful.Hotel ideally located for getting to / from centre and my two downsides are; parking can be a bit a pain at times, as can the noise off the A40.","February 7, 2019","12    Holiday Inn London - West

691,"Only one room was ready out of the two we booked when we tried to check in at 2pm, when questioned they stated that they try to have at least one room ready with multiple bookings when concerts are on. So after 5 of us got ready in a twin room! Later we came back after the concert and got the keys to our other room... which was on a different floor, not exactly ideal. We decided to order room service, unfortunately after trying to ring down to order 7 times we gave up and headed down to reception. When we got down there an upset guest was having a disagreement with a member of the reception team, security were present but the guest was clearly distressed and the member of staff on reception was a arguing with her and raising his voice! We then were told it was a 45 minute wait for room service so said we would go and check with the other members of our group to see if they were happy with that and that we’d call down, he assured us he would answer when we did.... he did not answer when we tried to call. Back down to reception we headed to say we’d still like to order our cheese toasties and margarita pizzas. After an hour wait we called reception to see how much longer it was going to be, they hadn’t put our order through!! No apology, nothing! I requested complimentary breakfast the following morning as compensation as we had stayed up until 2am and had to go to bed hungry. The next morning we were seated in the restaurant by who I assume to be the manager, only to be approached by a waiter and informed that breakfast had closed! Not happy, so we made do with what food was left over but the glares we got from staff and being tidied around made us all feel uncomfortable. I informed the member of staff on reception when we checked out as he asked how our stay was so I told him, the same manager that seated us then came out and said “What’s the problem? You ate.”","July 10, 2019","13    Park Plaza London Park Royal

Ordered food just after getting back from the concert , tired and hungry. 45 minutes it eventually turned up without any drinks and was cold. Complained and asked for a refund. Still waiting for the refund. They obviously cannot cope when there are events on in the area as other people were having problems with room service too.

We went back to the reception and and told them.. We went to the bar for a drink, so that would give them some time. At 1.30 am we went back to our room. What the hell. Still nothing had been done and we were really pissed off. We had to wait for them to make the bed and bring towels to take our shower and go to sleep. Had to wait 20 more minutes. A total joke.

711,"Me and my husband recently stayed here for one night, as we were seeing a concert in Wembely Stadium. The hotel has good transport links from central London and the Park Royal underground station is directly opposite the hotel accessed via the underpass.First impressions were really good.The hotel is very modern and hi-tech.Check in was easy and the staff were very helpful.We asked them to pre book a taxi for us to Wembley Stadium as we found this would be quicker than catching the tube as despite the underground being so close,there are no direct tube lines into Wembley from Park Royal underground station.When we got to our room we were thouroghly impressed.The hotel had kindly decorated our bed with confetti and made our towels into swans!The room was huge and had everything we needed and more.The mood lighting was cool and the bathrobes,slippers and complimentary Elemis spa toiletries in the bathroom were a nice touch.We were gutted we were only staying the one night as the room had exceeded our expectations.We then had a drink in the bar while waiting for our taxi.Bar service was quick despite how busy it was due to the other concert goers being there.When we arrived back at our room after the concert, we were very grateful that we had been left 2 complimentary bags of crisps and there was 2 small bottles of vodka and 2 small cans of coke in the fridge.The hotel certainly went over and above by providing these for us.After a very comfortable nights sleep we then went down for breakfast.We went about 8am and we had no problems in getting a table.There was hot buffet,continental,crosiants and pastries and cereal on offer,fresh juice and tea and coffee machines.We found the breakfast to be very tasty.We could have asked for poached or fried eggs if we didn't want the scrambled that was on offer.Overall we had a fantastic nights stay at this ultra modern hotel.As stated the room had exceeded our expectations and we wished we could have stayed an extra night.My only bad point really is the hotel isn't as close to Wembley as first thought.It is not possible to walk there due to the busy main road,and despite the underground being so close, there were no direct tube lines going into Wembley.We would have had to get back into central London just to get on the direct line.Much easier and quicker book a taxi to get you to Wembley.I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.","June 24, 2019","13    Park Plaza London Park Royal

715,"Good for Wembley. Don’t expect room service as it’s too busy after a show, don’t expect a relaxing breakfast. The area is ridiculously small. The bar and reception seating area needs to be reduced to allow for breakfast guest chaos. The wait for being seated is long (I understand this), however, the worst wait is in the buffet restaurant as there were no plates, cups, glasses. Want eggs other than scrambled? No chance. The poor staff are too busy trying to get cutlery and plates out. Guests were sharing a cup between them if they were lucky! Shocking. I attempted calling reception several times, room service, the works. No answer each time. The staff levels are terrible and the complimentary vodka, tonic and bag of crisps (between two guests) caused mass confusion as no card from the hotel stating it was complimentary. Rooms are good enough and clean (we had a king studio). I have never stayed at a Park Plaza and experienced this level of chaos before - ever! This hotel needs some serious fine-tuning.

They had sold out of various drinks which I find most unusual in a hotel of this class. We then decided to order room service......... the phone rang for ages unanswered I then tried the front desk with again no answer. As we were very hungry I went back downstairs to reception.

The breakfast isn't Brill the coffee machines often stop working and they run out of cups or milk jugs. The dim lighting in corridors and dark decor give more of a gloomy feel than stylish, especially in the meeting room section. Staff were friendly and helpful. Menu choices were limited and a bit unimaginative for this type of hotel.","June 20, 2019","13    Park Plaza London Park Royal

723,"Booked as we were going to Wembley. Paid extra for a third person yet this person was not catered for. Arrived and sent up to the room where there was a pull out bed without any bedding, there were not enough towels or coffee for the machine. We called down but after no response, went and asked. They said they’d send someone up. This person came hours later after we had left. When we returned, a door person wouldn’t let us in until they’d checked our room key and when we went up whilst the bed had been made, there still wasn’t enough towels, mugs and toiletries. They had also taken our drinks out of the mini bar fridge (which had nothing in to begin with). Our room was clearly by the laundry as we were woken up by what sounded like washing machines. The bathroom sliding door didn’t fully close and this along with the fact the shower/toilet door not fully closing either meant you couldn’t be in the bathroom in privacy. The shower water leaked through from the shower into the toilet. We booked here as it said close links to Wembley Stadium. You can’t walk there even if you wanted to so add on travel. We expressed our disappointment at check out and were offered a complimentary drink but considering our room cost nearly £250 and we were actually treated as a couple, we should have been offered some money back.

735,i arrived in london from holland and had to negotiate my way via the tube . when i got to park royal station no lift only two flights of stairs.holy schweppes i was lucky a couple of young men helped me get the bags up the stairs. i could see the hotel on the opposite side of the road with no visible way of getting to it. at the station they told me there was a underpass up the road which i managed to negotiate with difficulty. the hotel staff were what id call ok not fabulous but ok . the room was really good no complaints there. when i went for breakfast the place was packed out. admittedly it was easter weekend. the funny thing was you couldn't put the cost of breakfast onto your bill you had to pay there and then . i had communication problems with the girl on the counter saying i wanted to be charged in pound on my debit card. it was like barking up a gumtree. people were asking when all the different things that had run out would be replaced. eventually most gave up . it appeared most staff didn't have english as a first language. this was something i found all over the uk . when i had to leave for heathrow i was faced with the prospect of getting my luggage to the station and hoping i could find someone to help me. when i booked this hotel it advertises that its close to heathrow.nothing about needing a car to get there. i asked staff roughly what the price of a taxi would be and nearly had cardiac arrest. note to self check that nearest tube station has a lift next .,"May 19, 2019","13    Park Plaza London Park Royal

The staff member went back down to get pastries and a different fruit and returned with only pastries. I then ordered breakfast the second day (included in my booking) and was charged nearly £5 just for it to be brought to my room. The following day I went downstairs for breakfast. I asked were the vegetarian options were as this was on the menu. Waited a while for someone to check and was told they would bring me vegetarian sausages. I had finished my whole breakfast and waited for an extra 5-10mins and this never arrived, I eventually left. Room was clean and of good quality and facilities at hotel are good.

738,"Due to an exceptional case, we cancelled a booking for five nights at central London and luckily found Park Plaza at Park Loyal with reasonable price. It turns out to be a good choice. From the very beginning I was a bit disappointed by the location of this hotel because it is at 3rd district in London (according to London Tube map) so it takes more time to visit city center. However, we soon got used to this distance and became comfortable because of the easy access to the tube itself. The hotel is so close to the tube station that the distance does not bother any more. It was also disappointing when I entered into the room after check-in due to bad smell. I even wanted to quit staying here. The staff accepted my complain about the smell and tried to change the room for me. One day after I got to learn that the smell comes from the chemical cleaning stuff. The hotel has indeed a ""Go Green"" plan, for which you may even get 10 pound discount if you skip the room service per night. In order to avoid that smell, I've chosen the Go Green option. The towels got updated still every day, which is pretty enough for us. The bed is comfortable here. Space is enough to turn around. TV is also a good set. On the day for an early check-out, hotel has also prepared breakfast-takeway for us. This is also nice. The downside is that I don't like the detergent which this hotel has used. It smelled so awful and I got indeed sick of it after one and half hour stay. Luckily there is a spare room to exchange with.Overall, we are satisfied and feel comfortable staying here with a rather reasonble price compared to that in central London.","May 10, 2019","13    Park Plaza London Park Royal

When I was in the cafe area later guests were struggling to check in as apart from the bar staff nobody was around.My room was facing the main road and transport hub so was very noisy if I wanted the window open. Aircon was very slow to get going, taking 20/30 minutes to start to pump out cooled air, not good when the temperature was 28 degrees!!The shower was good and powerful, and the bathroom clean. The bed was an absolute joke. Obviously a super cheap mattress had seen better days so a thin topper had been put on top which slipped around if you turned over, and was just plain inadequate for the job.Decent wifi and USB charging points in the room were welcome.My room was serviced every day except one, when the maid was still cleaning at 5pm, so I just got clean towels from her.Bar/cafe area was set out well, non-guests seem to make up a large number of visitors, but somewhere to sit was always free when I wanted it.All in all a decent budget hotel in a good location.","July 10, 2019","14    Ibis London Canning Town

The room also had plenty of power points to charge multiple devices if needed.The toilet/shower room is sleek and modern and even has a shower seat attached to the wall if needed.The area around the hotel is less tourist than other places and personally although the food in the in-hotel restaurant was tasty and well priced for London I found the menu to be a little basic there are plenty places to eat and shop at the O2 less than 5 mins away and the high street across the road has a Co-Op and restaurants.

The only thing that doesn't make my review excellent was the fact our room neighbours were very noisy, playing loud music and shouting from 6pm - to 3am and there were no staff around to tackle this. I completely realise and understand that the behaviour of their customers is not their fault but possibly a few corridor checks could combat any anti-social behaviour and make visiting the hotel comfortable for all customers, not just those who are young and like to get drunk and have a party in their rooms.","April 9, 2019","14    Ibis London Canning Town

768,"Stayed for three nights at this hotel so that I could attend meetings near the Tower of London and at the IET, Savoy Place. Staff were very welcoming and I had a nice relatively quiet room on the fifth floor. I had breakfast each day, which as with most hotels is a little pricey, but you can eat as much as you want and there is a variety of food on offer. Unfortunately I didn't try food in the evenings, but other people seemed to find it OK. If you want to go out to eat, there is a nice Italian restaurant about 5 minutes walk down the road and there may be other restaurants near by. Access to public transport is very good, with the Jubilee Line giving access to Westminster and the western part of London, whilst the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) provides frequent access to London City Airport, the Excel Centre, and central London view Tower Hill.","March 18, 2019","14    Ibis London Canning Town

775,"Very nice modern hotel located across the tube station. The area is being completely regenerated with City Island being constructed just across the bridge. It only takes 15-20 min to get to Green Park on the Jubilee line so easy access to the city. There are a just a few restaurants within walking distance including Zzetta Soul Fired Pizza, but then again London has so much to offer. Rooms are nice and modern, lounge downstairs is also very nice with a bar that is open late. Breakfast is ok for GBP 10.40. Typical 3 star hotel buffet breakfast, we went twice but the first time was better than the last. You have to pay upfront for it.Most of the people who work there are very young (and seem a little unexperienced) but friendly from all parts of the world. The only negative I could find is that the hotel promotes to be environmentally friendly, however they still use tons of plastic, have plastic spoons and cups in the room even wrapped in plastic. There are also no recycling bins available. They say they treasure the environment by not replacing towels unless you want them too, however even though we never put the towels on the bathroom floor they still replaced them every day. Quite a bit of greenwashing.","February 25, 2019","14    Ibis London Canning Town

789,"This is one of the new style ibis hotels without a reception desk. Instead you are greeted by wandering staff with a company shirt and touch pad to check you in.I arrived at 8:30pm and on inquiring was told the restaurant was open until 10pm and then thereafter there would be their 24 hour menu. I went to my room to do an hour's work and came down to eat just before 9:30pm. When I could eventually attract the attention of the bar staff (how can 3 staff so studiously ignore a customer at the bar) I was told they had shut the restaurant early and there was no food (and no apology).I spoke to the reception staff, who told me the restaurant wasn't their responsibility and if I wanted some food I should try going outside and looking down the high street. I ended up with a sandwich from the local co-op.Now my real complaint is not that the restaurant shut early - for all I know there might have been a good reason. The problem is no one cared. No apology from the restaurant staff, no apology from the hotel staff. Indeed no one in charge who seemed at all concerned about the well-being of residents.I use ibis quite frequently, and generally across Europe they are a reliable chain of hotels.

790,"Located directly facing the Canning Town Tube/DLR station and bus terminal, this hotel is perfect for anyone attending the O2. It is a new hotel so everything is clean, bright and sparkling. Minimal but appropriate décor makes the room compact and attractive.Check in/out is a bit weird as you think you are walking into a restaurant, as indeed you are. No obvious reception area is to be seen, only what appears to be waiters and waitresses standing around. Look closer at their red attire and you will see Reception printed on them.Staff - very welcoming but the lack of a focal point does create problems. When busy, customers tend to mill around the reception person and it can be a bit of ‘loudest and most aggressive is next’. Arriving early we were given the choice of leaving our luggage free of charge or access to the room a few hours in advance of normal booking for a cost (£10) - Ryanair policies live at Ibis.Room was more than adequate for short stays but I certainly wouldn’t want to have a lengthy residence in what is a small but well laid out accommodation. Desk, wall mounted desk lamp which doubles as the main room light, tea making facilities, hair drier and easy access power point complete with 2 USB points & TV are all supplied with free Wi-fi throughout.Beds are very comfortable and the room was well soundproofed as the area is on the flight path of some pretty large jets. Lifts to all floors controlled by key car.Although we didn’t eat in the restaurant or have a drink at the bar, it did seem that the food was popular but the bar offering a bit limited.General - an excellent value for money hotel.","December 5, 2018","14    Ibis London Canning Town

A toaster if you want toast, and an Egg boiler device with no instructions. Hence at least one person trying to eat a raw egg not realising its cook it yourself.Fresh fruit and yogurt was available with a huge dish of frozen solid red fruits to top your choiceThe Hot offerings look nice enough but because so much is prepared in advance and left piled high under so called heat lamps, the two breakfast i had were best described as warm. The second morning not warm enough to eat.The bacon was terrible - (I have had better bacon in Benidorm) and served laying in 2cm of grease in the serving dish.They also do not seem to have enough salt and pepper pots to go around.The Hotel is Very handy for Canning Town Station and only 2 stops away from Excel.The morning rush and breakfast lets this reasonable hotel down.

Modern rooms and novel power extension and charger were welcome, as was the roomy shower rooms (something Ibis has slipped on in the past).It has a number of glitches though. The lack of a delineated reception area coupled with insufficient staff numbers and unclear directions on how to check in, ask for help or check out was incredibly frustrating. Terrible pizza and technical issues with door locks also didn't help. If Ibis sorts out these challenges, this would be a great hotel but beware, patience is needed if you stay there in the short term.

798,"Clean and modern hotel. You can tell they are fairly new and have kept the place in top shape. I enjoyed being so close to the Canning Town undeground/DLR station especially on those rainy days. Can get into central London in about 20 mins and easy to get to. Room is very basic- firm bed- more like mattress topper, clean bathroom, and I appreciated the 2 usb plugs provided/hair dryer. Didn't have enough hangers for the small closet but worked it out. Only thing I would suggest is providing a wash cloth with the towels, I had to go out and buy my own. Air conditioning was decent but wished heat went a little higher- was cold one of the rainy nights. Housekeeping was egar to clean my room but did not need services- they provided toilet paper when needed. Breakfast was a great variety for the price- 10.40 pounds, the attendant was friendly and helpful. If you want hot and fresh go around 7 am- no one awake then really. Anything after good luck, it gets busy. The day I arrived was on a Saturday and place was swamped with check in and outs. I would suggest getting more staff during those busy times- the staff seemed to be annoyed with everyone and not very friendly at first. If you arrive before check in and there are no rooms available you can leave your luggage and check in later. I read other reviews to ask for a room regardless and you can pay 10 pounds to magically get into one. It worked. You have to insist you will pay and they will confirm that there is a room available, even if they say it's full at first. Glad it worked for me due to flying for 13 hours and needing sleep. Quiet place for the most part, but if you have loud neighbors you can hear the door slam in your room and will think the neighbors are trying to get into your door. Someone had left a dirty sock on my door one night because I had the do not disturb sign up, pretty sure it was drunk people or kids playing a prank. The lock on my door did not work from the inside but no one came into my room the 6 days I stayed. If you are looking for a clean place to stay, close to the underground, reasonable price, and don't mind the bare necessities I would recommend this place. Also, if you are looking for late night food the bar stops selling food at 9:30 pm. They only have a few options to sell afterwards- crisps, soda, and frozen pizza. Did not get the pizza. You are better off getting snacks and having them in your room. Also, if you are leaving early morning the doors are locked and you have to press a button to get out next to the door. Staff around the morning time usually were busy doing other things.","October 30, 2018","14    Ibis London Canning Town

799,My husband and I stayed in London for a few days and stayed at the Z hotel city. Our room was in the basement and it was a bit of a surprise when we saw the compact and window-less features of our room. But we adjusted easily and the complimentary wine and cheese every evening more than made up for it. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful to us. The rooms and building were very clean. We really loved the area the hotel was situated in and how close it was to the Temple metro station. Overall Z hotel city is a great find.,"July 10, 2019","15    The Z Hotel City

Good mirror and hairdryer provided. The free cheese and wine was a lovely touch. I took the wine to my room and drank it while changing for a black tie dinner. I slept very well. I hadn’t paid for breakfast but went into the cafe attached to the hotel and was able to order what I wanted. The staff were absolutely superb.

Needn't have worried, Ron was well laid out with air conditioning. It also encourages you to head out.While there is a place to eat, you are in a cafe that will be frequented by commuters. I used it once but decided to use a cafe in the office campus I was working in. Just like the other hotel I stayed in the previous week, there are plenty of pubs.Check in and out was very efficient, staff always said hello. Room was clean, always fresh everyday. Very important, the glass pod shower room was fantastic.Very comfortable place to stay.Gripe? The lack of a decent desk to get that last hours work crammed in.

804,On arrival to the Z hotel staff were lovely polite & let us keep our cases there till we could check in . First impression lovely clean hotel Once checked into the room couldn’t believe how small it was. Three adults had to share this room . When you walked in the door bathroom was on the left bunk beds the right . No room to move about . The toilet door was frosted but you could see through it . My mom was not impressed . The steps to the top bunk were not the best & the bottom bunk we kept banging our heads on the top. We struggled to get ready for our west end show ! This room is one person two at the most . It was clean & had plenty of tea / coffee / hot choc but the room was a big dissertation a shame really has the hotel itself was in a great location & the free cheese & wine on the night was a lovely touch . The breakfast was a buffet style hot food toast & pastries .. was lovely . If your ok with being in each other’s faces & bearing all in the toilet ha ha then this is a good hotel not very good for more than 2 people & again the bathroom door could of been more frosted ! ,"May 15, 2019","15    The Z Hotel City

We were apprehensive to visit at first due to the size of the rooms, however, the hotel is so clean and tidy. Even though the rooms are very compact and quite small, they are all you really need when visiting London. The beds are amazingly comfortable. Having Sky TV is also a bonus! The location is perfect, when we visit here, everything for us is in walking distance, however the nearest tube is a very short walk away. So really location is perfect. The staff are always so welcoming and cannot do enough for you. Able to leave bags in storage upon check out if you are staying in London after checking out! Don't hesitate to book this hotel if you do not mind compact rooms, because you will not be disappointed! My boyfriend joined the Z member's and that offers deals, which make the price even more reasonable. We always stay here upon our visits to London! The ONLY thing if we were being picky would be the breakfast is quite expensive when there are cafe's down the road which are cheaper, but it is a lovely place to eat, and in the evenings they offer FREE cheese and wine which is always lovely!","May 8, 2019","15    The Z Hotel City

807,"When we arrived there was a fresh pitcher of complimentary ice tea to sip at while you’re checked in - which was very nice as it was very hot when we arrived. All the staff were so helpful and friendly and nothing was too much to ask. The rooms are on the small side but for a city break that’s all the room you need as you don’t spend much time there anyway! However, this doesn’t take away from the fact that the rooms are very stylishly decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The room was also equipped with a large flat screen tv (with sky and all the catch up channels), air conditioning, a water jug, a kettle and a variety of teas, coffees and hot chocolates to choose from. The free cheese and wine from 5-8 was amazing and we were there every night! They’re not at all stingy with wine and staff even come to the table to ask if you want a top up, and you can have as many helpings of cheese, bread, grapes and chutneys as you like. You can even take your wine to your room if you don’t want to drink it in the dining room. My only wish is that we were given more coat hangers as there was 4 coat hangers in a room so we only got 2 each - but apart from that I can’t fault it. We had an amazing stay and are looking forward to staying with them again.","April 26, 2019","15    The Z Hotel City

Large enough shower, staff very helpful and friendly! Offered the free cheese and wine but we had dinner booked already. Only pre warning I would give is if you are sharing a room, make sure you are all very close and not shy! The bathroom glass is pretty much see through enough that you can see whats going on!

My room had a second queen sized bed on a mezzanine over the floor level bed: could be fun for families for a one night novelty. Complementary wine and cheese 6-8pm is a good idea. It's a slightly bigger bedroom than Bloc Hotel, Birmingham - I haven't tried Premier Inn's Hub format yet, but am keen to.Cons:It's not the sort of bedroom you would want to spend much waking time in, particularly if there is more than one of you: if you want that sort of room, book a Premier Inn or other hotel with conventional larger rooms.

We also loved the complimentary wine and cheese from 6-8pm. We have enjoyed similar perks at hotels in America but they have never been as good as this.

We knew from the start that the rooms were going to be small from the hotel's description (which would appear honest) and trip advisor reviews, but was intrigued by the concept and was not disappointed, we both absolutely loved it!!! The room was small but modern, loved how all the space was efficiently used, totally comfortable bed, wide screen TV on wall, clean and modern shower & toilet, tea/coffee facilities, heating/aircon and quiet room! Good shower and toiletries provided. Toilet/shower had glass screen/opaque glass doors, which whilst still provided modesty, may not appeal to everyone (depending how familiar you are). Wall hooks to hang clothes, under-bed storage for small cases (may struggle with larger luggage). Had every convenience associated with larger hotel rooms - just more compact. Check in and check out was quick and efficient. Loved the complimentary wine and cheese served between 5 - 8pm, which was a nice touch.

My room was a double, and the clever use of space in such a small room was impressive and interesting. Bed comfortable, everything very clean, tiny desk, massive tv. Unlike some other reviewers I liked the en suite's glass walls, it was private but didn't feel claustrophobic like some of the ""plastic pods"" can get. Nice and clean, powerful shower, fluffy white towels and not a hint of damp. Breakfast was ok, the dining room was interesting but the choice was a little limited. I was unlucky in that the salmon and boiled eggs I'd fancied from the menu weren't available. Unfortunately I didn't have a great night's sleep because I couldn't get the temperature warm enough without leaving the noisy air con/heater thing on all night.

The rooms are small - correct - but are perfectly designed to include everything that is necessary. The standard double room I stayed in is ideal for either 1 person or a couple (if you don’t mind being close with them).The bathroom was separated from the room with elegant, tinted sliding doors that gave a classy, modern feel. The shower was very impressive- black glass/tiles that made it seem brand new! The cleanliness of the room and bathroom was faultless. I personally cannot stand an unclean room, so for it to impress me was a plus! The appliances were all top quality and again seemingly brand new. A huge flatscreen was sunk into the wall directly in front of the bed, and was using sky so I was able to watch any programme (movies for me). Breakfast I payed for when I checked in and it was lovely! A wide range of hot and cold foods were set out in a buffet style for you to help yourself to. Luggage room proved useful the next day to save me and my friend dragging cases around the tubes!

828,"My partner booked this hotel for us for a theatre weekend in London staying Friday 21st and Saturday 22nd September. First of all the location is great, it really is a base for you to explore, Covent garden and the theatres are literally a 10 minute walk away and with plenty to see along the way it's a nice little stroll. The tube is the same about a 10 minute walk and from here you are around 2 stops away from Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street and with a simple change onto the Victoria Line you are at St Pancras very quickly if this is where you need to travel to/from. First impressions of the hotel were great, extremely clean, it smells amazing when you walk in that was one of the things we first picked up on! The check in staff were lovely and the process was quick and simple. I had obviously done my research into this hotel and it is very clear that this is a modern space spacing design. We had booked a room without a window which was perfect for us, but perhaps if you are claustrophobic it might not be the best idea! We stayed in room 615. Extremely clean, very cosy with the large TV equipped with all sky channels is fixed to the wall directly opposite the bed and we loved this. There isn't a lot of floor space, but again this is expected, if you hang your clothes on the hanging wall and store things down the side of the bathroom area, it's easily done if you are only staying a couple of nights.I have seen mentioned before the fact of the frosted glass bathroom area, I know from responses this is to create the illusion of more space, however if you are staying in these types of rooms, you need to be extremely close to your partner/friend/family member as you can see everything and hear everything and I really mean that, there is no privacy whatsoever. Luckily this wasn't an issue for me and my boyfriend but if you have only been together a short amount of time, it may be! The view of your companion sat on the toilet is literally a stones throw away as you relax on the bed. Rooms had a kettle, two large mugs, tea bags, coffee, hot chocolate sachets and sugar/sweeteners. I myself only drink decaf so the sachets of nescafe decaf coffee were a very welcome sight, however I really would like to see hotels introducing decaf tea bags as not many do.If I had to make a comment on anything that was slightly inconvenient, again I have already seen this mentioned, there is one single light that is a green colour and it is the only light that doesn't turn off, I personally am someone who likes complete darkness when I sleep and this is quite off putting as it's almost like having a TV still on in the middle of the night. Also although no fault of the hotel's i'm sure, on the Friday night, our first night stay I was awoken to the sound of someone forcefully trying to enter our room for a good 5 minutes before probably realising they'd got the wrong room number. As we had booked a room with no window we were on the very ground floor and you do get a lot of banging around from people walking around above quite early in the morning unfortunately. These small points where literally the only things that were ever so slightly inconvenient about the whole stay.The hotel umbrella's that were available to borrow were very welcome as this weekend was extremely wet and cold so this was a really useful feature. It was a shame that we didn't find the time to sample the free wine and cheese, but we will definitely be back at some point in the future to be able to do so.Little tip, the pub right next door is lovely for drinks and food. Nice atmosphere and really reasonably priced!","September 24, 2018","15    The Z Hotel City

829,"This has to be the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in, and yet that didn't matter. The space was designed to be incredibly functional, so it had a double bed, a small desk, some hanging space, and an en suite shower room, all packed into an area marginally larger than two double beds. Opening the door took up most of the available floor space, but the room was designed that way - and as it was just me and an overnight bag that wasn't a problem. I was more interested in a comfortable bed (yes), clean (yes), reasonably quiet (yes) and location (yes - right on Fleet Street).If you're in town for a short business stay, definitely book it. If you're here for longer on holiday, or travelling as a couple, the room I had might be a challenge, but worth checking whether they have anything bigger available.","September 16, 2018","15    The Z Hotel City

Our first evening we had a most constructive business meeting, ideas boosted by free flowing wine, and our thoughts assisted by the wonderful staff helping with ideas (nothing better than a fresh pair of eyes or three to find new angles)... Probably the most useful meeting we've had! Thank you to Mateus, Dora and the lovely blonde lass who's name escapes me (too much wine?).

The breakfast was under £10 each, not bad but more continental than good old fashioned full English, staff were very helpful and friendly, I would say it’s a convenient bed for the night, maybe 2 but probably would stay here a week...","August 26, 2018","15    The Z Hotel City

The room was extremely clean and quiet, with a comfortable bed and nice touches (a bottle of water in the room, some toiletries, etc). It was incredibly small but absolutely fine for what I needed (and was advertised as such), and had effective air con. Customer service was very good, and I was given a complimentary glass of wine which was an unexpected bonus! They were happy to store my suitcase for the day once I'd checked out, too. The breakfast was fine - quite tasty scrambled eggs - though I hadn't realised it was essentially in a cafe that's open to the public, which meant it was rather busy.

Alessandra in particular (an Italian native) went out of her way to make restaurant and tea room reservations for us.

The selection of cheeses were varied and the choices of wines exceeded our expectations.

837,"The only thing that really commends this hotel is where it is, assuming that you have business in that area. The room was not small - it was tiny. It was spotlessly clean but did not have an available drawer or even a shelf (other than in the bathroom) to put anything, and the 'wardrobe' consisted of a series of hooks on the wall. The 'desk' was about the size of a chopping board, taken up largely by a kettle/coffee tray. The bed was comfortable, the aircon efficient and the roll-down blinds effective. The aircon, however, 'spits out' its accumulated condensation regularly (about every 15 mins) with a nosy pump into the loo cistern. At first I though that my neighbor must have been suffering from incontinence, but it was the aircon...all night. The staff are brilliant, and the in-house café has reasonable breakfast and a very pleasant cheese and wine buffet in the early evenings. It is by no means cheap - over 550 quid for three nights - but is less expensive than its immediately adjacent competitor Apex Serjeant's Inn (where the rooms are infinitely better).Not somewhere I would chose to stay again, and certainly not a place for a family.","July 22, 2018","15    The Z Hotel City

850,"I know it's Fleet Street but £210 for an 8ft square room with no windows and no breakfast seems a bit less than good value. I seem to remember Easyjet hotels in London being a similar size but they were £10 a night. The walls hug the bed on 3 sides. The floor space that isn't bed is as long as the bed and as wide as the door, so it can open. The bin is under the bed and the kettle would touch your face if you were in bed. But my actual gripe is that there's a green night light over the door so the entire room is bathed in green light all night. The TV is over the bed and set into the wall so you can't turn it off. The red sleep light has to stay on all night 7ft from your face. All the electronic lights do not make for easy sleeping, although if you're afraid of the dark I suppose it might be a plus. There is a free gift, a cloth mouse mat with a map of London design if anybody still uses mouse mats and There is a 3 hour period every night where they provide unlimited free wine and cheese but wasted on me as I don't drink wine. I'd rather have a cheaper room. Or breakfast instead! I wouldn't stay here again unless it was proper cheap. The staff, however deserve real credit.

Me and my partner stayed here on the 30th March 2019 and loved it, I originally booked a street view room but as it was my fiancé’s 21st birthday I emailed the hotel asking whether I would be able to upgrade.Benjamin was lovely and said that he would leave a note on our reservation for a nice room - so we got there and were put into a garden view room which was lovely.As they knew it was my partners birthday they left a little note in the room and also gave him two bottles of Prosecco and a plate of grapes, strawberries and chocolate - which was a lovely gesture.The hotel is by North Ealing tube station but as Ealing Broadway station was only about a 10 minute walk away, me and my partner used that one because it’s a central line. I’m always a bit wary of walking around anywhere at night but Ealing is such a lovely place, I felt very safe walking to and from the station/hotel at night.

The room had a small kitchen area in it and owing to the young age of the kids we just bought some milk and honey nut cornflakes in the shop which was less than a minutes walk away.The tube is only a minute or so away and is an easy journey into London on the picadilly line which takes about 20 minutes to reach the centre.

868,"We stayed here for 2 nights for the weekend with our teenage son for a London trip.We had 2 rooms, neither of which looked much like the hotel website rooms but were perfectly adequate.Beds were comfy and rooms nice and quiet at night.Downsides were no milk provided for with tea/ coffee facilities, very sung bathroom and no plug socket near the mirror for my wife to dry her hair. We ate breakfast both mornings and that was adequate although service could have been a little more welcoming ( no explanation to help yourself to continental breakfast or any offer of cooked breakfast- we had to ask). Despite this location is great - station into London right behind the hotel and taking 20- 25 minutes.","March 1, 2019","16    Hotel 55

869,"Had to find an affordable Hotel in London for the night and so many are sooo expensive in London - so I opted for the Hotel 55 as it was so much more affordable than Zone 1 that's for sure! The Tube (North Ealing) is just a 2 minute stroll away and it is only a 25 - 30 minute ride into the centre. Check-in was a breeze and the welcome was really down to earth and friendly. The Hotel has no lift, but I only had a ruck sack, but the nice thing was I was still asked if I needed a hand with my luggage. My room was of a 4 Star Standard and I slept amazingly well! Plenty of hot water in the morning was great from the power shower - which I could of stayed under all day!.lol... Free Wifi was a bonus and the signal was great. Free Bottled of Water was great to glug and Nespresso Machine was a nice touch too! The Complimentary Continental Breakfast (as I booked direct) was sufficient and filled me up for the morning as it was buffet style - so help yourself was great! The public areas were great - I imagine the garden and its terrace is lovely in the Summer, but the lounge area and its ""library"" feel is very relaxing. All in all I will be definitely booking as the price was great and the Tube is just £2.80 into the City after 9.30 am! The Staff definitely make the Hotel too..Everyone was so down to earth, no heirs or graces like the big hotel chains..Customer Service skills are to be commended to be honest! I will be back and book again direct because of the free continental breakfast - I love the word free!..Thank you!!","February 15, 2019","16    Hotel 55

876,"All in all, a nice hotel, with lovely but small rooms, friendly staff and an upmarket feel. A powerful shower is great in the morning, but my room being on the second floor did tax my knees a little, no lift. I liked the nice touches like a fridge in the room, but the fancy nespresso coffee machine with nothing to use in it confused me. Had to go and ask for normal teabags too, had every type but. The continental breakfast is pretty basic, but adequate for people who want a bowl of cereal and some toast, or fruit. The biggest thing for me was the parking. I was staying the whole week, and not once did I get parked in front of the hotel. It was a case of the station car park or finding one on the street in between permit times. After a day at work, car park roulette wasn't my idea of fun. I was booked for the following week, but cancelled mainly because of that. Great place for a cpl nights, and meters from the local underground, its great for a break, but as a weeks base for work, not so much. I didn't sample the Japanese restaurant on the site, not really partial to that cuisine. ","January 16, 2019","16    Hotel 55

Room was cosy Air Con was switched off, I switched on to get some air and even tho it was on 18 it was blowing really warm, so I switched off and opened a window. Obviously that let in traffic noise as it’s right on the main road. The tube is literally 2 mins away. If you need somewhere to park on a weekend the stations car park is only 2 quid all day Saturday and I think Sunday. It’s just past the hotel and turn right, then it’s slightly to the right I think. Hotel was good a bit pricey for what it was but it’s location mainly, I didn’t eat there so can’t tell you about momo the Japanese restaurant.

Sound proofing wasn't brilliant but it didn't bother me, a child crying in the room next door woke me up a number of times (not the hotel's fault I completely understand) and I could also easily hear the shower in the room above.Having said that I would certainly stay here again and would recommend.","October 28, 2018","16    Hotel 55

The staff were all super.Be aware that there is no lift in the hotel. It's only two floors, but with a lot of luggage, this could be an issue. A bigger issue for me was the size of my room. There was literally no room for a suitcase - the bed took up the entire room with only a sliver of space in between the bed and the wardrobe and on the other side, the bed and the window. I had to roll across the bed to get from one side of the room to the other! I basically had to keep my (roll-aboard) suitcase closed and in the bathroom, which was equally tiny.I think there are larger rooms but apparently they were in noisier parts of the hotel. It was clean, cool, and quiet (although my window faced some sort of walkway with very bright lights on late into the night) - and I don't mind tiny - but no place to walk in the room, much less work out of it if needed.

I walked from the Tube station (North Ealing) - it’s no more than five minutes to walk and the hotel was easy to find.At check-in I was greeted by a friendly staff member who was keen to make sure I had everything I needed both for my stay and also for my departure (he wanted to be sure that I knew there would be tube strikes that could get in the way of my travel plans the following day).The room I had was fairly snug, not too small but it could probably be better laid-out for space (there wasn’t a desk, just a narrow dressing table that was already full with coffee machine, kettle, glasses, mugs, tea/coffee). As I was travelling for work a better space for setting up my laptop would have been helpful.At check-in I was warned that the TV reception was poor (they were awaiting an engineer) but the WiFi was working so I didn’t miss not having a good TV service.The room is obviously not newly decorated, but still in reasonable condition, and the decor is modern and well considered.The shower room was adequate, again not spacious, but not the smallest I have encountered.It was noticeable that I could hear other guests (in particular in the corridor outside my room) but it wasn’t sustained throughout the evening/night.Breakfast the following morning was good, a nice selection of cereals, pastries, fruits, yogurt etc.","September 28, 2018","16    Hotel 55

The reviews were mainly very good so we took a chance and we are so glad we did. The hotel couldn't be in a better location for exploring London. North Ealing tube station is literally 2 minutes walk away. For all you theatre lovers, you can get straight into Leicester Square from there within approx 30 mins. Coming from Heathrow Airport, take the Picadilly Line tube to Acton Town and continue on the Picadilly Line to North Ealing (that line branches out but doesn't go directly to North Ealing). Ealing Broadway village is only 10 minutes walk away, where there are loads of shops and restaurants to check out. Now, back to the hotel! The hotel is spotless and is more than a 3 star to be honest. It's immaculate. Our room was small but had everything we needed. Bottled water and L'Occitane products are standard in the room so no need to drag bottles of shower gel and shampoo/conditioner with you as the stuff is lovely!

It is spotlessly clean and the rooms have everything for a short stay. The restaurant is Japanese and very good quality. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating.

We chose this hotel due to needing free parking (although is very limited so would confirm and arrive early to secure a spot) and it’s location being extremely close to the metro and in a safe area. This boutique hotel is refurbished to a lovely modern style and our room was lovely with nice clean and shiny shower En-Suite. I must admit I didn’t have the best night sleep due to street noise, too much street/ neighbors lights through the windows (even with blinds down) and a door kept banging shut (perhaps the reception door to the stairs? As we were on the first floor) throughout the night and guests arriving during the early hours... I’m a light sleeper but it didn’t bother my husband, perhaps a room on a higher floor would be quieter. The North Ealing tube station is literally a 2 minute walk around the corner making it very easy to get in and out of central London.

No reply so when we arrived we saw the outside parking of approx 4 cars was full so had to park at the Tube Station. Man on reception when we checked in didn’t seem bothered & said although we could park in front of hotel & leave the keys .. he couldn’t drive so that was pointless. I explained how worried I was about leaving car in tube car park with blue badge but he offered no othe.Found our room 110 .. although it was a modern clean room .. it was so small .. everything was miniature! It was a double room with garden view but the view was over some outbuilding then into the garden! There was one chair .. nowhere to put anything & the bathroom was equally small .. it was so claustrophobic that we couldn’t wait to leave the next day.We usually use the Holiday Inn at Wembley but it was full .. for £98 for this hotel I’d definitely look elsewhere as it’s not worth the money.We won’t be returning.,"June 20, 2018","16    Hotel 55

There was a mini bar, coffee maker as well as a kettle and a good selection of teas. The room although and compact but well equipped with everything needed. Also a very good size TV and wifi. The continental breakfast offered a good selection of cereals, fruits, breads and pastries.There was also a selection of fruit juices teas and coffeesThere is a cooked breakfast option but we did not use it.The continental breakfast is included if you book direct with the hotel, which we had done.We would also like to praise the staff who are extremely helpful and friendly.Our trip was a special one to our daughters graduation.The hotel is ideally situated, near tube and over ground train services.We will be revisiting again and already have rebooked for our trip In March. Looking forward to our stay.","February 24, 2018","16    Hotel 55

902,"Had a weekend trip with my wife whilst helping our son move to student accommodation in Ealing. Found the accommodation on-line and the booking of it was easy. It is fairly close to Ealing Broadway shopping and tube station, and the tube into central London is just over 20 mins, so is well connected. The hotel has very nice bedrooms that are equipped as you would expect but has a lovely ambience. Very comfortable beds and a nice shower/bathroom. The rooms have minibars available along with a kettle and a selection of teas/coffees The decor is modern and appealing throughout. We did not eat in the Japanese restaurant that is connected but we did have breakfast which was a very nice continental style affair. The only real issue was the lack of parking with only 4 usable spaces available. The reception seemed to be manned 24/7 which is unusual for this size of hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for something different from a Premier Inn or similar and I will be staying there again if we end up going to that neck of the woods again.","January 18, 2018","16    Hotel 55

903,"Stayed here for 1 night NYE with my fiancé, only 4 car park spaces so had to park in the train station car park and walk round. was less than 5 mins walk so didn't mind to much. Guy on the reception was really friendly and got us checked in really quick. First impression, quirky little hotel, easy to find. nice lay out on inside. room was quite small but was enough for one night. Few things that let it down (not their fault) but it was very noisy, we got back to the room and 2:30am after seeing the fireworks, music was blasting somewhere in the hotel and could hear the traffic noise from outside.few other things, the bed was quite hard, the shower did not get hot act all, even on the hottest temperature setting it was merely over lukewarm and the flush on the toilet was broken. overall an average stay for the night, but those few things let it down, would have stayed here again otherwise","January 3, 2018","16    Hotel 55

904,"Stopped here with my trusted travelling partner, who I believe has become far more critical than me in his 9 years of travel! We gave this hotel a thumbs up, a pleasant surprise just outside Central London and no more than 2min walk to the tube station. The hotel is on a main road and if the carpark is full on road parking is available. We did not notice the noise of the main road. The hotel staff were very helpful and polite. Unfortunately MOMO was closed but it is Christmas and we all need a break at some point. Would I stay here again? Yes. Decor is modern and reflected throughout the hotel not just the lobby as is often the case. We were a 10min drive from white city and with pre payment parked just off Oxford Street for £19 covering twelve hours.....cheaper than tube tickets for the whole family.

907,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and overall were mostly happy with our stay. The hotel is in a great location very close to multiple transport links (central line London Underground, London Overground and buses) which is very handy for moving around London.On arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by friendly staff and check in was quick and easy. There are lifts serving all floors. The room is basic (as expected) and was clean. The bed was comfortable. We did not eat any meals in the hotel.Our only issues seemed to centre around the bathroom. The shower had very poor water pressure and at the highest temperature was just about warm. Only one towel for each person was provided and no hand towel so you have to use the towels for drying hands then use them damp to dry yourself after the shower while your wet hair is dripping down your back. The towels are also extremely poor quality. They are grey, thin and threadbare. I certainly wasn’t expecting pure white fluffy towels, but these have definitely seen better days and should be replaced. All in all, we were happy with our stay and would book again.

911,Stayed here one night. Great location for Westfield shopping centre and the 'tube'. The Hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. Breakfast was ok but hot drinks machine not working. The room..... very basic is it shown in the photos on website. The bathroom was weird.... had to step up into it.... I felt like I was in a caravan. The towels!!!!! what can I say other than they need throwing away and investment in linen needs to be done. We got one bath towel each. No hand towel which I found strange. The 'bath' towel itself must have been white at some time... but after numerous washes was now 'grey' and see through.... it was so thin I could see through it. Tea & coffee making facilities in room great with a kettle that boils fast. would have liked a tea spoon though instead of a wooden stirrer stick.,"June 25, 2019","17    Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel

My daughter booked ahead and informed them it was my birthday (unbeknown to me) On arrival I was pleasantly surprised to find in my room birthday balloons, chocolates, a card and a gift all set up for me. This was such a lovely little touch and much appreciated. The rooms was lovely and we had a nice comfortable stay. The following morning we went down for a lovely buffet breakfast and again the staff surprised me with some chocolates and a slice of cake with a candle in it and sang me Happy Birthday!

This is not an opulent hotel, but if you are in London and you will be out most of the time, this a good choice. My only concern is that even in this cold weather the hotel was really hot, we had to ask for an extra fan to be put inside our room. Also the “double” bed for 02 adults is pretty small, there were a lot of noise from outside because of a fair going on nearby but that happened because we had to keep the window a little open for ventilation.

When i asked for some new hot food to be brought out it was received with a huge sigh and i can't be bothered look on their faces. I couldn't finish the breakfast as it was probably the worse i have ever tasted.

926,"I used to be a regular at the Ibis in Euston, I was really sad when that got closed as it had been my go to hotel in London when I needed to stay over. I like Ibis as a brand, the hotels aren't fancy, but they're usually clean, with comfortable beds and a lot of them have walk-in showers. I had a concert at the O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire and so I was pleased to see there was an Ibis conveniently close to both the venue and the Tube station. My room was very large, far larger than I've had in other Ibis hotels and it had laminate flooring rather than carpet. I thought that might make it noisier, but I didn't notice any noise from above during my stay, though that said, it was a Sunday night, so I doubt the hotel was full. There was the usual pod-style bathroom with the walk-in shower which you get in the more modern Ibis hotels. I like them, the shower floor is sloped just enough so the whole room doesn't get wet and the double doors make it easy getting in and out. The bed was comfortable and the temperature was fine. I appreciated being able to open the window as I like it to be cool at night. Given a choice that's the one improvement I'd make to the Ibis hotels - air conditioning. The system they use can't really cope in the summer when it gets hot, but they do at least usually have a fan available in the room which helps. I didn't stay for breakfast, but I did have a drink in the bar. They do Camden Town Brewery beer on tap, so you can get a decent pint there. All in all, it was pretty much what I expect from an Ibis, clean, comfortable and good value, the brand continues to live up to what I expect.","January 29, 2019","17    Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel

941,"Booked a London Package for our 20th anniversary and didn’t get to choose the accommodations. When we heard 2 weeks out that this was our Property, we were disappointed that it wasn’t located closer to Central London. BUT, it was a very close walk to the shepherd bush-Central Line station which made it more convenient. Many amenities close by as well, restaurants, pharmacy, shopping mall. The staff were all so friendly, the breakfast was an amazing start to each day - so much variety, great coffee & tea selection. If I return to London I will try to stay closer to the heart of the fun but if you don’t mind crazy busy subway stations, this is a decent choice. All in all LOVED LONDON!

943,"My wife and I normally stay here when in West London and have always had a very good experience, as have the relatives who have taken up out recommendation of staying here.Our last visit must have something to do with French revenge for the BREXIT campaign. Things had deteriorated since our last stay. My negative review has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the staff who were polite and extremely helpful.On entering our room, everything was as we expected, clean and tidy. A typical generic Ibis room. Immediately, we were hit by the overpowering smell of whatever the room was cleaned with. Was it a masking agent or just over zealous use of disinfectant? Because we were only staying one night and it was quite late we decided to brave it out. Terrible mistake. We couldn't sleep and we were left with only one option which was to open the window. The noise of the air-conditioning units and traffic certainly diluted the smell but the cost was a noisy and disturbed night. When we returned home our clothes wreaked of the disinfectant?? smell as did our suitcase. To add insult to injury, when we tried to make a coffee we found that our milk curdled the drink. Long life milk past its use by date? Just do not know because the date was not visible. Poor show!!We thought things would improve at breakfast but as my wife has an intolerance to wheat and is pre diabetic we knew that we would be able to have porridge (enthusiastically advertised in the hotel). Unfortunately, there is a standard price for breakfast, which would have made this as expensive as the porridge at he Savoy. Maybe.What a pity as our West London bolthole will need replaced by another. Rather galling as an Accors member.","October 21, 2018","17    Ibis London Shepherds Bush - Hammersmith Hotel

Just steps away from the Shepherds Bush tube station, which made it incredibly convenient for getting around London. We arrived a couple of hours before official check in time, but they were able to check us in early (which was very appreciated after a long flight). The room was bright and clean, a little small, but we knew to expect that in London. We had ample space for everything and were quite comfortable. After checking in we decided to walk around London (trying to stay awake to adjust to the time change). During our check in chat we happened to mention we were there to celebrate our 30th anniversary, when we returned to our room, later that day, we found heart balloons, rose petals on the bed, champagne flutes, a small bottle of sparkling wine and a very nice card. What a thoughtful gesture.We had a very pleasant stay here and found the staff incredibly friendly, room very nice, clean, bright and comfortable (although the mattress wasn't the most comfortable we had ever slept on).

There was spare room between the bedside tables and the actual beds. So you could see how a regular single bed could fit in there but instead they put like, I don't know, 70 cm wide beds? The rooms weren't really big either. If there's two of you, which was the case for me, one person had a place to put their suitcase but the other one just had to put it on top of the table. Next to the other person's bed. It just seems poorly planned. But there were many lil empty spots around the room, so we made it work.The staff were lovely though.

The lady at check in was friendly enough and the lady we redeemed our drink vouchers with was nice enough but the rest of the staff did not smile, did not greet you and seemed generally disinterested in anything. Breakfast which was always amazing was disappointing and sad. There was no bacon, no eggs, and the sausages were over cooked and the entire breakfast staff looked haggard and in a daze.

Room was excellent, breakfast acceptable (too crowded and noisy) and food was average. Service is not so good as receptionists also function as cleaning personnel for breakfast and guests pile up to checkin, checkout and ask questions, call a taxi, etc at the booth functioning as reception. Worse is that some receptionists DO NOT KNOW LONDON which is not acceptable. Having no idea about Victoria train station is unbelievable. Taxi company estimate given on the phone of a service to Victoria was 14 pounds, taxi driver wanted 22. the taxi called by the hotel did not have a meter so the driver can squeeze you. so, excellent room, good location but terrible service.

965,"The London Court Hotel is a quick 2 minute walk from the Earls Court Underground station (exit and go left). The registration process was quick. We booked this hotel for a 3 night stay, then decided to add a day at the beginning of our trip. I contacted the hotel and was about to keep the same room for all 4 nights. The hotel was quick to respond and take action.Upon arrival to our room, we noticed it was clean, modern, looked like the photos, and small (as to be expected). We were assigned room 307. As there is no lift, the climb to the top floor got old very quickly, and I found myself dreading the thought of returning to the room each day. There were coffee and tea making facilities in our room, a hair dryer, 2 USB ports, plenty of channels on the TV, and speedy free Wi-Fi. Some of the negatives: not enough hangers (we did not ask for additional); tiny waste bins; and the safe was locked (again, we did not request it be opened). There were no drawers for clothes storage, so I left my suitcase open and slid it under the bed to conserve space.Earls Court Road in that area is full of restaurants. There's a Nando's, McDonald's, Izzi (Italian), Prince of teck (pub), Pret, and Co Op (market) all on the short walk from the tube station.

No outside calls are permitted on the room phones. The safes are only large enough to store jewelry. This is inconvenient when traveling with laptops and such. My only option was to pack electronics and valuables in a suitcase and leave it in the reception area in plain view near the place guests can help themselves to coffee. I was assured it was perfectly safe there. It was either that or leave it in my room.

980,This gem is not too far from the underground station and lots of lovely restaurants and cafe’s nearby.Clean and very comfortable place.Highly recommend and this has been the best budget hotel I’ve been in the area.,"March 11, 2018","18    Brit Hotels London Court

981,"I have to admit that when I first found The London Court House on a booking website I was initially suspicious. The score was unusually high in terms of satisfaction and value for money, and yet the price per night - despite the additional factors of central location, close proximity to a tube station, and amenities in the room itself - was relatively low. Having been burnt before at other 'hotels,' I did my best to uncover the catch with no luck so I booked a room and crossed my fingers.When I arrived, I was more than pleasantly surprised and a little relieved. The only thing I could find to detract from the place was the stairs, which could have been an issue for older or impaired guests. There are no lifts and to reach the lobby or any guest rooms you have to climb a couple of flights of stairs. I arrived with several heavy bags, which the hotel staff kindly helped me with upon arriving and departing. In fact, the staff were wonderful and couldn't seem to do enough for me during my stay. They were endlessly friendly and pleasant, greeting me during my frequent comings and goings.The gentleman working on reception when I arrived kindly stored my bags in the reception until I could check in to allow me to explore London, then helped me to carry them to my room upon my return. The room itself was unusual but very comfortable. There were stairs from the doorway down to the room itself, which featured every expected amenity. There was a single (very comfortable!) bed, a television on the opposite wall, a small desk and chair, a wardrobe, small safe, a small fridge, a kettle and a good supply of tea and coffee. There was even a complimentary bottle of still water in the fridge every day once the room had been serviced. The bathroom was very modern and clean.I stayed for a total of three nights, and couldn't fault my stay! The location was very useful for comings and goings, there was no noise to speak of from other rooms or outside, the wi-fi was reliable and the staff, as I stated, were excellent. I would highly recommend this hidden gem and wouldn't hesitate to book with them again. Thank you for an enjoyable stay!","February 26, 2018","18    Brit Hotels London Court

982,"We loved this hotel and stayed there three nights. It was about 30 seconds walk from the Earls court tube station. Look left coming out the station and you'll see it. The rooms are small but really nicely decorated with great air conditioning/heating unit, safe, fridge, lovely bathroom and are absolutely spotless. Free bottles of water are provided everyday and there is free tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms and there is a nice coffee machine in reception which can be used any time. Yes it is up a good few steep stairs and obviously wouldn't suit anyone with mobility issues but otherwise, it's not a problem in that you're only bringing your cases up and down once and other than that would only go up and down them once or twice a day. But it actually makes it quieter as you're up off the main street, so it's not a bad thing! It doesn't have a bar or restaurant, it's only bedrooms but in London with so many places to eat, we wouldn't want to eat where we are staying anyway. The lady who did the cleaning was really nice and did a very good job but special mention has to go to the two gentlemen on reception. They were so nice and helpful and couldn't have done more. We used to get a little wave every time we passed reception. It really made us feel at home! They really are a great asset to the hotel. We will definitely stay there next time we're in London.","January 20, 2018","18    Brit Hotels London Court

985,"London Court Hotel is located a mere 1 minute's walk from Earl's Court station - wonderful location. The station itself hosts both the Piccadilly and District lines, which are already sufficient for getting to most places. When exiting the station, head left and you'll pass Co-op, Nando's and Costa before arriving at the hotel. The hotel entrance is easy to miss since there is no frontage beyond a single door. If you see Starbucks, you've missed it and should double back.A word of caution though, the hotel has no lifts and you'll need to drag your luggage up several flights of stairs. This should not be a problem for most, but is still good to know in advance.The room was very comfortable and there was generally ample room. The bathroom was reasonably sized as well. The only drawback to this hotel was the poor condition of the beds; they were far too soft.All things considered, an excellent choice if you just need a convenient place to base yourself for exploring London.

There are a number of places to eat and drink around the hotel as well as local supermarkets. The two pubs we went to near by were friendly and had great service. The gentlemen of reception was incredibly welcoming. I asked via email if we could check in early as we had to change before SW4, and he got the room ready early for us at no extra cost. A fancy room at a reasonable price. Much fancier than any other room I've stayed in in London for the same price. Two things to note - lots of stairs and no lift, so it is not suitable for people who can't access stairs. Also, the bar is alcohol free (but the pub over the road is neat)","September 12, 2017","18    Brit Hotels London Court

I will talk about accessibility next.This establishment has no guest elevators and is not meant for families with strollers (unless you collapse it at the front door and carry it up along with the kid) or guests with physical disability as it is a stairmasters routine to maneuver around.

Love the location of the hotel, you can see many coffee shops and restaurant surrounding the hotel, Nando's, local burgers, starbucks, also some pubs at the corner. Almost everything opens until pretty late, so it was good for our hungry tummy after a long flight.But for some reason, might have missed the details about the hotel when i read the review. Once we enter the hotel we were pretty surprised that there was no lift, while the 2 of us were bringing 3 baggages (due to last minutes packing, we just chuck everything we had for winter) haha anyway the receptionist is located on the 1st floor, very kind guy saying that he will bring all of our baggage up, still we feel bad so we also carry the bags up.After registration and all, we finally get our room.. on the 3rd floor. We didnt think that we have more energy to go all the way up to the 3rd floor with all of the bags. So we decided to leave the big bags at the reception and take whatever we need to the room. Coffee machine is located at the receptionist and its open 24 hours a day. The room is nice, nice comfy double bed and proper bath room, overlooking the pretty busy earls court rd since it was saturday night. Another + point is that its located 3 mins away from the tube.

1011,"Firstly it is what it is. It's a cheap, no frills hotel in a decent neighbourhood in the centre of one of the most expensive cities in the world, so you set your expectations accordingly.I needed a one night stay for a business trip knowing I'd get in there early evening and be gone by early morning and for £68 it did the job.I booked a single room with shared bathroom so was a bit apprehensive about what to expect but the room was adequate, it was at the back of the hotel so no road noise and the bathroom was up a couple of flights of short steps, taking me about five seconds to get there so it wasn't an issue. The shared bathroom is key controlled so it's not as if everyone could use it and you shared it with one other single room user. Lots of places to eat right outside the hotel, some nice pubs over the road and the tube stop was about 30 yards away. Only negative was the carpet was a bit grubby and had seen better days so I didn't take my socks off but for the money it did the job and I'd use it again if I needed a short stay.","December 5, 2016","18    Brit Hotels London Court

1014,"London Court Hotel is a boutique hotel situated in the heart of Earls Court. This is the best hotel I have stay in London and probably newly build. It is conveniently located just 2-3 minutes walk from the Earls Court tube station in Zone 1 London and near restaurants (kebabs, Nandos, wagamama, masala zone, Mc Donald's, Burger King, KFC, Subway, Chinese, Thai and Indian Food etc) even the supermarkets and Boots and just minutes walk away. When coming from the airport, it's the first stop in London Zone 1 (Earls Court Tube Station - and it's the station with a lift so you don't have to carry your bags through massive flight of stairs ) Earls Court is a convenient location in London and accessible to all major tourist attractions nAside from the perfect location, they have the most hospitable staff. Thumbs up to both Ali and William!! (A job well done, you make my stay a memorable one) I was totally smitten by their warm welcome (early check in/assistance with my luggage to the room) and their assistance throughout my trip. You would notice that the staff in the hotel are genuine people rather than putting up a front and they would go out of the way to assist you . Being a frequent traveller to London and staying in Earls Court area most of the time, you will never get such service or even such good/clean room in other hotels around the area. (Some hotels around that area even charge you £5 pounds just to keep your luggage ) Hence their great reviews. I have listed out the points, hope this helps you :) 1. My room was well lit and the place was properly used. Toilet Amenities was great and the bed was extremely comfortable. There is also an air condition in the room, so you would not feel stuffy. 2. The place looks and smells cozy!! Like your home. 3. The staff are well trained (even the Housekeeping staff are extremely professional, polite and do a great job to make your stay even more comfortable - having your free bottles of water in the fridge. 4.

1023,"This was our third visit to the Mad Hatter in London. Previously we had been delighted by the friendliness and efficiency of the staff which coupled with the location, relaxed bar and parking within walking distance meant that we were happy repeat customers. This time it was not so relaxing and the reason for this lies primarily with the evening bar staff.As has been pointed out by other reviewers the rooms are starting to look tired and will hopefully be up for a refurb very soon. We like the Fullers model and are also frequent visitors to another Fullers hotel/pub but this one seems to be facing some challenges. The room we stayed in this time clearly had some cleaning issues as the ceiling fan was coated with dust, a fairly thick layer, and there was further dust which had collected on one of the walls however any shortcomings in the standard of the rooms had always been outweighed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and this is still in evidence as we were dealt with efficiently and professionally at check-in despite arriving early. We like to arrive early so that we can have a pub lunch in the bar and as usual we did this and staff were attentive and proficient. No problems there. Later, as we left the hotel for the evening, we did what we had done previously and handed our order for breakfast in the room to the receptionist. The hotel advertises breakfast in your room at no extra charge but does not make it easy to do so with no actual breakfast menu in the room and no form to fill in. Nevertheless I had written it clearly on a piece of paper. The receptionist, who was notably dressed down in jeans and tee-shirt, seemed confused but promised to get it to the kitchen. We were going out to a show and another reason we like this hotel is that after the show we like to come back to the pub and have a relaxing drink and to wind down before going to bed. This time the bar was far from relaxing. Bar staff were loud, unprofessional and scruffily dressed. They clearly didn't want to be there, wanted to get home and regarded customers as an inconvenience. We know because we heard them telling each other so. They also stood outside one of the fire exits smoking whilst another used the disabled toilet for a very long time keeping my disabled friend waiting and not even offering a 'sorry' on exit. We felt that all of this was unprofessional and definitely not welcoming or relaxing and for this reason we will be looking at other hotels in the area and comparing with the Mad Hatter before our next visit to London. That's the simple effect that unprofessional staff can have on your business!We did get that breakfast in our room but only after a call to our room querying whether we did actually want it in the room which suggested that communication between reception and kitchen may not have taken place as it should have. Most hotels have a card which can be filled in and put outside your door, why not this one? Also it would be good practice to use plate cloches to keep the food warm, something I have flagged up before, but which are not in use at the Mad Hatter.","May 27, 2019","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

1024,"Staying in Central London for only 159GBP a night is great. And this hotel is wonderfully located, near two tube stops, with easy access to just about all the tourist sights, in a decent area. The staff is friendly, the breakfast is good (and can be had for 10GBP with advanced notice as a guest), and the rooms are spacious for London at this price. However, there are a few things that need improving. The climate control is minimal, which would not be a problem in the winter, but the room was hot and stuffy when the outside temps were in the upper 60s F in May. The cleaning products used were very strong smelling. And with the windows open (to deal with the heat) it was very noisy at night.There was a small issue with the bill - nothing huge, just some minor account tracking issues, which was handled appropriately by the staff. Overall, I'm happy with the choice for 7 nights in May. But a few small changes would make a world of difference.","May 26, 2019","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

Indeed as a regular tourist to London these are two things which I actively seek out and so came across this place like an oasis in the desert. Its a nice looking bar as you would expect from Fullers. There it sadly stops. The bar could do with a good clean, the food was average at best but the staff were unfortunately lazy and simply disinterested in serving. My recommendation is to go round the corner to Doggets.","May 14, 2019","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

We planned to just drop our bags, so getting into our room was a huge plus). The included mini-bar and the coffee / tea was fab, we loved the Dyson heater to warm ourselves up after exploring the rest of the afternoon, and the room itself was big enough for two females getting ready with two big bags - plenty of space to throw things around and illuminated mirror area to do hair and makeup. We only stayed for a night before continuing to other cities in the UK, but I would return again without hesitation. Additionally, we stored our bags with the front desk for the rest of the day after checking out because our train wasn't until the evening. We were slightly concerned because there were a lot of bags just sitting around - granted all labeled, but not stored in a room or kept away from the public. We returned and all our stuff was there, no issues, but our one suggestion would have been to have a more organized / tucked away luggage storage system.","February 12, 2019","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

1035,"My partner and I stayed for our anniversary in January 2019. Upon arrival, it was so close to Blackfriars bridge and the tube station with a little Waitrose opposite which was handy. When walking in there was a foul smell in between the front door and the 2 doors for the pub or hotel everytime we walked through to leave or come back. The lady on the checkout didn’t give us any information about when check out was and didn’t seem to be interested in the fact we were even there, as 2 people that have worked in hospitality for many years it was the beginning of undertrained staff. When walking to the room everything felt rather dated and didn’t look as retro-modern as the pictures had led us to believe, sacks of dirty linen were stacked in the hallways, reassuring everything was clean but not the nicest to walk through. The room itself was very clean with a lovely stocked mini fridge that was free for the duration of our stay, probably the highlight of our stay, a really nice addition. The view from the room wasn’t the nicest, basically a dirt pit building site but not the hotels fault obviously. We saw a lovely 3 course veganuary menu in the room we were excited to try in their pub downstairs, with myself having a disability we felt it’d be easier to stay on site. We went downstairs to the pub and saw the cocktails were on from 5pm-7pm Monday to Thursday however when ordering one the bartender said they didn’t serve them after 5pm during the week, the exact opposite of what was advertised in the menu, blackboard, sign outside... basically felt that he didn’t want to make one. We were then told we could sit at a table that felt we were intruding on a private function and saw the veganuary specials board only had 1 meal on out of the 6 starters and mains that were on the website and menus on the tables and in our room. We wanted to be able to have more of a choice and more than one course for our anniversary so decided we should probably start searching else where. We came back to the room after dinner and went to sleep. The next morning I was woken up to knocking on the door several times by the time I was able to get out of bed no one was there. We rang the front desk to double check the check out time as it wasn’t on the welcome letter either. After checking out, we went to our prepaid breakfast in the pub at 10.20am, it stated everywhere that breakfast ended at 11am however when we arrived the continental breakfast had been put away, tea, coffee, juices, everything put away. One of the waitresses rolled her eyes when she saw us walk in which then made me feel really bad but as we’d already paid when booking, we weren’t going to miss the food. We ordered 2 vegetarian breakfasts, my partner asked for a tea, we weren’t offered any drinks or anything else at all so I didn’t ask for a drink as I felt guilty being there and everything had been packed away, luckily I had some water in my bag. The breakfast came, and we shouldn’t have been surprised it wasn’t great, the hash browns were really oily and the veggie sausage had a really odd, strong, not appealing taste to it, I left it and my boyfriend with a stomach of steal felt ill for the rest of the day. Honestly, I was really looking forward to staying at the mad hatter, it looks like a really nice homely pub and B&B but, the staff let it down more than anything. Uninterested is what I’d describe the service as, not wanting to adhere to any promotions advertised ie. cocktails, breakfast end time, standard check in info. I’ve never felt like I needed to write a review before but honestly, if this was my place of work I’d want to know how bad the customer service was. I hope this helps enable staff to not ruin anyone else’s stay or special occasion. I’ve rated 3/5 down to cleanliness and general special touches alone.","February 8, 2019","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

Added bonus is the mini bar is always full and free! There was also free tea/coffee and biscuits in the room. The bathroom was lovely and fully stocked with hand soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and those great little emergency sets ie sewing kit.

1040,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a night to celebrate our 4 year anniversary (we went for lunch at Bob Bob Ricard & to the theatre to see Lés Misérables so thought we’d go the whole hog and stay the night too!). It was absolutely BRILLIANT. After scrolling through endless overpriced hotel rooms on booking.com with photos of terrible decor and rooms without windows (...really?!!), I was a little apprehensive about our stay in the city. My boyfriend emailed them in advance to say it was our anniversary after seeing them asking guests to let them know if they are celebrating a special occasion and they went out of their way to decorate our room. There were balloons, special pillows, faux rose petals and even a free bottle of prosecco on ice waiting for us which was absolutely incredible and very generous!! The minibar is also complimentary for the first night for all guests which is stocked full of various drinks (including beer!) plus a great selection of coffee (with a special cafetière alongside the kettle) and even hot chocolate. I find this amazing and again, very generous of the hotel to provide all of these things free of charge to their guests. We arrived an hour and a half early before the check in time and asked if there was any chance we could check in early and they were more than happy to help, the manager calling the housekeepers to ask and in the meantime asking if we’d like to store our luggage with them at the reception. We had a drink at the bar, being served by a young friendly barman (the bar is stunning with the most fun, cosy booths, Alice in Wonderland themed touches and house plants), before going to our room early after being given the go ahead from the housekeepers. The room was a lovely size with a large, bright window and a bath which I took full advantage of the next morning! We explored the city for the day and returned after 11pm, buzzing to be let in by the night porter as instructed earlier that day who was very friendly and helped us with our query regarding where to find late night food in the area. The hotel is in a great location just a few minutes walk from the tube station. We ended up getting a taxi home from Covent Garden and it didn’t cost much at all as it’s so close to the action! We had a good night sleep at the hotel although the road outside was quite noisy - though this is to be expected in the capital and easily handled with some comfortable ear plugs. My only suggestion would be to perhaps provide bubble bath for the rooms with bath tubs even for a fee (I attempted to use the shower gel provided to create bubbles which didn’t last very long so this would have been a great option for me). This was an amazing hotel and if we return to London for a night in the future we will definitely stay here again unless we decide splash out on a swanky five star option just for the experience. This has become our go-to hotel for sure!","January 31, 2019","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

Seriously, how long does it take to make scrambled eggs, heat up beans, and fry some bacon? The pancakes weren't homemade but rather were just reheated from the freezer section...so why did it take so long?? The pub wasn't even busy --there were three other tables. I wanted a latte but the waiter said that he'd bring us coffee. ?! Coffee wasn't anything to write home about. We asked where our food was at one point, and the waitress told us that we had to wait because there were other tables in front of us. ???! I'm a loss for words.

Paid upfront extra for breakfast which was good, lots of choices. I had a room on the first floor; being above a pub there was some noise one night, but it was over by 11pm (closing time). Yes, there was some construction noise as building is going on behind the hotel but again, they knocked off by 4pm each day, so again no bother to me. Selection of free booze in the room fridge appreciated. Would definitely stay again.","December 30, 2018","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

Then we ordered a Sunday roast, their specialty, oh not on tonight!! Why? no explanation. VERY disappointed. So we ordered fish and chips with mushy peas. The peas had died....fish in batter ok rest chips etc cold! Not good. Chicken tikka masala pie very average. Not our night!Will definitely NOT have a meal here again. So poor.

1047,"For the same price as a budget chain hotel room you can get a room here and experience a more intimate London hotel experience. My room was big, very well equipped and even had a FREE mini bar (yes, non alcoholic, but still free). Comfortable big rooms and a great location (provided you want to be near Waterloo or Southwark). The restaurant downstairs was quiet and therefore lacked a bit of atmosphere but I think it's still a great alternative to bigger and much more expensive hotels in London.","December 10, 2018","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

She was absolutely superb from the moment she came to our table.First thing she did was to unreservedly apologise without offering the usual excuses. Then she asked what she could do to resolve the situation, listened to all that we had to say and came up with a resolution instantly.I must compliment Rachel and her team for fantastic food, tasty beer and wine on what was obviously an extremely busy evening in the bar.Our room was light, airy and spacious and the bed was very comfortable.We enjoyed a delicious breakfast before checking out the following morning.We will definitely recommend The Mad Hatter to friends and, will definitely be staying there again.","November 30, 2018","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

It's a small hotel just a few minutes from Southwark Tube and walking distance to Waterloo. This makes it very accessible from Gatwick or London City Airport. Double room was good, comfortable bed with a small bathroom. The phone is a mock old style model, quiely! In a rather nice touch, everything in the mini-bar is free - a London Pride (it's a Fuller's Hotel), a cider, selection of soft drinks and water.

1053,"Stayed there for a week; the room was clean. The water was hot. The minimal interaction with the staff was perfectly adequate. Location is great; short walk to the Underground. Noise-It's a big city, so it's going to be noisy. That being said there is a high probability the when the construction starts on the surrounding lot(s) that noise will be an issue. I would verify with the front desk before making reservations. As with all older buildings in London, there is no air conditioning, and at this time of year it wasn't a problem, but I would hesitate to stay here in the summer. Note: When you walk out the front door pause for a moment and look at about your 1 o'clock....you'll have a great view of St. Pauls from the front door of the property. The pub, like pretty much every pub/restaurant we ate at, did struggle with customer service. Not sure why that is, but it's not unique to the pub at the property.

1063,"Stayed one night at the Mad Hatter which I selected due to its location, very close to meetings the next day. I was absolutely impressed! Everything was perfect and designed to make the guest feel welcome and pampered. Check-in with Nikki at reception was peasant - she was very friendly and helpful. My room was large and the bed was high with a mattress you could drown in- super comfortable and lots of pillows. Shower was great and very hot water. Tea and coffee (and biscuits) provided and also a mini bar stocked with a selection of soft drinks - all complementary!! Cant ever remember staying at a hotel with a free minibar! Bathroom large and well appointed. Hairdryer (real one, not those small ones that don't blow hot) and iron and ironing board, and mini-safe in the room. Inside chain bolt on the room for extra security. All really nice and tastefully decorated. Very clean.Breakfast the next morning was no less enjoyable - super-friendly waitress offered us cooked options and a selection of cereals, cheeses, toast etc were available from the buffet. All excellent. Pricing for the Mad Hatter is very reasonable for a central London hotel. Unfortunately I didn't have time to eat in the pub - the meals looked fantastic but I was there for just a short stay. I will certainly return if I get the chance - will even go a little out of my way to stay here in future even if my meetings are not so close by - it's worth it!","October 20, 2018","19    The Mad Hatter Hotel

1067,"To be honest I only booked this hotel purely because of the proximity to the venue I needed to be at in the evening. It is literally 2 minutes from Blackfriars Bridge train station. However....Now we have stayed here, we will definitely be back. Ideal for a quick overnight in the nicer weather and a stroll along the Thames which we have planned.Easy checking in. I had already paid in advance and rang to see if we could have a fan in our room ....which was done...thank you. The bedroom is not the biggest but certainly ample space for one night. The bed and pillows were uber soft and comfortable. The bath was just the right size for a shorty ( me!) to relax in. Hot water was spit on heat too. Himself used the shower and said that was good too.Lots of little nice touches in the room. Complimentary drinks, plenty of tea bags, a cafetiere of coffee ( ) and biscuits too.Breakfast was reasonable priced as was supper the night before. It's seems to be a very busy and popular pub / hotel. My only comment would be the lack of bar staff on a Friday night left us waiting for ages to be served and ages to get the drinks. Prices not too bad really but a great pint of London Pride....apparently himself said. Our friends stayed here with us too. All in all a successful evening. Thank you.

On arrival at the check-in desk, the staff appeared to be very busy and it took a while to get our room key, and there was no sign of the supposed 'complimentary warm chocolate chip cookie'. Our room was adequate in size, albeit only for a one or two nights stay and it was a bit of a squeeze to access the wardrobe. Nevertheless the beds were quite comfortable and the room was quiet. However, the biggest letdown was the breakfast in the morning, which is served in an airless subterranean space which is clearly far too small to adequately accommodate the numbers that were endeavouring to eat there. i would have raised this issue with the staff when I checked-out but no-one enquired as to whether we had enjoyed our stay.

It's the only hotel I've ever stayed at where you can make fresh orange juice by putting the orange in a squeezer. Can't recommend this place enough.","May 20, 2019","20    DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich

1097,I am a long-standing Hilton customer and this was probably the worst stay in a long time. Rarely write reviews as repeat business is how I prefer to repay good service. I am a diamond member and so would expect my stay preferences on the system to be considered. Instead I got a ground floor room behind the bar. People were smoking outside the room which still managed to come in through a closed window. Woken at 11pm by the fire alarm (not mentioned at checkout). Woken again after that by noisy guests in the room next door through paper thin walls. Breakfast terrible - hot food was cold. Not asked how my stay was at checkout (when I would have gladly told them all this). All in all an absolute shocker and will not use this hotel again. ,"March 27, 2019","20    DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich

It started with Alice, who greeted us on arrival and introduced us to the hotel and continued at every touchpoint. Thank you team!! We had a light meal in the bar and it was value for money and good to eat (both were salads). My husband was delighted that the kitchen remembered to put anchovies on the Cesar Salad. Our room - a standard king - was comfortable and had all you would expect. I would have no hesitation returning to this hotel but would mention that if you prefer to sleep with your window open look for a room with even numbers as those with odd ones look out over the air-conditioning bank which makes for a constant rumble (only with the window open).","March 24, 2019","20    DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich

1101,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights based on a recommendation by family that had previously stayed on an earlier trip some years ago when it was a Hampton or Hilton. Based on American standards, I found the room to be rather small. However, it did offer a king-size bed which was not always available at other London Hilton-brand hotels. There was a small sitting area when entering the room, but we did not use that other than for storage. The bathroom was clean and nice - toilet worked well and the water pressure for the shower was very good. The bed was comfortable. Storage space is limited and you'll probably end up storing luggage under the desk or in the sitting area if you have much of it.My one minor complaint with the hotel room was that it had no bedside outlets. I use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, but did not find a place to plug it in. Only one of the three or four outlets would not accept my power converter. The outlet at the desk was the only one that would accept a power converter. However, there were some bedside USB ports which I used at night to keep my phone charged.This hotel is not centrally located to the major London attractions, but it is a short 5 minute walk to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and was significantly less expensive (£30+) than other more centrally located Hilton properties. I think the benefit to this hotel is that it seems to be situated in a part of London that one would call ""real life"" - a non-tourist part of London where Londoners live, work and commute. We ate at a great pub (The North Pole) that was about a 5 or 6 minute walk away.We ate room service the first night as we got to the hotel around 11pm. Only cold sandwiches were available and we had to take what was available. Our last night we ate one night in the restaurant and the food was OK, but didn't find it great. However, one afternoon we had creamed tea and it was very good.If you want local atmosphere, this is a great place in my opinion.","March 14, 2019","20    DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich

1107,"I am diamond member at Hilton and I generally associate the doubletree brand with large spacious rooms, big lobbies etc. This property was however more like an autograph collection from Marriott. It appeared to be an older hotel converted to a doubletree (did not check out the details). It’s tucked away in a residential area so hard to spot from the roadside. A very small lobby and similarly small rooms though well appointed. Breakfast was typical British. It’s in a basement and the tables are all crammed up so did not get a grand feeling and you want to just get it done with quickly. I was disappointed with the laundry service as my suit came back not dry cleaned properly. However I just mentioned this while checking out and they waived away the laundry charges.

The room was phenomenal. 9th floor, amazing view, beautifully decorated. I slept like a baby and never heard anyone else in the hotel. The shower, though gorgeous with 4 shower heads and a partial glass door was my only complaint. The over head showerhead had very light pressure and all four on together soaked the wall, door, and floor. Very impressive to look at, just not functional. The breakfast was very nice.

1117,"I'm a frequent Hilton guest (diamond status) and I booked this hotel because it was convenient in terms of location and price on my dates. I don't normally book Doubletree, preferring Hiltons, but figured I'd give it a shot.First, the hotel is amazing in terms of appearance - it was an old police station and then a private boutique hotel, and then finally became a Doubletree.Second, the rooms are incredibly modern (probably the most I've seen - and I've stayed at the Conrad in London/St. James 3 times), and while not huge, well laid out and well decorated (there was the history of the crown on the bathroom glass door - really interesting to read!).Finally - the dining room and the bar are the best! Super stylish and well appointed.Service from check-in to bar to check-out were top notch (with one exception - you have to spin a stupid wheel and you win a 'prize' (a free drink, some points, etc.) - kind of takes the class of the hotel down in my opinion to have to do that - just give me a random allocation if you want to do that I guess). The only negative was the location to transport - it was 2 blocks from one and 4 blocks from another one, so not terrible but this isn't the tube, it's the DLR (which means you have to connect), so I took Uber twice because I didn't want to walk.","January 30, 2019","20    DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich

Staff really friendly and helpful. Nice touch with yummie warm cookie on check-out. Only downsides: Noisy aircon, which we had to switch off; Gin & Tonics were £7.50 each, though they did do a quite good value Pre-Show Meal including 2 courses and a drink for £19.99. Didn't check out the gym. Will be back again!","January 13, 2019","20    DoubleTree by Hilton London Greenwich

1123,Great refurbished hotel. Was a little concerned that it was a bit far away from central London but the tube was good to Leyton. As we arrived late we got an Uber from tube to hotel but the following morning we caught a bus from across the road back to the station - nice and convenient.The staff at the hotel were very welcoming. Unfortunately due to our schedule we didn’t get to try the food. However it looked good and the menu will tempt us back.We booked through Secret Escapes making this a great value break in a comfortable hotel!,"June 29, 2019","21    The Lion & Key Hotel

1124,"Having lived locally for two years, the Lion & Key is my go-to establishment for a drink or dinner. Management are wonderfully friendly and staff are great - they really look after you. The menu is great - freshly cooked grills, burgers, pizza and salads, and their bar is well stocked. I pop in at least every few weeks on my own or with a friend, and they regularly give free starters/ or dessert if we dine. I have also stayed once at the hotel, which can't be faulted for the very reasonable price. Good sized, clean rooms and I am sure if any problems occurred they would be dealt with fantastically. I feel very lucky to have this on my doorstep and this review is long overdue! Thank you Lion & Key.","June 27, 2019","21    The Lion & Key Hotel

1127,"I had to decamp from my flat to the nearest hotel one night after being locked out in circumstances that are hilarious to look back on now, but the outcome was that I arrived at the Lion and Key in something of a state and had little expectation of the facilities. I was, therefore, very surprised to find one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed in, and certainly the best for its price category. The hotel opened very recently so everything is new and in the modern minimalist style. I happen to be super into stone effect and grey wood panelling, so this was great. Everything was clean. The hotel contains a restaurant that provided complimentary room service, which is ridiculous and amazing. There is an internal intranet on the TV. The bed is memory foam and awesome and the bathroom was spotless and stocked with the little gels. The staff were discreet and did not bother me when I needed them, if you know what I mean. I spent my night drinking my complimentary tea, eating my dinner from my complimentary room serviced tray, and watching BBC Parliament. I had such a great night. Honestly, I only live just down the road but have seriously considered just coming and staying again. Very highly recommended.","May 16, 2019","21    The Lion & Key Hotel

First of all, the staff is extremely polite and kind indeed we arrived out of the check-in time and they made it anyway offering us some fruit because we didn't have dinner. The room and bathroom were warm, elegant and big enough for those who stay outside all day long. The room was cleaned and the bed sheets were changed each morning, making the atmosphere comfy and pleasant. The zone is ok, 10 minutes from the metro station on foot.

The room was well equipped, a decent size and nice and clean and comfortable. Surprisingly for a hotel on a main road it wasn't noisy and sleep quality was good.The food was of a good quality and reasonably priced. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. One key issue is that of parking. I paid £30 to park in the hotel car park whilst I stayed. The car par is very small and getting in and out can be a bit of a faff, however be advised local parking is an issue so if you can arrange parking do so.","November 26, 2018","21    The Lion & Key Hotel

1136,"A really nice modern (recently refurbished) hotel. It has been converted from a pub and retains a nice bar/restaurant downstairs. The rooms are very clean, modern and everything works. They are large, by London standards. Bathrooms are equally clean and modern. The restaurant is great as well. Clean and spacious. The food is good, good value and plentiful, you won’t go hungry here. The staff were polite and particularly the restaurant staff were friendly. My only very slight issue is that the reception staff were a little brusque. A more chatty warm welcome would have been nice. The other thing to watch is that they need a form of ID when checking in. Quite why this is needed is not clear to me as no other hotel insists on it. The final drawback is that the hotel is a bit off the beaten track. It’s a good 10-15 min walk from Leyton Tube station. And the area of Leyton itself is a bit rough. But all in all it’s. nice modern good value and clean hotel that I will use again.","November 7, 2018","21    The Lion & Key Hotel

The hotel itself was friendly and welcoming. The reception was clean and well presented. The room was modern with a great bathroom and shower, plenty of plug sockets (usually an issue) and the usual faculties in the room. Everything worked perfectly and there were no issues at all.

This independent hotel was booked as working less than a mile away but didn’t expect too much in this part if town.Reception were helpful and efficient. Limited parking in a secure courtyard was a little expensive at £15 but street parking locally is probably difficult.Small but tidy room finished to a very high standard with reasonable free internet and freeview.After a couple drinks in the bar we ventured out to eat. Bad move. The whole street apart from this hotel is alcohol free restaurants!So back to the hotel for food.

Arival to te room I was happy enough with the room at such short notice small but neat clean and tidy, though my room faced the High Street the double glazing worked well the air conditoning worked well as it was quite hot, the bar I found at £6 was decently priced, so I actually used it for a changed, I had requested two extra pillows which were already provided in the room, so I had no need to ask again which happens for me regularly, anyway my short stay went well, I would definately recommend a short stay there but alas if I was to be honest, I aquired the room on a cut price deal, on review I have seen it's true price and feel this is far over the top in prices, and would only recommend staying there when the deal is right !!","September 29, 2018","21    The Lion & Key Hotel

The bed was comfortable enough but not luxurious and the same could be said for the shower room which was certainly no bigger than was necessary. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on the quality of that but it was at least £10 per head which would make b and b for 2 pushing £160 which is not great value.

1144,"I have lived in this area for a number of years. The Lion & Key is a welcome addition to the area because there is little or anything decent within the area. The hotel is a very small modern hotel. I got in very late in the evening time. I got dinner in the restaurant area which was ok but there are better alternatives in Leyton if you are around earlier in the evening. The 2 nights I stayed while going to see family relations were cheap compared to normal hotel accomodation in London. The room was lovely. Both bedroom and bathroom were clean and well equipped. One big word of advise though. If you are a light sleeper who finds it difficult to sleep with noisy traffic outside, bring earplugs. This is a area where there is a lot of traffic and the windows and curtain in my room were in my honest opinion poor and inadequate for the area in question and need replacing.

Once you have gone past the warm welcome from reception that has a good open clean decor, you will take the lift to your room.A great sign for a good hotel is cleanliness and sharp chic design. This the hotel has in abundance. Moving to the room. It is spacious modern with an inviting bed and the essentials required for your stay. The TV provides hotel information along with your standard Freeview channels.The bathroom is immaculate with lovely marble and an excellent shower. The only negative point is having to leave. It is reasonably priced and can be reserved at lower prices if caught in time. Another plus point is the cafe, bar and grill alongside with a friendly front of the house manager. Service is fast and the food well presented. This is the gem of East London without a doubt and certainly the number one choice for the price. If you are in the area there is no better choice.

1164,"The Lion and Key has a major strength and that is the quality of its staff. Friendly from check in to check out and at all levels of staff. The place is very clean and seems well maintained. However there is nowhere in the bathroom to put make up and other toiletries even whilst in use. This includes nowhere in the shower to put soap, shampoo etc whilst showering, so a wash bag roll which you can hang on the back of the door would be very handy! I felt the rooms were designed for a man by a man since to make matters worse there is no full length mirror! But given the excellent price we paid and the super obliging staff these were only minor niggles. This was an excellent base for us to visited relatives in Leyton, it is not in a pretty location and the area may feel rather rough after dark if you are not used to urban areas although we walked everywhere or used cabs and at no time felt worried. We will definitely return...with our hanging wash bag! ","January 31, 2018","21    The Lion & Key Hotel

I was in London for 8 nights (my first time in the winter) and was lucky enough to find this little jewel. The staff was always friendly and helpful. True, it is not in a touristy area, but I walked around the area and the short distance to the underground station, day and night, without any hint of problem. There are a variety of bars and restaurants in the vicinity. My room was quiet, cleaned daily, and larger than many I've had in Europe. The bar and restaurant we're quite good also, both affordable and good. I left sad to leave, and I don't always have that feeling.

The rooms are spotless and all new beds, bathrooms and fitting. A great place for a budget price. The Lion & Key is an old Victorian building steeped in history which the current owners are respectful to observe. The name may be hard to remember but they didn't want to compromise the history - think Lion King holding the keys - and look out for the lions holding the keys in their mouths protection and the gatekeeper of heaven all around the hotel. There is a small car park, you probably have to book it but we use the tube (3 mins walk to Leyton tube) or the very frequent buses into town. The restaurant is modern & comfortable with a great menu for breakfast, lunch or supper - we love the speciality 'Pide' stuffed breads, they are huge.

1188,"I stayed at The Captain Cook on a Monday night in November on my way through London, and it was an excellent stay. From Heathrow, I took the Tube (Piccadilly Line) to the bus (211), which stops very close to the pub (150 meters or so). The trip took about 50 minutes, including transfer at Hammersmith Bus Station. Arrived early (12:30), which was not a problem at all. Walked into the pub and greeted warmly by the barman, who escorted me straightaway upstairs to my room. I had booked the superior deluxe room, which was more than large enough. Very clean, well-appointed with comfortable bed and adequate bathroom facilities en suite. The wifi was a little spotty, but not a huge problem. I was a little worried about that there would be a lot of noise from the street as the room overlooked Dawes Road, which is fairly busy, but this turned out not to be a problem. As it was a Monday night, the pub was quiet as well; I did not go there for food/drink. I plan to return soon, and will grab a pint downstairs this time.All in all a very good stay, and although I had limited interaction with the staff, it was quite positive. I'm also a big fan of the Fulham neighborhood, as it's convenient to Heathrow but not smack in the middle of the tourist area of London.

We were instantly seated, welcomed warmly and then a member of staff came over to explain that we are eligible for a 90 minute free flowing prosecco brunch. For the price of the deal, we were worried (but accepted) that we would have a very limited menu but we were offered a pastry and then a variety of breakfast choices or hearty main meals. The staff were attentive and were constantly topping up glasses when they saw they were at the half way point. The food was lovely-I had a fresh, almond pastry and a full English, which was DELICIOUS. I would recommend Caprqin Cook to family and friends and I would definitely go back for their prosecco brunch-with or without a great deal. ","July 30, 2017","22    The Captain Cook

I posted for another Pub hotel stay after my last stop at the Malt House.The manager was helpful and shoed me to my room, Very nice room, looks new and was very comfy. Bed was good and the desk was large and internet fast, I had a lot of work to catch up on after being in Italy with no WIFI. Google maps clocks this place as 11-18min walk to fulham broadway, it also takes you the long way around i think. found a few back street options off the North road.They didn't offer breakfast, they did offer a 10% discount at a place 5min away. i walked passed it one day and it didn't look very inviting. Went to shot in Fulham instead.Check out was a little annoying. My flight wasn't till 930 pm i wanted to leave bags at the hotel somewhere and grab them later in the day.Unfortunately check out is at 1030am and no-one is actually on site till 12pm. i was told if packed a bag of things i needed for the next day i could i leave my bag in the bar over night and and collect it next day when i was ready. This wasn't very convenient.i ended up taking my bag to paddington station and leaving in there locker system for 12 pounds for the day, that would i could just jump on the heathow express and not worry about the tube traffic.That and breakfast probably the only 2 minor problems i had at the captain cook. other wise its a great place stay.Bus stops out the front too which head in every direction.","July 28, 2017","22    The Captain Cook

1197,"The Captain Cook is a lovely place to stay. Fulham is a nice neighborhood with nearby choices for food and drink, and there's a large tube station within a 10 min walk (Fulham Broadway) that has a large shopping center in it. The nearby businesses mostly operate during business hours do there are not a lot of people around at night, and it's a quiet neighborhood. The hotel room was very clean, but smaller than I was expecting because they don't provide pics of all the rooms, just the biggest ones. We had an ensuite room that was smaller than expected. It would be nice if they showed all the room layouts so you know what you are getting. Also, if you cannot do stairs, you won't be able to stay here. All the rooms are up at least 1 flight of narrow windy stairs. But they will take your bags up and down for you. That was nice. One last heads up, they fill the water tanks on the coffee and tea makers so they're ready to go for you. But they don't always clean them first and you have no way to know when it was last filled. I thought they just had hard water when I saw the coffee water was murky, but after dumping it out, found a good deal of slime at the bottom of the tank. We had to wash the tank out and ran a few rounds of just hot water through the machine before we could use it. Then the water was much clearer. Just something to keep an eye out for.

1204,"This was a great place for a weekend of food and football. It was easy to get to and from and if the weather had been better the opportunity for riverside walks was really tempting . Local pub recommendations too. Staff were very helpful both at check in carrying bags upstairs but also at meal times accommodating us around tables already booked felt like home from home. Brunch not breakfast was spot on - no rush to get downstairs on Saturday and Sunday morning, instead a gentle tea and coffee in bed, lovely shower and then a casual glide down to a mixed breakfast lunch menu. Lots of locals having bubbly and brunch! The room appliances and provisions were excellent and our room had a proper desk and light set up for those who need to work whilst away, also a comfy armchair big tv too. Friday night had happy hour .it was an easy walk to Craven Cottage for Saturday football And they had big screen football then live music in the evening. Locally supported establishment with a great feel.","January 20, 2017","22    The Captain Cook

The food in the pub is delicious, especially their Sunday Roast, and it's a perfect place to enjoy a drink after a long day sightseeing. We spent nine wonderful nights in this lovely accommodation and had easy access to center London through multiple bus and tube stops. We would definitely stay here again and have already recommended it to many of our friends. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a stay in one of London's hidden gems.

1206,"I liked the Captain Cook the moment I saw its pictures. The maps on the wall, the wooden furniture, the colour of the light... It was just dreamy. I didn't even care to read many reviews before I booked it. Fortunately, it lived up to our expectation. True, the stay was not 100% perfect. 1. Our room faced the road, so when vehicles ran by it could be noisy. 2. Occasionally there were feathers pointing out from the blanket which felt scratchy. 3. There was a layer of limescale in the kettle. Despite of these, I absolutely enjoyed my stay there. The room was spacious and beautiful just like its pictures suggest, and the bed was very very big and comfy. There were lots of hangers next to a big window. The wifi signal was strong and stable. It's easily reached by buses going out from tube stations. It's situated in a nice and safe neighbourhood. And very importantly, its staff have excellent customer service. Overall speaking, good value of money, especially when it's more on the less expensive side among all choices in London. Definitely going back if I ever have the chance to visit London again, and would recommend my friends to stay there.","November 1, 2016","22    The Captain Cook

1217,"We arrived at The Captain Cook well after midnight, but the wonderfully helpful hotel manager had given us exactly the instructions we needed to find our room and our bed. And were we pleased! For budget reasons, we had chosen a very small room with an external (but private) bathroom. The room was elegantly decorated (as befitting a ship's captain!) and the bed was enormous. Linens were crisp and white. Teas, coffee and a big glass bottle of water sat invitingly on a writing desk Captain Cook would have loved. And the bathroom, though down the hall, was spotless and very contemporary in design. (The little containers of shampoo and body wash were so charmingly designed I had to take some home.) For $175 Canadian a night, this tasteful, cosy room was excellent value in a city like London. My daughter and I were completely comfortable there, and I'd happily stay again if their prices don't shoot up. It is a bit out of the way, in an interesting but safe district called Fulham, but everything in London is connected by a brilliant transit system, so that wasn't an issue for us.

The loos are clean, too.But the best bit (apart from the attitude of the welcoming staff), is the food - seriously top quality, generous, and well put together.

The ""restaurant"" is small and very simple - almost hostel like in its design and decor. The only reason the hotel did not get a 5 for me was the fact that the drinks served as part of the £5.99 continental breakfast are instant. The food is cheap and unexciting but serves a fuelling purpose.The location is ideal for exploring Wimbledon, Richmond and the surrounding areas and is only 15 minutes walk from a tube station.

I am sure the hotel manager will jump on this and reply that the room is bigger but it isn’t. I was in a cosy double last week and it was exactly that - cosy. But I expected it and paid for that so it was fine. This week I wanted more space as I’ll be in the room for longer doing some work - but it’s essentially the same room as the ‘cosy’ just with the bathroom door in a different place. Technically it might be bigger but only because there is a tiny bit of hallway (absolutely no extra not useful space).Very disappointed with the service when I called to query the room. No resolution offered.The first time I stayed I had an amazing ‘deluxe room’ with lots of space - so I know they exist!Also, the breakfast is crap (the cheapest supermarket style bread which can be toasted and pastries out of a packet), don’t bother unless it’s included in your room rate. Lastly there was noise all night from the hospital and the stupid doorbell that goes off every time someone uses the lift.Save your money and go somewhere else.Gave 2 stars as it was very clean.","April 30, 2019","23    Pelican London Hotel and Residence

Turns out he got moved hospitals and I needed to change locations! Not ideal I know, especially with the hotel being non-refundable but I know you can request to cancel and receive a refund. Id emailed twice and still 3 days later had heard nothing, so I phoned the hotel to which they say they definitely do offer a refund, its booking.com who don't.. So, I call booking.com, they made numerous phone calls and emails to the property with no reply so I requested a call back. Received my call informing me that the hotel have given me false information about cancellation/refunds, they even tried to get at least half back for me considering the circumstances but still they wouldn't agree.

1254,"For its location (12 mins walk from tube and at least 4 bus routes start from right outside the front door) it is clean and good value. Early (2pm) check in is useful too. Rooms are as pictured in terms of quality and good in terms of size given the price. I've stayed in much smaller and much more expensive double rooms in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Very helpful staff on 24 hour front desk. We needed to extend our stay and they were able to let us move our bags straight from one room to the other rather than checking out at 11am, leaving bags with reception, then checking in at 2pm. Tooting Broadway has a good choice of good eateries (cafes, restaurants, pubs) and shops too including Sainsburys, Aldi and Lidl Supermarkets very near the tube station. Tubes very frequent and it's easy to change at Stockwell to the opposite platform to get Victoria line to/from West End or stay on Northern Line via Bank for the East/City or via Charing Cross for Central London. Note: Pelican Hotel is next to St Georges Hospital with a busy Emergency Department so I was concerned we may get disturbed through the night by ambulances/sirens coming and going but we didn't hear a single one whilst at the hotel (for 5 nights Tue-Sat).

1257,"I tend to agree with one of the earlier reviews saying that the photos are deceptive. The rooms was much smaller in real life, there website did have the room dimensions on it, but if your like most people it will mean nothing to you, because we don't tend to know or use sq ft when we are talking about room sizes. The staff were very helpful and friendly, I was a bit concerned to see that they didn't have mattress protectors on the beds and only one thin sheet between me and the stained mattress. You had to pay £5.99 for breakfast, but I didn't feel that it was really worth it. It was a very, very basic continental breakfast. A few cereal chooses, few tea bags and coffee, a couple of croissants and cinnamon swirls with bread and a couple of apples and bananas and that's it! I would of gone to a local café if I knew the breakfast was that limited.

Very large windows, with both muslin and curtains. Aircon/heater worked greated. Wi-fi was absolutely fine. Check-in quick and easy and friendly. Check out time is 11am. I really can't think of anything negative to say about this hotel... We didn't try the breakfast so can't comment on that but the hospital next door has a cafe and canteen (and small Marks & Spencers too) and The immediate vicinity of the hotel is quiet, right by a hospital, so no issues with traffic noise. It's a one minute walk from the bus stop, or about 12 mins walk from Tooting Broadway tube station and a large Sainsburys supermarket, and five mins walk from the main street where there is a great selection of cafes, restaurants etc. In fact, Tooting is a great neighbourhood. I was travelling with my elderly mother, who especially appreciated the spacious shower and room. Finally, our room was under £50 which is exceptional value for money. We will definitely be returning.","March 6, 2018","23    Pelican London Hotel and Residence

1282,"I booked a single room for two nights while my son was staying in St George's Hospital. The hotel is almost in the hospital grounds and it only took 5 minutes from the hotel to my son's ward. The hotel from the outside looks like a 13 storey block of flats, but inside it is light and modern and clean. My single room was well equipped and clean ... all except a horrible mustard cushion which had a couple of nasty stains on it, but I chucked that on the floor anyway. I maybe should have taken it down to reception. The bed was bigger than the average single, about 4' wide, so plenty of room to stretch out. There was a wall mounted telly at the end of the bed and the usual kettle with complimentary tea/coffee/biscuits. The bathroom was spotless with a nice powerful shower, fluffy towels and complimentary bath gel, shampoo and confitioner. I didn't see a hair dryer but later found this in the drawer beside the bed.The price of my room included breakfast, although they also provide this as an addition at £5.99 pp for those rooms where it is not included.. This is a continental style breakfast and although not a huge choice included cornflakes, museli, fruit, yogurts, white/brown bread (with a toaster), jams, pre-packed cheese and a selection of croissants and pastries. There was also tea, coffee and a couple of different fruit juices. The hotel certainly served my purpose very well and the cost was very reasonable. The only downside to the hotel is the fact that it is about 15 minutes walk to Tooting High Street, there is nowhere to get any food nearby in the evening after leaving the hospital, and there is no car parking.","February 7, 2018","23    Pelican London Hotel and Residence

The locaction is so, so as is not very close to the city center, Tooting, the price was good, the bad was the breakfast, too basic.Reception: Was fine, kinda cold but okRoom: The best of this hotel, it was modern, although you have the view to the street you also have the view to the cementery, but anyways is ok (if you dont care)Location: Is so so, if you come by bus is perfect cause the bus station is very near, but if you come by subway the city center is not that close you have to walk several blocks.Breakfast: I was in several countries and this was the more basic breakfast I had, I was the only on the breakfast room by the way. Just to tell you that there's not coffe machine but just instat coffe packets, the same you get for free in the room.... Will I come back? Possible if I have to be around the South West SW London,but it would be a lot better to have meat and a coffee machine on the breakfast.","February 5, 2018","23    Pelican London Hotel and Residence

1284,"I stayed in this hotel for one night only with my mother in a twin room. The hotel was relatively easy to find and is about 1min walk from the bus stop and about 10-15 min walk from Tooting High Street. I was very happy with this hotel. I was approached very efficiently and I didn't have to wait long before I could go to my room. Upon entering my room I was very pleasantly surprised how nice it looked. The room had tea and coffee facilities, iron and ironing board, desk and TV. The room was very spacious and despite being on the first floor was also very quiet. Free toiletries were also available. The bed was very comfortable and warm and the room also consists of heating which you can self control. Because I don't like the cold I was very happy about the self control heating. I found it a little confusing to use, but after pressing a few buttons got the room to my perfect temperature. The price was reasonably and without a doubt if I'm ever in south London again, I would definitely stay here and recommended others to do so too.

1285,Stayed here for 5 nights whilst on a course. It's very clean and the shower very powerful. Good tv at the end of the bed. Cleaned every day and nice they leave shampoo if you need it and biscuits every day! The room was a bit cold think it was draft from the windows. Stayed on the first floor which did smell of smoke constantly in the corridor despite it being a non smoking hotel. The bed was really comfortable and couldn't hear much noise from other residents; however every time someone came back through the lift the noise when the doors opened is quite noisy. This didn't seem to be a problem if you're a bit further away from the lift having spoken to other people. The breakfast is very basic but sufficient. For the price of the hotel it was much better than I expected and was perfectly fine for my location for the week. I would definitely stay again if I was in Tooting. ,"January 21, 2018","23    Pelican London Hotel and Residence

Also, it was extremely helpful that the hotel had a luggage room for us to keep our bags in as we obviously didn't want to lug them around all day while we out and about around London.The only downside is that at first we were given a room with two single beds so we had to push them together ourselves.

There is no restaurant or bar at the property, although a continental breakfast is offered in a small dining room.We booked an 'extra-accessible' room which has an adapted wet-room style bathroom. This accessible room (No.1 on the ground floor) was originally designed for a single bed but has a double bed in it, which meant that it was impossible to manoeuvre a wheelchair inside the room or open the bathroom door wide enough to enter the bathroom in the wheelchair.It is well served by buses and tubes, although disabled guests arriving by train might find Wimbledon station more convenient as it is staffed all the time and has lifts (whereas Tooting and Haydons Road have no step free access)","September 21, 2017","23    Pelican London Hotel and Residence

1300,"We stayed for one night on our way through London based on the reviews, the price and the fact that they had air conditioning. The reception welcome was fantastic. The room had a nice decor and the mattress was comfortable, but my 12-year-old daughter who has watched one too many videos on Youtube regarding the cleanliness of airplanes, hotel rooms, etc. noticed that the sheets weren't clean. I was skeptical at first when she told me but we turned on all of the lights and upon inspection she was right! There were several hairs and some stains on the white sheets and also on the bed cover which would have come out with a wash, especially with the use of bleach. The sheets did look freshly pressed but I'm not sure how to explain what we saw. The base boards and floor of the bathroom where nowhere near clean either. And there were various stains on the walls and baseboards of the room. Not the worst room I've seen in terms of cleanliness but clean is clean, right? As we arrived late and it was now past midnight we just dealt with the sheets but my daughter is turning me into a germophobe! We also noticed that the mattress had only one sheet over it with no other barrier between it and the sheet. That's just gross. I think this hotel has potential. The AC worked well on an extremely hot for London day. The doors are thick which contributed to a very quiet stay. The room and bathroom are decorated/outfitted fairly nicely(although there's almost no counter space in the bathroom). But the housekeeping need to step it up big time to earn my recommendation.","June 21, 2017","23    Pelican London Hotel and Residence

Only 5 minutes to walk to a pleasant pub and Tooting Broadway, which has dozens of restaurants and takeaways. It's a fair location and in real terms, ""a bed for the night"". The hotel is very clean - you get fresh towels daily too. Staff are attentive, efficient and reassuringly always around. There's basic stuff available in the fridge from reception, soft drinks and water. The rooms have decent TV's and are all efficiently air conditioned - Cool or warm, you can easily set for your own comfort. Lift access to all floors, again, very clean - they also have excellent security and cctv covering every floor. Walking distance to the hospital takes just 1 minute - The hospital has a Marcs & Spencer, a coffee shop (great baguettes) and the standard but efficient cafe (breakfast here works).

The Receptionist wasn't particularly helpful in suggestions about what was nearby. I suppose none of that is the fault of the hotel, but they could gather together a bit of information about amenities & services in the local area, given that the hotel has nothing except rooms. The room was OK - a tiny bathroom, with a shower only, and a double room that was OK for 1 person, but 2 people would have been very squeezed.

Friendly staff and real continental breakfast.The management have shared a little luxury with some nice touches: complimentary soft drinks, a variety of teas, coffee and hot chocolate, chocolates, facial tissues, hair conditioner and other bathroom accessories. A decent size bath towel would have been icing on the cake! Rooms quiet from traffic noise but be mindful that sound proofing between rooms isn't great and noisy residents may easily be heard. Parking spaces are just outside on private ground and would be suitable for motorbikes. For public transport, the London Underground is a few minutes walk away at Hendon Central... about 25 minutes takes you to King's Cross Station and further into the heart of the City.

The only reason for not giving 5 stars is the difficult location if driving - luckily I had a satnav as it’s not easy to find if coming on the back roads, and is right on the very busy north circular, with cars flying by. So it can be hard to get in and out of the small car park.

1326,"Stayed here when we travelled to Winter Wonderland in December. We arrived early but checked in and were able to leave our bags. It's a lovely place with very clean and comfortable rooms. Nice ideas on space saving and making the most of every available space as we were in the top of the building under the eves as it were. Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom spacious with a lovely shower. Plenty of elbow room and suited our needs exactly. If I was being very picky, it was a shame the TV was not a little larger or on a swivel bracket - its was off set to one side so not that comfortable to watch when laid up in bed. One or two items in short supply for tea & coffee tray (why is it hotels only ever put 4 milk jiggers out!) and only one breakfast tea, tea bag - not a complaint, don't get me wrong, but with everything else so right about this place, just these little things detract. The place is quiet on an evening as pretty much it's a very nice B&B. The staff were very courteous and polite which was nice and very apologetic (although they didn't need to be) when they struggled a little with our drinks when we got back. Nice to sit comfortably and quietly watching a bit of news before retiring. Breakfast is continental and very nice it was too. Would we come back? Definitely as very convenient for us travelling from Yorkshire and even easier walking 2 minutes to the tube with only 30 minutes putting you in the West End.

They have done an excellent job with the hotel decor, but there were some things that prohibit me from recommending it.Pros:Decor is lovelyBreakfast was sufficient to get the basicsBathroom amenities were high quality Location is very close to Hendon tube station Cons:The bed was awful. Thin, hard mattress and pillows that were flat and lumpy. I did not sleep well at all. Sheets were low thread count and scratchy. Why they spent so much time to have such a beautiful hotel and failed at one of the most important things perplexes me. The desk is not staffed 24 hours so if you need something you are basically out of luck.My hairdryer was broken in my roomThe wifi was so slow I could not get on or do any work. I had to leave the hotel and find a place with internet.The shower head in my room was installed so it tilted toward the wall and was fixed so you can’t adjust it. To get water in my hair I had to press myself against the wall to catch the full stream- I’m 5’2” and 100 lbs so I pity anyone larger than me trying to use that shower.Bottom line, if you want to stay in the area and don’t care about a comfortable bed,wifi or a courteous staff then you will enjoy this hotel.

The breakfast is ample although a bit ordinary, e.g. all the cereals are packet cereal. The croissants were not all that fresh but there was a good variety of breads and pastries. Although I don't have a full breakfast, it was available. Parking is available on site. The room and bed were comfortable. The room is not overly big but large enough for the two of us and our bags. The hotel is modern but in a conservative style. The rooms facing the back are subjected to a constant hum of the air-conditioning units. The bathroom is fine with a large shower but the basin could do with an extra shelf on the wall or on the mirror for one's accessories. The shower really needs some non-slip strips when you get in. I asked for and was supplied with a rubber mat after slipping a couple of times.","November 1, 2017","24    The Hide London

1362,"I recently visited The Hide London and really enjoyed my stay. The hotel is a small boutique hotel run by very helpful and friendly staff. It is located close to supermarkets, restaurants, a mall and most importantly it is a stone's throw away from the underground station. Heading into Central London was so easy from this hotel. If you are planning to see the sites and explore Central London purchase an Oyster card for zones 1-3. The station for the hotel is on the border of zone 3/4. There is no need to purchase zone 4 if you are only planning to explore the sites and mostly Central London. That will save you a little money on the card. Overall I enjoyed my stay. My only con would be the water in the shower doesn't get too hot, but that is a personal preference. Absolutely nothing against the hotel or my stay. ","July 14, 2017","24    The Hide London

The Hide is a business and the T's & C's are pretty clear. Why would you expect a refund! I'm pretty sure The Hide didn't ask Adele to cancel her performance!3, this hotel is clean, tidy, well managed, customer focussed and reasonably priced4, personally, I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when I visit London5, for a more balanced view, have a look at all the other reviewsI cannot recommend The Hide highly enough!","July 6, 2017","24    The Hide London

It's location at the end of the M1 and right next to Hendon Central Underground station was the main reason for choosing it but the good TA reviews persuaded us too.

Our room was comfortable and well equipped, even with a free minibar, and faced the rear of the property so it was quiet. Everything feels quite new and modern. Parking was not a problem as there seems to be plenty of space. Next morning we enjoyed a continental breakfast which I have to say is one of the best of its kind I have had anywhere in the world, and I stay in hotels for over 100 nights a year.

1371,"The entire area is full of accommodations for travellers. It appears that some of the hotels share services or such due to the way they are set up. That said, I felt it wasn't as central as I would have liked but given the price of something ""more central"", this was quite alright. It is connected to the Phoenix hotel next door in terms of some services but is not physically connected it seems. This front desk is not open 24 hours and in off hours, the service transfers to the Phoenix Hotel. The room was very clean but there was a very slight smell in the bathroom--probably from the shower curtain that needed to be changed/washed. Otherwise, the rest of the suite was well maintained. I would say that compared to other places I've stayed at, this is only average and is not exceptional. There is wifi, the amenities are available for basic stay, the room is clean and tidy and the area is safe. There is not a breakfast included in this one--which is fine (I'd rather no breakfast than something slapped together). The staff are friendly enough but I still found a bit distant. The areas is lovely so going for a stroll is nice. There is a chance to leave luggage after you check out if your flight is later in the day. If you are looking for boutique-y or more personal, this isn't going to fit... it is a good place to stay and sleep.Would stay again if visiting London.","July 11, 2019","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

A lot of beggars, homeless and unsavoury type characters now are aplenty down nearby Bayswater. The street is dirty and not pleasant to wander. Some of the restaurants also add (non-advertised or advised) service charges to bills without advising, to me indicating that the area has become a real tourist trap. The hotel was okay, but as previously reviewed, there is no lift and the stairs are quite narrow, the rooms and bathrooms are very small and would only suit a couple for 1-2 nights maximum.

1380,"We stayed at Kensington Gardens Hotel for five nights in June 2018. Check-in was easy enough next door at the adjoining hotel. They gave you an actual key (not a key-card) with a room number attached to it. This made it hard to fit in a pocket, but we made it work. Our hotel room was on the top floor, and just like the other reviews, if you have a lot of luggage, it is a lot of work. This was the last leg of a four-leg trip through Europe (where we got engaged!) so we had a lot of heavy luggage that haul up. There is no elevators or assistance for bags, so be prepared. Like a lot of loft-like hotels, there is not HVAC/Air conditioning, instead, there is a fan and a window - just how like it was when I was raised in London! The staff encountered were friendly and were quiet, and the room was immaculately clean. Looked newly renovated and the bed was nice, a little firm, but nice.

1381,"Being honest I was a bit iffy when booking this hotel. Given that it’s official rating seems to be 2-star, and it’s very competitively priced, I was worried this might be reflected in standards of cleanliness, service etc., but booked it anyway on the basis of the previous reviews. The reviews were accurate and the rating does it no justice whatsoever! The hotel, room and bathroom were all spotless. It was a lovely location, overlooking a very quiet garden square, and very centrally located in terms of tube access. Bayswater (District & Circle) is a 3 or 4 minute stroll, while Queenswater (Central Line) is just a couple of minutes further, and Paddington is maximum a 15 minute walk.We got a lovely welcome from Rosanne (sorry if this is not correct spelling) who could not have been more welcoming or helpful. Reception is staffed until 5pm daily. After 5pm you book in or collect your keys at the next door sister hotel, the Phoenix Hotel. Really amazing value for London.

1386,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in July. The price according to the quality isn't justified at all. The only good thing is the location as it's next to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations, both useful.As we arrived, we had a £125 charge in our credit card made by them in order to check the availability of the card without permission or any kind of notification for us to know they were gonna do that.We asked the hotel staff if they charged that amount and at first they told us they didn't, we had to ask twice to two different people to find out it was theirs. For that reason, we had to cancel our credit card immediately as we didn't initially know where that charge came from. That was a very annoying mishap as we were abroad.On the second hand, the room was not as clean as expected, and we were not able to use the kettle they offer on their webpage as it was extremely dirty. Same thing with the air conditioning, both things were a bit nasty.Finally, we were accused to have smoked on the room without any clear evidence of it, which was quite offensive and untrue. I don't want to go on holiday and feel uncomfortable and disgusted and pay £500 for it.","July 16, 2018","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

My husband upgraded our room to a suite as I was celebrating a birthday. The room was certainly huge and the view outstanding. I would say that the room needed smartening up a little and one particular point to make is bathroom felt below par with large crack running along wall and some mound in one corner, however on the whole the room was very clean. Housekeeping were quick to respond to requests of additional towels and when we requested a container to transport flowers home that my husband had arranged for the room, they responded immediately. Breakfast is self service and was both plentiful and tasty, with a large selection to choose from. Staff are friendly and helpful.

1388,"I stayed here for two nights with my sister while in London. It was just ok. It was clean and served it's purpose of being a place to stay. However, the room was incredibly cramped. I am an average sized person and I really struggled to survive with my sister and our suitcases in the space provided. The shower was outside the bathroom and in the bedroom, which was not only bizarre but provided zero privacy. If you're there with a spouse, no problem. But with a sibling or friend, it provides a very awkward situation! There is not 24/7 reception services. When we arrived, we had to check in down the street at the Phoenix Hotel. That wouldn't be too big of an issue except we had to lug our bags with us. You also couldn't enter the building without first dialing reception to let you in...I believe in security, but this added only frustration and was a waste of time every time we wanted to enter the hotel. This hotel needs to get with the modern world and create keys that allow entry on their own. This hotel is also not air conditioned (as many hotels in London aren't). They provided a fan and a window, but opening the window allowed flies in. The window also opened onto an area directly across from another room. So if we wanted fresh air, we had to accept that we wouldn't have any privacy.","June 25, 2018","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

Reached at 12:30AM on the day of my check-in, having informed the property, they mentioned I would need to pick up the key from their ""sister"" property, which is next door, Phoenix hotel. Was given keys (we'd booked two rooms for two nights) to rooms on the 4th & 5th floor of a non-lift(elevator) building. No recourse available- the receptionist at Phoenix could neither offer a room at a lower floor, or; a room at their hotel(which incidentally features an elevator). I literally lifted my heavy bags on my head & hefted them 5 flights of stairs to reach a room, which can charitably be called a ""coop"", tiny - about 8 ft by 5ft with a bathroom 1/2 this size. Now, None of the reviews on hotels.com had even hinted at this feature of either the room, or; the hotel..which points to a degree of collusion between this stellar agent (hotels.com) & the hotel, in question.

Hyde Park a short walk away along with Notting Hill and Portabello Market.We arrived at 7.30 pm so collected key from neighbouring Phoenix Hotel. No lift, we were on 3rd floor, not an issue for us but could be for others.Room and en-suite looked newly renovated, nicely presented, clean and tidy. The room was small but large cupboard for storage. Bed was comfortable.Facilities included toiletries, nice fluffy towels, TV, plenty coffee/tea etc.For the price, we thought it was excellent value and would stay again if similar price.","March 12, 2018","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

1391,"We spent 1 night at Kensington Gardens Hotel whilst attending Hyde Parks Winter Wonderland. The Hotel is really smart and tidy. The staff could not be anymore helpful, professional or polite. They made us feel really welcome. We had our 10 months old baby with us too. It was a really pleasant 1 1/4 mile walk through Kensington Park into Hyde park. Plenty of Eateries just around the corner from the hotel. The breakfast was served at the sister hotel next door - Phoenix Hotel. Again staff made us very welcome. English breakfast was nice and cooked to order. We would def recommend and also stay here again. Thank you.. Simon, Hayley and little Tilly ","December 2, 2017","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

1392,"We stayed in a triple room at the Kensington Gardens Hotel and loved it! We walked to the hotel from Paddington Station (about a 15 minute walk). We arrived late morning and were warmly greeted by the host (forgot her name, but she was lovely and very helpful). We were a bit too early for checkin, but she grabbed our bags and locked them in her office so we could start exploring London. When we arrived later in the day, we noticed that she had delivered our bags to our room. The room itself was in the lower level. VERY quiet. Not a huge room, but most certainly large enough for the three of us. There was a large window that looked up to the street level. There were plenty of lights, including nice reading lights by the two beds. The bathroom was compact, but very clean and modern. The location was awesome. Within walking distance of the Bayswater tube station, and there are loads of cafes, restaurants, pubs and shops nearby. We enjoyed a couple nearby pubs, some awesome Indian food, and some of the great nearby shops. A short walk away was Kensington Park, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park and more. With three of us, it was actually cheaper for us to use Uber instead of the tube, and it was really easy to get cars in this area. The office at the hotel is open 8a-5p (8a-3p on Sundays). Like most small hotels, they ask you to leave your keys when you are gone. When the office is closed, they run all the keys to their sister property, the Phoenix Hotel, which is a couple doors down. The staff there was great as well - very friendly. This is where there is a bar, and they also serve breakfast here.Overall it was a very enjoyable stay, and we would not hesitate one bit to stay here again.","November 27, 2017","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

1393,"My mother and I stayed for one night in a twin bedroom. This hotel is beautiful! It's walking distance from Bayswater underground station and an entire street of resteraunts and shops, and even Hyde Park. The bathroom and room itself were very clean and spacious. We had a lovely view of the square infornt of the hotel from the second floor. We did arrive later so we needed to pick the key up form the sister hotEl but this wasn't a problem at all and the staff were very pleasant. An electronic fan was provided in the wardrobe however we didn't need it as we found it a little cold but once we got into bed we were fine. As the windows are old they did not keep out the noise, we heard nearly everything in the street but again this wasn't a problem because the hotel is along a side street which was quiet enough.I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short or long stay and I will most definitely be staying again.","November 13, 2017","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

1394,"This hotel is a great location - walking distance to Kensington Palace and the shops and areas around, as well as two tube stations. It felt like you were in a more residential area, which was nice. Our guess is that it was once apartments, now converted to a hotel. It is affiliated with the Phoenix hotel next door - which means reception is only there 8:00am - 5:00pm Monday to Friday. So you need to stop at the Phoenix Hotel to either drop off or pick up your room key if you are outside those timeframes. This wasn't a bother, we just didn't expect it. Room was standard sizing for Europe and clean. Staff were quite nice! No complaints at all.","October 21, 2017","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

The hotel is in a great location and close to both Bayswater and Queensway tube stations which is good for getting around. The area itself is quiet enough and feels very safe even at night. I had room 16, if I remember correctly, which is right beside reception so I didn't have any stairs to climb.The rooms are quite small but very clean and comfortable and have a kettle, TV and a cosy bed. The wifi was fast enough for me to watch videos on and not have to use my data. The only thing I didn't like was the view from my room which looked out onto another wall of the hotel but this didn't bother me too much as I was there to see the sights, not look out my hotel window.

However was told at check in we'd been moved next door to their sister hotel which on impressions of the reception thought ok fine. We couldn't see the room as was too early but they assured us our bags etc would be moved there and all would be well. We were in London to see take that at the 02 .. we got back to the ""sister"" hotel at 1 in the morning to be shown to a very outdated shabby room with our cases missing ! Guy on reception was very nice and showed us more rooms but to be fair they were all shabby and not like the images we had based our booking on. We were very disappointed this was a treat for my friends 50th birthday and I felt very let down and annoyed this wasn't what I had booked. The positives though were the staff were very professional and nice but the overall stay was spoilt . I would be very careful if you book this place that they take your booking and mislead you by moving you next door. ","June 12, 2017","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

1405,"When in London, we use to go to nearby Phoenix hotel; this time it was full, so we choose its ""sister"" hotel. And must say that the choice was very good. The hotel looks recently renovated, and the room we had, on the top of the building, was probably the most spacious I ever had in central London, same with the bathroom; very nice decor, beautiful view on the square, in the room there is also a fireplace, to make a better ambience. Very comfy beds. There is no elevator in the hotel, so you gotta climb a bit, but was not a problem at all. The only improvement I could see was the water flow of the shower, and wifi was not regular all the time.The ladies at reception extremely nice and helpful, very good staff at both Kensington Gardens and Phoenix (in the evening the Phoenix reception works for K.G. guests, too).

Also the kettle and hair dryer work fine and they supply some biscuits, tea and cocoa powder so you can have a snack if you in a hurry. Only downsides are there is no lift and no 24h concierge, so you have to leave your keys in the lobby of the next door hotel (Phoenix).

1422,"My friend and I stayed at Kensington Gardens Hotel for 5 nights in the middle of July, and we loved it. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. As it is the sister hotel to Phoenix Hotel (literally right next next door) you do have to go to Phoenix for breakfast (which was like any other hotel breakfast, you could get continental or hot cooked food) but there is so many restaurants and pubs that do English breakfasts that you can choose from on the main street just down the road from the hotel. You also have to leave your keys with the reception staff when you leave and if you get back to the hotel after 5pm be aware that you do have to collect the keys from Phoenix hotel! Also there is no elevator and some may find the stairs to be steep, so if you have many or heavy bags you might want to ask for a lower floor. The rooms were clean (looked recently refurbished) and looked just like the pictures provided by the hotel. We stayed in a room with two single beds with two large suitcases and found that was more than enough room considering we were really only in the room to sleep anyway! There was no aircon or ceiling fan, but we found that if we had the small fan (found in the closet) and opened a window the temperature was perfectly fine (although we are from Australia so we are used to extremely hot weather!). There's free wifi too which was more than adequate for us to use simply for basic internet browsing and uploading some pictures to facebook.Great location too, a short walk from Bayswater station made it easy to navigate around London; short walk to many restaurants and pubs; and obviously a short walk from Kensington Gardens which was amazing. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!","September 30, 2016","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

1423,"I really wanted to like this hotel... From the 3 flights of stairs (no elevators, and keep in mind in much of Europe it's ground floor then first floor); no AC (ok, I get it, it's UK); to the parties neighborhood kids have until 3am; it's hard not to complain. When I arrived via Bayswater station (quick and easy to get to the hotel), there was no reception. Another traveler had to tell me to go next door to the Phoenix Hotel to check in. That was odd, but I'm flexible and have seen this before. I got my keys and went back next door. ""Ok, three flights. How bad can it be?"" I'm in decent shape, but after a day of flying, I was huffing and puffing when approaching my room with my heavy carry-on and backpack (I'm on business). It was hot inside (rare to get high 80F sort of weather in London). Good thing I found a fan in the closet. The windows were ajar and fixed to open a certain size for safety. I had really a great view of the garden and the neighborhood building. Quaint and cute. I loved the neighborhood and I feel it really expresses what London is about what the cultural mix. I've been trying to stay fit while in travels so I found an awesome organic supermarket down the street. I needed some meat, so I dropped by a Lebanese restaurant for some chicken taouk (try it). That was my sans carbs dinner. It was perfect to walk more through the area and explore the local scene. By 9pm I was ready to crash and get a good night's rest flying in from SFO via Copenhagen. It was a long day and I needed to get a lot done the next day around town. It's ironic that right when I turned out the lights, kids and their bumpin' cars kept coming and going. Lots of laughter and showing off their stereo system.... Until 3am. I couldn't exactly close my windows bc it's be too stuffy (remember, no AC) and what could the hotel staff do for street clamor? (Sad face)I did not get much rest. The saving grace was that I was able to find some awesome empanadas and a great latte down the street for breakfast. In the future, I wouldn't mind staying in the area again, but not this hotel. Sorry... A good night's sleep Trumps charm. ","September 13, 2016","25    Kensington Gardens Hotel

We decided to eat in the restaurant and weren't disappointed. As we were the only ones in there we received great service. The menu offers five or six starters, mains and desserts and our Calamari, Nachos, Fish and Chips and Chicken Burger were all freshly cooked and were clearly not freezer food. The cocktails we had were very strong and reasonably priced. The only minor issue we had was with the breakfast. I booked for pre paid bed and breakfast on the Lansbury website only to be told by Zuber that our booking was shown on his system as room only. After showing him my booking he kindly waived the breakfast charge and assured me it was an IT glitch with their system. Saying that the buffet breakfast was very nice with all the usual items and staff were again very helpful and polite. Don't be put off by the location as you are only five minutes walk to All Saints or Poplar DLR. I will definitely be back. ","July 13, 2019","26    Lansbury Heritage Hotel

1428,"The hotel itself was reasonably OK. The room and bed were quite nice. The bathroom was small but the shower worked well. TV was fine.Tea and coffee in the room. However, the window did not open at all so the room got stuffy and airless.The air con was noisy and we couldn't get it to work properly. There was a gym and sauna downstairs. This was supposedly open till 10pm but when I went at 9pm, they had turned it off. There was no apology but they turned it on although it didn't get hot before 10pm. The main start switch on the treadmill in the gym didn't work but someone came and showed me how to get it to work.The breakfast and lunch were fine. Nothing special but quite OK. The restaurant was a bit dark an airless in the basement. The staff were lovely throughout: very friendly and helpful. However, there didn't seem to be any overall manager overseeing things.The hotel was excellent value for London - around £110 including breakfast for 2.The main drawback was the location. It was quite a nice hotel right on the edge of a Tower Hamlets housing estate. There were no restaurants (except fried chicken) and although the DLR was very close, the tube was a 15-20 minute walk navigating a huge road. Uber was at hand and we did get about that way.","June 23, 2019","26    Lansbury Heritage Hotel

1432,"I booked to stay hear last minute as we had tickets for a concert at the o2. I must say I was very pleasantly surprised, I normally stay at the rosewood when in London but wanted somewhere a bit closer this time as we didn’t have lots of time for commuting.Direct access routes via the DLR to get to the hotel. The DLR only takes about 10 mins also to get to and from London city airport. Great location for events at the o2 approximately 20 mins via DLR and underground. More importantly about £16 back in a taxi from the o2 to avoid the massive underground queues.The hotel it’s self was immaculate, very clean everywhere. Front of house staff are also very welcoming and helpful.The room itself was very nicely decorated and well equipped, I have spent a lot more money in other hotel and got a fraction of the luxuries and service that we got here.I don’t really have any negative things to say but maybe just a bit of constructive feedback that may be helpful was that my room on the ground floor wasn’t the quietest of rooms. I couldn’t figure out if it was the plumbing above that was very noisy when the toilet or taps were being used. Finally the info booklet informs guests that room service is available to 11pm for some items. I called for room service at 10:40 and was told the kitchen was closed. However I do feel the last point is understandable if it’s been a quiet night for the chef to let them get away.All in all I was very pleased and felt that the hotel was great value and served its purpose well. I wouldn’t hesitate about staying again if I was attending another concert at the o2.","June 5, 2019","26    Lansbury Heritage Hotel

The restaurant is the best in the Docklands area that we saw. And the breakfast was probably the best we've ever had traveling in London (over 40 times). We also wanted to see a new part of London we had not seen, and got to know the Docklands Light Railway which became an easy way to get into Victoria and Knightsbridge. Personnel and staff were outstanding and dedicated individuals. We enjoyed the spa with excellent massages to start off our trip.

We had a problem with the AC (it didn’t want to drop below the boiling point of titanium) which was fixed instantly when we reported it. The photos and bas relief carvings and chandeliers all add a touch of opulence for what is essentially a bargain priceThe only suggestion I’d make to the management would be to buy some teapots for breakfast - we had to make tea in the (small) cups which is quite labour intensive and wastes tea bags. It’s a bit off the beaten path and the walk from Canary Wharf isn’t pleasant but it’s well worth the inconvenience. ,"January 18, 2019","26    Lansbury Heritage Hotel

Spa was small but nice. I would 100% stay again.","December 13, 2018","26    Lansbury Heritage Hotel

1467,"We stayed here for 2 nights in one of the tower rooms whilst visiting London for the weekend. From Canary Wharf station it is a short walk to the DLR, and then 2 stops (to cross over the busy road) before a 5min walk to the hotel. We received a warm welcome and staff were very professional and courteous throughout our stay. The hotel is smartly decorated, and the room was very well presented. The room contained a TV with the usual channels, and also a free to use mobile that could be taken out whilst staying at the hotel if needed. The room was very quiet at night. Breakfast was very good, with a hot and cold buffet, including English breakfast. I would recommend this place for a weekend visit.","December 11, 2018","26    Lansbury Heritage Hotel

1473,I could not fault the room or any of the facilities at this hotel. They were as fantastic as all previous reviews led me to believe. The location is wonderful. Very well connected but a very quiet street. The building is a lovely sensitive conversion of a listed property. The bed was comfy and the room was spacious. The breakfast was very good and plentiful. The only thing I would say is that don’t expect the staff to do anything beyond their minimum obligation. We had booked the hotel for our wedding night as we were getting married in Greenwich and wanted something a little bit special. We always try to support smaller hotels particularly as this one seemed to be of a very high standard. When booking I asked if we could possibly check in any earlier as check in was at 3 and I was getting married at 4 so would need to do so before then. I was sent email by staff telling me they would be able to let me know nearer the time. Perfectly reasonable. I rang the week before to be told it wasn’t possible and I would have to arrive at 3. Too late by this point to book elsewhere. We’ll run with it. I rang on the day and was told my room wouldn’t be ready till 3 but they would happily store bags if I arrived earlier. Would they put them in the room as I wouldn’t be back till gone midnight because of the wedding celebration. They said they would try to do that but couldn’t guarantee it. I arrived at 2 expecting to just drop my bags and was told my room was ready and nobody thought to call me and tell me that. Not once did any member of staff wish me or my new wife congratulations on our marriage despite the fact I hold told them several time the purpose of our stay. For that reason I wouldnt stay again. It was very nice but ultimately staff make a hotel. Not facilities.,"November 25, 2018","26    Lansbury Heritage Hotel

When we entered the restaurant we were surprised to see that the restaurant had so many available tables and were confused why we had to wait 40 minutes. We than had to wait another 15 minutes for the waitress to take our order even though I told her when we sat down we were ready to order. and then another half an hour wait for the food to arrive.

1510,"Although the Hanger Lane Premier Inn is a little way out from the centre of London, its value for money and convenient location made it ideal for us. A short walk via an underpass takes you to the station, which is on the central line and a 20 minute trip to the centre of London. Together with the predictably good quality of the Premier Inn chain, we will certainly use it again.","June 3, 2019","27    Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel

1511,"Stayed here a few weeks ago after a flood in my apartment as it was the closest one to me. Turned up late, stressed and a bit miffed but the staff took good care of me. Nothing was too much trouble for them and rooms were nice. Its all basic but that was all I needed and it was clean. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone in the area and will be using when I have friends visiting from now on.","June 2, 2019","27    Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel

1513,"On arriving at the hotel I found the car park spaces to be very small, even parked with one side inches from the wall the other side was on the line. Check in was good, on walking to the stairs to the rooms I looked out and saw 4 rats in the car park. Room was ok but TV very small for the distance to the seating. Aircon worked well, bed was comfortable and shower amazing. The restaurant was very good. The biggest disappointment was the internet, I had to pay £5 for the enhanced internet as I couldn't get any pages to load using the standard one. This is inexcusable in 2019, obviously they have sufficient capacity to provide a decent service but expect people to pay for it. The last time I paid for internet in a hotel was 2010 and that was also the last time I stayed in a premier inn. Hopefully it will be 9 years before the next time.","May 29, 2019","27    Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel

1514,"We stayed here last week as a base for a three day visit and we were pleased that we had booked outside of the London city area. We haven't stayed at Premier before but we were pleasantly surprised by how good value it was. We managed to find a parking spot and paid £30 for three days, great value.The room was large and bed was good and the bathroom was nice and clean. We requested a fan and this was provided swiftly.We chose to have the breakfast and evening meal deal and the food was plentiful. The breakfasts were very filling and being a buffet it was nice to choose whatever we wanted. I asked the waitress for poached eggs and the chef cooked them for me fresh each morning. I must say a mention to all the staff, who were all very friendly and chatty. The young man behind the bar in the evening was a great example to the hotel. I did ask his name and he told us but I cannot recall it except he said in the south of Italy where his home was his name meant 'happiness' which was what he gave out. Lovely friendly smile and a most polite and welcoming guy. Also the waitress who served us each night. I wish them luck with their futures in the UK. The underground was a couple of minutes away and we had no problems getting around. Next visit to London and we shall stay at this hotel. Great value.

1519,I stay at Premiere Inns quite often for business and sometimes for leisure. I generally find they are a cut above other hotel chains that cater to business travellers. This one is no exception; a very friendly staff and lovely rooms. The beds are always comfortable and the food inthe Di i g room is good. Or much more that you can ask of a hotel when on business. ,"May 16, 2019","27    Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel

The ability to park at the hotel for £10 per 24 hours was also a great help. The hotel is only a 2 minute stroll from the tube at Hanger Lane and 3 minutes from the bus route to Wembley Stadium (483).

1525,"Cost:-This was the cheapest out of all the other Premier Inns west of London that we have stayed at before (Brentford, Chiswick, Wembley,Ealing Broadway ), for the dates we wanted, and the third time we have stayed here over several years.Prices fluctuate according to events and demand.Location:-It is at the end of a service road for a parade of shops..quite hairy getting round the Hanger Lane gyratory system especially at rush hour, then a sharp hairpin left off the southbound A406 into the service road. I recommend checking out the google map on their website if you are not familiar with it.There is now a parking restriction 7am to 7pm outside, so we drove in (barrier raises and system remembers your registration even if you haven’t prebooked). £10 a night. Parking spaces were quite tight, especially as a lot of white vans were parked, and we were glad to have parking sensors as there are pillars and kerbs.Reception/Room:-There were 2 people on reception (training in progress I think), and check-in was quick and efficient, and we were given 2 key cards.The room was the usual excellent standard...clean and comfortable. Wi-fi was a bit iffy..had to keep logging in. There was some noise from the room above late at night .which we worked out was gurgling from their shower.Dinner:-We ate and drank in the Thyme restaurant without booking as it was a Thursday and not too busy.The waitress Monika was friendly and efficient. My sirloin steak was tender and cooked as I’d asked, and the peppercorn sauce I ordered as an extra was very tasty. Skin-on chips, mushrooms and tomato all nice. My husband had the cod and chips. Our only observation would be that the plates and food could have been hotter. The disc of garlic butter I’d agreed to and moved from the steak onto the mushrooms never melted. Just as well we were hungry and ate pretty quickly. The menu mentioned a meal deal for 2courses and drink plus breakfast for £24.99...but gave no details. I thought this probably didn’t include steaks, as mine was not cheap,or a large enough glass of wine! (I later discovered this guess was right..a125 ml house wine is included)so we didn’t ask , but I think that details of what meals were available should be displayed with the menu.Breakfast:-We hadn’t booked breakfast as we were meeting friends for lunch in Soho, but decided to go down for a continental breakfast advertised in the room for £6.99 each. On going down we were charged £7.50 each. When we queried this we were told that it must be an old price list in our room. She wrote down our room number, but in spite of putting it on the bin in our room it was returned to the desk, and was there when we left ..see photo (we put it on the bin again). So the “£8.99 full breakfast” next morning was £9.50 each. Having said this, breakfast is always great. I especially like the bacon, black pudding, croissants and coffee.The plates were nice and hot at breakfast..I had to get my serviette from our table to hold it!The hotel could not be more convenient for Central Line tube. It is accessed down a tunnel from the service road. We timed it ..25 mins to Oxford Circus.","April 25, 2019","27    Premier Inn London Hanger Lane Hotel

1532,"We stayed at this Premier Inn in order to go to the Brighton-Man City game at Wembley arena.When we arrived we had a complication with our room booking (our fault) which was sorted out for us immediately by an incredibly efficient and helpful reception team. In the evening, after our match we walked back from the stadium and arrived to a warm welcome. We decided to eat our evening meal at the hotel and were offered the choice of having it delivered to our room if we wanted to relax in front of the tv. We chose to eat in the dining room however and were served by a top class waitress and waiter who were friendly, polite and efficient. The breakfast team in the morning were similarly as good. We recommend staying here because of the level of service that staff bring. There were a lot of people in the hotel who were visiting Wembley and we felt we really had made the right choice of where to stay. (The stadium was easy to reach on the way there by a direct bus (the 483) from the hotel.

There’s too much to do in the city to do anything but just here sleep anyway...

I will say I was a bit worried about space as my husband and I are more ""Pooh"" sized, but the worries were for nothing. We booked the bigger room and it was phenomenal! A place for luggage, ample storage and hangers, and the most wonderful, roomy, bed!! It was the most comfortable bed we slept in throughout our entire UK trip!! Plus with the bigger room, you are able to have access to both sides of the bed so no crawling over each other. The lounge was nice as well with complimentary coffee and tea all day/night. After a long day sightseeing it was nice to spend time in the lounge and have some tea and discuss the events of the day. The breakfast in the mornings was a great choice as well, with eggs, sausage, bacon, breads/pastries, fruit, yogurt, etc. for only £6. The location of this hub was excellent with St. James' tube stop less than a 5 minute walk and Westminster Abbey just down the road.

The exception was the young lady who booked us in; she obviously had an agenda and declined to talk to me (a male) and looked and talked to my wife, very obviously ignoring me.

1545,"We arrived at the after a short trip on the London Express and the Underground. The St James's Park underground is a block away. Check in was easy. We got the ""bigger"" room, on the 7th floor (Rm 722). Had a small window, and the A/C worked great (very warm that week). Room was a good size for -2-. Couldn't imagine having more than 2 in that room. Bed was very comfy, and plenty of pillows on request. Bathroom spacious. Room was kept clean for our -7- day stay. We got the breakfast included, and it was well worth it. Eggs, bacon, sausage, breads, coffees , teas, etc. Very good. Out the front door, to the left -1- block is Westminster Abbey and a 5 minute walk is the River Thames and Big Ben.

Still, nice place to hang out. We would definitely come back here again. ","July 10, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

1546,"We were impressed from start to finish with the Hub hotel, check inn through to the room was just what we needed for a short city break.The only negative was with th associated bar, it was under staffed, which resulted in long queues, barrels not being changed, and glasses not being cleared from the tables.

1548,"We had a ""bigger"" room. I think the beds in the regular rooms are up against the wall and allow access to only one side. The small window in our room had a view of the outside through a small corridor to another window. Definitely better than our inside room on the Queen Mary 2, but just barely. We had trouble controlling the lights but could eventually get them to turn on or off. The 6 Lb. (about $7.65) breakfast was great!

1549,"We booked the Premier hub for the weekend as we were going to see Barbara Streisand at the Hyde Park open air concerts. It was an excellent choice as it catered for our needs right across the board and was populated by delightful accommodating staff. The bedroom was very good, it's small but ideal for the purpose. The bed is extremely comfortable and it was a very relaxing place. If we had used our heads we would have had breakfast there but we assumed it was just a continental breakfast! (Aren't we stoopid?!, accent on the stupid there) It wasn't but never mind we'll know next time. The next time we stay in a hub we will be prepared and have a full English. Excellent location, excellent quality and service. We paid £52.00 for the night in July in the centre of London! Beat that!","July 9, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

1555,"So I’m a big fan of Premier Inn’s, including the Hub brand, and use them often for business and personal travel. Just checked into the Westminster Premier Inn Hub on Tothill Street in London. It’s my second or third time here, and I think the location is great, and perfect for my office. However, just checked into room 114 and the air con was throwing a really horrible cheesy feet smell, as well as hot air (and it’s really warm outside). So I go down and mention this to the front desk, and I get told by the lady on duty that she has reset it. I go back to the room and it has made no difference. Still hot air and an awful smell. So I go back down again and this time am curtly asked whether I’ve used anything in the room. When I reply that I have not, I get told I they will get me a new room if I go and get my stuff. So back up I go a third time, get my bags and come and get the key for a new room. No ‘sorry, about that’ from the front desk. So off to my new room I go - and it is right in the back in the basement, in the absolute bowels of the building. The hall carpets looks unhoovered, no mobile signal and really tucked away. All a bit grim. I get these are cheap and cheerful rooms, and good value for central London, but for £130 a night, I do expect a working AC and a modicum of customer service. If you are tempted to use this hotel for business, don’t bother - leave it to the tourists who are willing to put up with more in return for the central location.

1556,"Stayed over three nights in early July - hadn't realised that it was Pride weekend when we booked to attend the Hyde Park concerts but this hotel was reasonably priced and well located so seemed to be worth a punt when the usual suspects were uneconomic.All in, a great stay with a high quality but no frills experience. The ground floor room we stayed in (46) had no window but didn't feel claustrophobic with plenty of well angled lighting and a sense of space with the clean, white decor. The capsule style bed was cozy and plenty big enough for two with clever use of space at the foot end to allow for a desk and plenty of storage below.The air conditioning was very effective, the water pressure in the shower was more than adequate and the quality of sound insulation was better than many London hotels we've previously stayed at.Recommended!","July 7, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

The breakfast at £6 is great a value, although the scrambled egg was rather over cooked and dried out, but for I feel I’m being a bit picky at this price.I’ve stayed in other budget hotels in the area but would choose to stay here again if needing a hotel in this part of London.","July 4, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

1567,"I stayed with my wife whilst in London to visit Wimbledon. We chose the Hub due to good reviews and due to it being at least 1/3rd cheaper than nearby 4* hotels. Whilst not cheap (£200 per night) I appreciate that London prices, whilst always high, are even worse during Wimbledon fortnight.It was our first stay at a Premier Inn ‘Hub’ hotel and we were impressed given the competitive rate. The room, whilst compact, had ample space for us, was spotlessly clean and had a huge and very comfortable bed. A 100% blackout blind, great sound insulation and efficient air con ensured a great night’s sleep.Breakfast, whilst simple, was fresh and tasty and represented excellent value for money at £6. (I hate paying the c £15-20 that 4-5* hotels want to charge for a simple breakfast).The staff were friendly and welcoming. I’d recommend the Hub Westminster and whilst not quite as ‘cool’ as ‘Citizen M’ hotels the ‘Hub’ is a similar concept and very well executed by Premier Inn.","July 4, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

1568,"Fantastic location! The room was clean and tidy. Given it's a Hub I expected it to be small and it was (paid for the bigger room upgrade, we had two rooms and one did seem bigger than the other.....). The TV remote was hit and miss which became quite annoying and it was tricky to control the heating. Didn't expect to have to make the bed myself on arrival but perhaps that's par for the course with a premier inn hub. Bed was very comfortable, and the shower was excellent! One of the biggest downsides was the lack of any tea making facilities. If this had been clear when booking, we could have purchased a cheap travel kettle. Free tea and coffee is available but that means trekking downstairs and bringing it back to your room.It's expensive for what it is but then when you consider the location the price is probably just about justified. The breakfast was superb value! By far the biggest plus point is the staff, every member we encountered was professional, courteous and extremely polite and helpful.Knowing what we know now and being able to prepare better we would definitely stay again.

1584,The hub is a really well designed room and as a base for a couple of nights is ideal.we have used a hub for another city break and will definitely use one again. The only problem we had and it's nothing to do with the hub. .The underground station close to the hub hotel was not operating on the weekend due to engineering works. It meant a longer walk to use the underground at Westminster. No issue if it's not raining.,"June 29, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

1587,"Stayed for one night. Plus'sTHE STAFF.Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, was lovely (management take note). We only knew Kiara's name from checking us in but I could have named anyone.LOCATION.Turn right and Westminster Abbey is right there in front of you, about a 3 minute stroll away. St. James Park underground is a 2 minutes walk away, Westminster about 7 minutes. So close to a lot of things but relatively quiet. Within a 15 minute easy stroll, you have Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, London Eye, St.James Park.....it's great.BREAKFAST. £6 for all you can eat, this knocked spots off 5* London hotels I've stayed in (my reviews have been taken down due to change of ownership - I'm not happy). Great sausages, bagels, cakes, fresh fruit salad (not tinned) bean to cup coffee. It's self service but food was replenished regularly. You normally hear someone complain about something, I didn't hear anyone. NigglesTHE ROOM.It's fine and had 5 plug sockets and what looked like a US socket as well....but the bed is a bit high and you have to climb on to it and is up against a wall on 3 sides. A problem if there are two of you and the one nearest the wall has to visit the bathroom in the night. The wash basin is also high and I could imagine water running down the arms of anyone around 5 foot tall. That said, the bed was comfortable and the shower was fine.The in-house bar was still serving drinks in what was a relaxed atmosphere at 12.30am when we left. There are also a couple of pubs nearby. Free tea and coffee is available 24hrs. We've just booked again for September so it can't be all that bad.","June 26, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

Westminster tube was just along the road although we didn't use this and Victoria tube was about 15 minutes walk. Few bars around although get very busy around end of working day. Very near to Westminster Abbey and close to Downing Street. Rooms we're very good. Clean, comfortable and adequate for a vase to stay. Shower gel provided. And good hairdryer. Good full length mirror in bedroom and large one in bathroom Shower powerful. Towels changed and rooms cleaned as required. Also plenty of hangers. Enough for a free days if you double up and although wardrobe is just an enclosure there are 2 hanging rails. We also had bottled water supplies. Room was very modern and touch display for loghts etc. The only negative is that we wanted to use the hub display and control lights from our phone but engineer didn't know why we couldn't work it.

1620,"INCREDIBLE experience in this hotel. Everything was amazing: the location, the friendly staff, the room and service for it's quality/price. I've stayed in this hotel for 17 nights at the end of April - May. Everything worked smoothly since the beggining as I've requested an early check in and a room with a window in advance, and I got all of that without any issue. I've stayed in a bigger room as I thought that the regular room was too small considering that I was there for 3 weeks. First, the location is just perfect as this hotel is at the heart of London: Westminster Abbey is only 1 block away, The Houses of Parliament 3 blocks away, London eye and Trafalgar Square just a couple of minutes walking. The nearest tube station is St James's Park (Circle and District Line), just 1 block away from the hotel, and the Westminster station (Jubilee Line) is about 3 blocks away.About the room, I can see It's exactly how it looks on the pictures posted in this site. It's very well designed, modern and clean. The bed is very confortable and the panel where you can control the lights and temperature is the star of the room. Actually, it's very handy. I've read many comments complaining about the size of the room, and I knew beforehand that it was going to be a small room comparing to other from other hotels, but I never felt it was an issue for me. On top of that, it has a very useful under-bed storage and they provide you with towels and a new duvet every day. Free complimentary water the first day as well. The breakfast it's served on the Lounge and it's very cheao: only 6 pounds! It's a buffet breakfast and it has a lot of options to choose from. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Jorge was super friendly and chatty. Amazing experience. I'm looking forward to go back!!","June 14, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

1621,"We appreciated the impeccable cleanliness down to the smallest things, including changing the air filters in the rooms, the new set of sheets after three days during our six night stay, the unbeatable value of the £6 breakfast with delicious eggs, sausage, bacon and bread and the complimentary coffee and tea. The breakfast option made a huge difference for us as we were on the last leg of a three week trip and having this option was the most affordable for quality meal we could find anywhere in London - the perfect thing to set the day off right (and didn’t close so early that we could sleep in on some days).Not to mention the location! Half a block from Westminster Abbey and from St James Station, it was so central we could enjoy our trip to the fullest using a 7-day Oyster card. We stayed in one of the new “larger” rooms and the only thing we’d recommend is having a second seating option in the room, having more lighting options to have the bed dark but the lights on full in the toilet (so that one person can sleep while the other showers), having the app available to international App stores for those not from the UK (we’re from Canada) and a very minor thing of having the hand soap pump on the same side of the counter as the sink so that there’s less risk of dripping onto the counter. And having tissue boxes available from the vending machine in the lobby (we had allergies while we were there - not a big deal as we just found some at the local Tesco instead).It was wonderful peace of mind staying in a place that obviously thought about cleanliness and with the room layout also very well thought out. Will definitely look to stay here again! Hope to see this chain expand internationally!","June 14, 2019","28    hub by Premier Inn London Westminster Abbey

1625,Stayed one night before our early start on Eurostar. Wow what a surprise. A very small room with a huge cabin style bed and storage for suitcases. Everything was operated on a touch screen. Bathroom with walk in shower. It was all very clean. Will definitely check this out for our next visit to London. Very disappointed in the area though and the amount of litter on the streets. A disgusting sight for tourists to have to look at. ,"July 12, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

The location was ideal, the hotel is clean, modern, sleek and fantastic value for money. The hub rooms are compact but with absolutely everything you require. I had a great sleep despite being on the main road and directly across form King's Cross station. The shower room was great. loads of hot water, great pressure, free toiletries, nice big towels and two big shower heads. The £5 continental breakfast was ideal and there is free tea and coffee available 24 hours.#I would not hesitate to recommend the hub and will def use again.","July 10, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

1629,"We stayed for two nights the first weekend of July as we were in London for a gig at Hyde Park.First off,for a charity donation we could drop our bags before our check in time as we arrived first thing-nice touch.Our room was small but clean, comfortable, and everything was bright and modern.We were there for the weekend and only slept in the room, so we didn’t need spacious.If you want a suite, and room to sit around, you wouldn’t book a hub room.Breakfast was great for a fiver, we pre-booked it, but you can buy on the day.All you can eat too.Fresh fruit, pastries, toast etc-continental style.Nothing cooked, apart from porridge I believe.The staff were very helpful and couldn’t do enough.If you are after a good clean room in a great location, and not bothered about having somewhere to sit around in, then the Hub @KingsCross is a great option at a very good price.I’ll stay here again the next time i’m in London.","July 9, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

1633,"We were attending an event in London's Kings Cross area on a Sunday and didn't have to travel home until Monday. As the Saturday night stay at the Hub was nearly three times the price of a Sunday, we booked for Sunday and arrived early enough to have one of the Hub's breakfasts before booing in at 2pm. The all-you-can-eat breakfasts are amazing value compared with the many chains offering over-priced coffee in the surrounding area. We were also taking advantage of the abundant free on street parking in the area over the weekend but made sure we were back on the road by 8.30am on the Monday when the draconian parking fees kick in. The staff were all very helpful and the rooms immaculately clean. This was our second weekend stay at the Hub in Kings Cross.

1643,"This is copy/pasted from my review that will go directly to the hotel:The room I was allocated (7) was far too hot and the cooling, set to 18 degrees, simply did not work. After ten mins of listening to the heat exchanger attempt to cool down I discovered only about 1cm in the top right corner was working, suggesting insufficient coolant. I note there were coolant leak detectors at floor level so the possibility and expectation of leaks must have been designed into the building. I asked to move room but the lady at reception tried to tell me the air conditioning to my room might have been off centrally. She told me to go and wait 20 mins in my room (this was around midnight). I returned as there was no cooling effort at all. She said the hotel was fully booked and I couldn't move room, nor could I try to move to a nearby Premier Inn, should one have had room. She said they were separate companies. A manager overheard the conversation and moved me to room 51. On starting the air conditioning, set to 18, within a minute gurgling was heard and slightly more of the heat exchanged became cold than in room 7 (so an improvement), but again, I suspect there was insufficient coolant present. The heat exchanger should get quite cold and wet when in operation in a warm humid environment. The room was far too hot all night. I really was not impressed with my stay and I suspect faults are now starting to appear that are not being rectified now these new-build hotels are ageing.","July 3, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

Would highly recommend.","June 23, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

1669,"I'm a big fan of Premier Inn not because they're amazing but they are absolutely reliable and always clean and comfortable. Was a bit wary of the hub concept but after some reassurance I stayed 2 nights here and found it really good. Single room had a very large and comfortable bed, a clever pull out desk which was perfect for a laptop, and a really nice en-suite shower room. Free tea and coffee 24/7 in the bar downstairs. What more do you need? Only negative was a somewhat noisy room due to a gurgling aircon or drainage system but it didn't bother me really. Would definitely use again for business trips.","June 22, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

1670,All services great other than faulty aircon in the room. It's very loud and sounds broken. The room was very hot as we had to turn it off to try and sleep. Unfortunately we couldn't get to sleep due to the heat. We slept with no covers on and still were too hot. To top it off the aircon kept turning itself on every so often so when we managed to drift off for a second it woke us back up again so we had to keep turning it off. Room 6004.

1671,"New experience and a great welcome from staff - unlike the premier inn down the road where I went by mistake. Warm, helpful. Good breakfast for the price. Good shower and hotel was in good condition. Couldn’t complain about anything had two wonderful staff members at the bar to greet me when I walked in I think there names were joão and Betina lovely smiles and very helpful could say they made my morning. So I hope I’ve said there names right because they deserve it very nice people both of them even helped with my bags when reception was so busy.","June 22, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

1673,"I was welcomed by an amazingly lovely happy lady named Betina who could not be more helpful! The hotel itself is modern and really nice, with a cocktail bar next door what more could you want!! Everything is controlled by a remote and it’s free WiFi, feels so futuristic almost. ","June 21, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

1674,Spent one night here this week and was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were small but perfectly formed. Configuration of the double bed wouldn't suit all. Checking in was different [fully automated with someone on standby if you got stuck]. Breakfast for a fiver next day was a revelation. Seemed to be popular with business people due to location and great value.,"June 21, 2019","29    hub by Premier Inn London King's Cross

1676,Me and my partner really enjoyed our stay at the hub it was fantastic would highly recommend it. had a great staff member João that had a few minutes to talk to us about GOSH and convinced us to also leave the tip of five pounds that we wanted to give to him to the charity pot that they had a the bar.
