      "  review_body : For all the amenities provided, this place was a tremendous value for price paid.I loved that it was in a less touristy area yet so convenient with the Place de Clichy Metro stop a quick walk away.Fabulous bakery just across the street, (best Pan au Chocolat I've ever had!) as well a a larger food market and small organic-type grocery right next door. The bonus of the shared refrigerator and microwave in the communal kitchen made it easy to catch a quick bite if we did not feel like dining out. Although, with all of the little cafes right on the street, great meals were a quick stroll away.Rooms are small but kept immaculately clean...which was all we needed. Ours looked over a quaint courtyard so street noise was never an issue.There is one SMALL elevator, but we only used it the days of check in and check out and opted for the stairs instead other times.I cannot say enough about the friendly and helpful staff. They forgave my VERY LIMITED knowledge of the French language and easily communicated with me in English. Our overnight flight had us getting to hotel at 10am, and while room was not ready, we were able to enjoy coffee and tea so we could wake up!, then stored our luggage and walked around the neighborhood to get the lay of the land. Sacre Coeur and Moulin Rouge very short distance away.I would not hesitate in the least to stay at the Hotel Darcet on any future trips to Paris\n",

Its 24-hour check-in made coming and going a breeze, and the multilingual staff were all friendly and helpful. I was surprised by all the amenities on offer, given the low rate that I was charged for a two-night stay. These perks included complimentary coffee and tea downstairs, a communal refrigerator and microwave, and a television and blowdryer in the room itself. WiFi was also free, as was one bottle of mineral water per night. Rooms were exceptionally clean and well-maintained, and windows offered pleasant street views. I usually stay with friends when I am in Paris, but if I am ever unable to, I would stay here again with nary a second thought. Hôtel Darcet is clean, convenient, and walking distance from dozens of exciting cultural and historic sites. What more could one want? Many thanks to the staff for a lovely stay.\n",

Even though I booked through an external website, the staff went out of their way to try to help me cancel the rest of my stay. They could have chosen to just say no, but they went the extra mile to help.The hotel seems super clean. When I was walking up the stairs, I saw the 4 cleaning staff tackling the daily clean, including *wiping down the outside of the guest doors.* At what hotel have you ever seen this done?? I was really impressed.I would have preferred it if I didn't have to leave my key at the front desk whenever I departed; as a person traveling alone that made me uncomfortable. However, the desk does stay open 24 hours and the staff were ready with the key when I returned. Also, the rooms are indeed small, so if you are traveling with a family, I wouldn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room itself.I would definitely return in the future.\n",

We checked in, and Wahlly (I hope I am spelling his name right, but he is an exchange student and younger gentleman) checked us in. He was the sweetest person we met all week in Paris. He was so accommodating, and throughout our stay we only saw him at check in, and we liked him so much we wanted to say goodbye, so surprise, when we checked out, he was working (at 6:00am). Such a lovely guy. Throughout our stay, Sameer, was amazing as well, and so was the lady at reception as well as the other gentleman who helped us out with absolutely everything; from restaurant recommendations (which were all on point) to taking the time in giving us the best directions to busses, trains and main attractions. Besides the hotel being super close to everything (you are literally three blocks from Moulin Rouge), it was so clean, they always have coffee, tea and if you want to store anything they have a fridge and microwave. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are in the city for a night or for a long stay. You will not be disappointed. Highly recommended.

      "  review_body : The Darcet has been refurbished to a high standard, the fabric and decoration is to a high standard, though nothing fancy. The standard of housekeeping is also to a high standard, though in our experience room cleaning took place in the late afternoon even when we were out all day. Our room #17, was of adequate size. The beds are extremely firm, too firm for our liking and had the feel of a memory foam matress , though much firmer than our own memory foam matresses at home - almost too hard for us.The TV system had a good number of English and American TV channels, and of course many French.The window on to the street was double glazed and fitted with an external shutter, which effectively reduced the street noise to a tolerable level. The window was large and gave the room plenty of daylight.The lift is extremely small, barely enough room for two people, which could be an issue for anyone with a tendency to claustrophobia.We knew that breakfast was not served at the Darcet, but there are several good cafes and restaurants nearby which we tried, so this was not as issue for us. Also there is kitchen and an area to eat your bought in food which we also used.The staff are very helpful and can communicate well in English.We liked the surrounding area of Boulevard de Batignolles very much, as it is not touristic and has a good variety of bars and restaurants which are used mostly by Parsiens. The Place de Clichy metro is just three minutes walk away. We went to the late show at the Moulin Rouge and walked back at 1am, feeling perfectly safe in this area. (Only 10 minutes walking distance)So in summary Hotel Darcet was a good choice for a stay of four days in Paris, we would recommend this hotel for its location and for travellers who expect a decent standard of accommodation but don't require anything fancy.\n",

The good: Rooms were very clean, windows have roulades that totally block out light, beds were comfortable, plenty of hot water for showers, free tea and coffee, use of a kitchen, close proximity to the metro. The not so good: no view, far from most major attractions, the way reservations were handled. I booked one double room and one triple room. I had to show the actual email from the booking at arrival to prove that I did not book two triples. I believe that all they had left were triples so they were trying to get me to pay the up charge for a room I did not want. When I checked out I again had to prove that I did not book two triples. The refrigerator was available for guests but it was so loaded with bits and pieces of meals that I would not consider using it. Rooms are modest but so is the price. Overall for budget travelers I would recommend Hotel Darcet.\n",

Location was only average and not close to anything (although there were a few cafe's around)The lift can only fit one person ... yep, 1 person at a time!You needed to carry your bag up 4 steps to even get to the lift. Not easy when the bag is 30kgNo breakfast available. There was a common area where you can put your own food in a shared fridge in you wanted. Yeah right ... like I'm going to do that.Room was like a hostel ... wait, no, I've stayed in hostels that were much better.Ran out of hot water half way thru the second shower each morning. My wife and I draw stays for the 1st shower.Price was OK, but for what it is, should be half.People at the front desk were really nice and courteous and doing their best.Summery: Find somewhere else.\n",

There was an offer of free tea and coffee, to use the kitchen facilities if we wanted anything at anytime. Samir gave us a free large bottle of water on arrival and two smaller bottles for our journey home.He was a gentleman. The location was a couple of metro stops away from the centre, and there was never a problem. Thank you for helping make my birthday weekend surprise, even more memorable.

      "  review_body : Booked to stay for 1 week. Had a terrible check in process. The receiving staff was rude. I gave plenty of notice with my request but put me on 1st floor, (hotel only have 5 floors) with poor internet connection, it won't even accept the password given to me. He told me specifically which internet to connect and only find out from the owner and other guests that I can connect with better line. He even blamed me that it was my phone and told me that am the only one complaining with the internet. Really? I have been travelling and no issues with my internet in other countries I've been to. Didn't even offer to help me to the lift with my luggages. Then transferred me on the following morning with no notice. Then the owner (Samir) tried to make it up by telling me I can move again only for the last 2 nights on the higher floor. I declined as they should have given my request from the start as I made the reservations more than 2 months before my arrival. They tried to make it up to me by giving me free drinks (softdrinks and water). I kept saying no as I bought my own bottles of water during my stay but insisted. They should notify you if your request can not be granted before your arrival.The rooms are very small but clean. you will have to lay your suitcase on the floor. You can hear ppl talk in the nearby neighbourhood. Free coffee but no milk in the common dining room. You have to buy your milk for your coffee. As a paying customer, I always look for good customer service.\n",

      "  review_body : We booked online and found the initial communication with the hotel (via email and in english) to be very helpful. The hotel staff asked when we would arrive so that they could ensure that a room was ready. When we arrived, we were greeted kindly and told that our room was available. There was a small elevator to take us to our room (think 1 or 2 people small). The room was clean and well kept. The bathroom is small but functional and had wall mounted liquid soap dispensers in the shower and by the sink. The windows and AC kept the room cool and we found the area to be quiet, even with the windows open at night. There was a small closet in the room that contained a safe, which we did not use. There is a small, wall-mounted, desk area too. You are allowed to use a common-area kitchen and refrigerator on the ground floor, but we did not do that. For breakfast you can visit the corner boulangerie or, if you want something better, you can find a better boulangerie a few blocks away. There were a couple of grocery stores nearby that we made good use of (I found Auchan to be convenient and on the way to the hotel from the Place de Clichy metro). Getting to/from the hotel was not an issue, it is about 3 blocks from Place de Clichy metro, and, if you are up for a walk - Gare Saint Lazare is within reach (15 min walk). I thought this was a great little hotel. Cheap, simple, and French. I enjoyed the staff as well, always friendly, but here to run the front desk - not to serve as a concierge. We stayed for a total of 4 nights and would stay here again. NOTE: each night we were here the hotel was completely booked. Make sure you book ahead of time. Don't expect to get a room as a walk-in.\n",

Good shutters on the windows meant we could sleep with the windows open but still be dark. The area is okay, between Rome-Batignolles and Place de Clichy metro stations, so great for getting around Paris and surprisingly quiet at night. The second night was noisier with sirens but that was the night of the Notre-Dame fire, the windows blanked the sound and the room fan was okay to keep the room cool. Free tea and coffee in the dining room, the hotel doesn’t offer breakfast or other meals but there is a kitchen where you can keep your own food and a microwave.

      "  review_body : I arrived here for a couple night stay on a city break and was a little deterred by a slightly untidy frontage and reception area. Further in, the elevator is like something out the 1940s - it says it will accommodate 2 people. I would dispute this, certainly if either of them had a bag!Anyone with mobility issues needs to check this though - as discussed the lift is very narrow and there is a spiral staircase which isnt particularly even. I didnt see other access but i wasnt really looking. However, having got past some initial reticence i was very impressed with this. The hotel staff couldnt have done more for me and the room was pretty good. I had a single which was well looked after, was comfortable and had plenty of room. Air con worked well, which doesnt always happen. For the money I paid, I thought this was very good value. In terms of geography, Paris is a big place so it depends what you want to see. This is about 25 minute walk from Gare du Nord and 25/30 minute walk from Arc de Triomphe/ eiffel tower. Its very close to Sacre Coeur. Personally, Id happily come back here.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed for two night and we were glad to stay in this hotel. Very convenience to metro and bus, 1 minutes walk to number 30 bus stop which go to Sacre Couer (east) or Tour Eiffel (west). Five minutes bus ride to Anvers (Sacre Couer) and about 30 minutes bus ride to Tour Eiffel during rush hour. Number 30 bus comes every 8 minutes during day time. I prefer not taking the close-by metro because it is more interesting taking bus. Restaurant and bakery are everywhere and a few of them close at 2am. Not so good for early bird because place not open at least 7am but it is understandable for the late closing.The real gem of the hotel is their staff and they were so helpful, gave us lot of tourist tips in Paris. Big applause for Zion (day staff), Samir (night staff), Khalifa (morning staff). We learned a lot even we did not talk for long.This is a budgetary two-star hotel in Paris and everything were as expected. It wouldn't be fair to compare to a 3 or 4-star hotel. Having boiling drinking water was so convenience because of the shared kitchen. The 24 hours complementary nescafe alike coffee and tea were great. Cell phone signal and wifi in the hotel can be spotty. Our jacket and backpack got pick pocketed while having dinning in the restaurant close-by. They guy sit behind us pretended to be fixing his long jacket while he went through our stuff instead. We did not lose much because we put the valuable and passport in the hotel safe. We did report to the police station which was within 5 minutes walking distance.We would definitely come back to the hotel again in the near future.\n",

I was early for check-in but was offered coffee in the small but effective off-lobby area. Whilst waiting was very impressed with the receptionist dealing with fellow guests in the most helpful manner. When shown my room I was delighted with a spacious and spotlessly clean room with an extremely comfortable mattress. I had an excellent undisturbed night (very efficient double glazing) and a great shower. The hotel does not offer breakfast (fine by me since I rarely take breakfast) but you are directed to good looking bakery opposite and it is in an area with all sorts of eating options including well-stocked supermarkets. Close to Metro, this hotel has no frills but is ideal for a traveller such as myself who just wants basic cleanliness, comfort and a very warm helpful welcome. Couldn't ask for more.\n",

A good and comfy stay overall!CheersCrespo & Sarah\n",

      "  review_body : We had bookings from 8-10 Nov. We had requested and got confirmation for the Eiffel view room a week before our stay. Today we arrived at 11 and they said that early check in is not available, which is ok. We spent our 3 hours out and when we came back at 2.15, the room was still not ready for check-in. The official time of check-in is 2pm and even at 2.46pm they need more 30 mins to make the room. All they have to arrogantly say is that if you want that room, you have to wait. I don't see any reason to wait beyond the official check-in time. Not at all professional. If you are crunched with time and have to make the most of time in Paris, this is definitely not the hotel you should stay at.\n",

      "  review_body : Well I read some reviews before I came that we’re saying this hotel wasn’t pleasant. Honestly from the moment we entered untill we checked out it was nothing but positive. We stayed in a Queen room travailing as a party of 4 (myself and 11 year old daughter and my friend and her son same age)The reception is amongst a bar/bistro was very welcoming and given it was past 10pm we were still greeted with a friendly and helpful staff. Our room on the 7th floor was spacious, spotless clean and had some extras we wasn’t expecting in the form of the children having sweets and a Eiffel Tower keyring on there bed and the adults robe and slippers. The mini bar was free and stocked with branded drinks of water, cola and juices. Again a lovely touch. Location wise it was a 42 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower on the maps app on our phone. Although a pleasant and straightforward walk if you have mobility issues like me once you do the walk n sightsee it’s hard. Taxi to it was 15 euro. We used the Metro from CDG airport it was very straightforward and took us to a stop that was 15 mins from the hotel again a very straight walk. We had breakfast on the second day for the 4 of us it was €36 euro and it was a buffet style. Having 2 fussy kids we were amazed the amount of choice and filled up everything was fresh and tasty and the kids were made up as a Magician was around doing tricks! There was a free photo booth to take holiday selfies and print them off there too. We had room service too one night of pizza and few drinks. Again we didn’t feel over charged and food was good, hot and fresh.All the staff encountered were friendly and helpful we had a great 2 night stay. Would definitely recommend!To use the metro from the airport it was 20+ euros and a taxi was 50 hope this helps! \n",

I booked two rooms and requested the rooms to be near to each other, one room for my parent and one room for me and my siblings. Their rooms exceeded my expectation! And free breakfast was the best! Their chefs, staffs and food were fantastic! We were so happy! Staffs were helpful and helping us to book the taxi! I would suggest this to every international traveller! Merci Novotel Paris!\n",

My family was given two mid-sized adjacent rooms but not connecting despite repeated requests before and during our 7-night stay. Wi-fi worked great. WC or toilet was in a separate room from the sink and shower. Showers were weak, not particularly hot, and leaky (on the floor). Sinks were super shallow without a soap dish.Hotel caters to family as evidenced by the somewhat chaotic breakfast buffet. Lots of variety with good selection of fruits. A good start to our day. Rooms were surprisingly quiet. And clean -- we saw a carpet cleaning crew. But be careful of their card keys -- they tend to erase when near metro cards or cell phones.\n",

Many guests had to wait 15 mins to be taken to a table as the restaurant was crowded. Once there, you have to wait again for cups, mugs, juice refill, pastries... Same scenario on the second day but things got better on the 3rd day.I didn’t bother checkout as the queue was very long and I would have missed my train so I left the keys in the box.I don’t know whether they had a shortage of staff or whether they lacked efficiency but I was not impressed by the waiting staff nor those at reception and not even by the cleaning staff who never greeted us in the corridors unless we did it first.Sorry, I didn’t feel welcome at your hotel! \n",

The breakfast was abundant and there was everything you could ask for. The service was friendly and all in all this was good value for the money, although the location good have been more central as it was a bit difficult to navigate with public transport.\n",

The atmosphere in the hotel was good with the majority of the staff speaking English and always being happy to help whenever possible. The downstairs has a large tv which showed the football and other things, a large buffet restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and a long bar serving drinks all day everyday. The standard double room we stayed in was a good size with a bathroom and separate toilet. It had a large tv, coffee machine, an iron, a safe and plenty of cabinets, drawers and tables for storage space. The view from our window wasn’t great showing the back car park and railway track from the station but there is an option to pay for a city view room. Overall the experience was good, but I didn’t try the food or drink from downstairs because of the extremely high prices, hence a four star rather than five, but this hotel is perfect for a short stay for anyone! \n",

Great restaurants and shopping around the area and you don't get gouged like in the more central touristy areas.Expect smaller rooms typical of most older Europeiean cities. Micro showers... I am not a big person and I kept turning the water off when I turned around in the shower... Also minimal toiletries.The breakfast was nice and has everything you might want to start the day, including a personal pot of coffee.The staff was exceptional.

I assume this is because I was given the corner room, by the staircase which was arranged differently to accommodate the location. Once I got over the room, I figured I need to just accept it. However, the next morning, I was awakened by noise in the roof, (I was on the 5th floor). I called downstairs and they said that the guys were in the attic, conveniently located above my roof, working. Then the front desk called me a few minutes after and suggested I came downstairs and spend about 10 minutes in the lobby because they will be setting off the fire alarm and it would be better for me to not be in the room. I was the only one to receive this call. Other than the small room, noisy day, the staff was tremendously kind and helpful. They serve breakfast which consists of boiled eggs, croissants, ham, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, butter and a little treat. \n",

      "  review_body : My husband and I stayed six nights at the Hotel du Printemps and were delighted with the hotel, the staff, and the services offered. The office staff members were all extremely friendly - helpful with directions, with recommending neighborhood restaurants, and with any questions that we had. While the guest rooms are small, they are well-equipped with a room safe and a very hot and powerful shower. We had a room on the fifth floor overlooking the street outside - a lovely view. Morning breakfast was part of our hotel package - my FAVORITE feature was the commercial machine that made individual cups of coffee, espresso, cappucino, latte, etc. and was self-serve. There were croissants, pastries, baquettes, and other sliced breads every morning with gourmet fruit spreads, Nutella, butter, cream cheese, etc. along with hams, cheeses, muesli and granola, fresh fruit, fresh eggs with a cooker to boil your own, yogurts, etc. The area is small, but seemed to work fine most of the time as there is a three hour window of service. The hotel is a five minute walk from one metro line and less than ten minutes to the Nation metro station, which has multiple metro lines and RER (faster suburb trains that make less stops) lines. We purchased the Passe Navigo weekly pass and could get anywhere we wanted in less than 30 minutes. We enjoyed being able to go out to all the tourist areas, but to come back to the neighborhood at night for dinner. The restaurants catered to the local French people (we were the only English-speaking patrons in each restaurant, but the wait staff always spoke enough English to help us out) - we had some wonderful meals (shout out to Le Picotin and our absolute favorite, Le Millau, plus if you want the best tiramisu on the planet, visit Amalfi just down the street). On Wednesday and Saturday, there was also a open air market one block away that was delightful. In addition, there are cafes and boulangeries on every street, a couple of groceries within a couple of blocks, and if you fancy French department stores, Printemps is only a five minute walk away. We would love to return to Paris and Hotel du Printemps.\n",

A more cozy and friendly place than any other budget hotel, a friendly service that speaks English and Spanish fluently. The rooms are not that small, bigger than usual Parisian hotel with wardrobe. And a good size bathroom too.\n",

The rooms are small and the bathroom is a challenge (the shower is tiny) but there is plenty of hot water and some toiletries if you need them. The beds are really comfortable and the air conditioning is super. There is a lovely patio area where we had coffee and wine but there aren't any balconies. It isn't very far from two subway stops but it is a fair way out of town so getting anywhere takes some time. All in all excellent value\n",

It's not near the popular tourist sites but it is close to several train stations so I could get wherever I needed to go quickly. The staff/customer service was great (on property and online). I misunderstood the payment/city tax and made several inquiries. This was completely my fault but they were patient and willing to explain as many times as needed for me to understand. I'm sure it was annoying to them but they never showed it. Huge plus. The breakfast is a bit pricey but I took advantage because of convenience. They did have a nice selection. I would love to stay there again. It's a great little gem.\n",

      "  review_body : I've just spent a wonderful weekend in Paris with my family and it was made all the better for the fact that we stayed at the Printemps. My sister found the hotel via the internet and what a find it was. We needed to be close to the Gare de Lyon and the Bercy concert hall so it was perfectly situated near the Place de Nation that has many metro, bus and RER lines running from it. From Loretta on the front desk during the day to Kevin at night and the whole team (especially the breakfast ladies who were so friendly and helpful) the welcome was just wonderful. Our room was very clean, quiet and comfortable.....not always an easy find in Paris unless you have a massive budget! And the breakfast was fabulous and set us up for the day. I can't recommend this hotel enough and I will certainly be going back. Well done Loretta and the team you're doing an excellent job! \n",

Traveling with my wife and kids from USA and we do not speak any French. No need all staff spoke very good English and eager to help. Loretta, Antonio and Wada all went above and beyond in delivering Exceptional Service everyday. They explained everything from how to hop on Le Metro subway to zip to the Effel Tower- one train- 20 minutes to how to complete the ID Passes for unlimited Metro Train, bus and related public transportation us. A big deal because I'd your picture is not affixed to Unlimited Pass with your name written in the correct place, and you need a photocopy of your Passport- then when you get of train to exit transportation officials audit you and it is $35 Euro fee per person! We did get stopped but thanks to Wada front the hotel front desk making photo copies and helping us construct ID for Unlimited Passes we we in the clear! Others were getting fines! Many others lines of them. Finally breakfasts are lovely, rooms and entire hotel completed renovated maintaining the classic historic feel, water pressure and temperature outstanding (my daughter has very long think hair so water pressure and volume much appreciated, entire hotel immaculently clean and in perfect repair, neighborhood sidewalk is very quiet with little car traffic but lots of foot traffic. Our room #14 had a wonderful view of trees and sidewalk. Lots of sidewalk cafes, restaurants, bars, bakeries! and grocery stores within 30 seconds walk. I appreciated the variety and some we quite inexpensive and others were mid range. I saw no Americans and all local French people and they were very friendly as this is a neighborhood. Great parking right outside hotel on street. Took Metro line at all times of day bouncing between Eiffel Tower to here- and my kids easy did it by themselves. They are 15 years and 14 years boy and girl. Very SAFE and Pleasant.\n",

      "  review_body : This was our first trip to Paris and I could not be happier with our stay. As I was on a budget and did not want to screw this up and have my wife upset, I read tons of reviews. I can say without hesitation that this hotel exceeded all my expectations and in a perfect clean and safe location for seeing all the sights. There is a grocery store across the street for wine and cheese and plenty of great restaurants within a 5 minute walk. (I recommend Cafe Cosy and Royal VI Nation) The rooms look like they're brand new and the beds were very comfortable. It's a 90 second walk to the Picpus Metro Station.(Subway). There is a large Metro Map in the Lobby and the front desk staff showed us everything we needed to know. Breakfast was included in our stay and I loved it, but I learned that it is optional when you book. If you do not include it in your stay, it's 9 euro. The rooms are smaller than us Americans are accustomed to, but that's part of the charm of Paris. Besides, who goes to Paris to sit in a Hotel Room? We met another couple there and stayed 6 nights. The front lobby has tables, a couch and lounge chairs that we used every night to sit and catch up on old times and reflect on what we did that day. Yusef at the front desk was outstanding and made us feel like we were sitting around our own home. He would get us wine glasses and ice. Everything was super clean and everyone treated us like gold. As the power is 220 volts there and different plugs, I took my own adapter, but they do provide adapters for free with a 10 euro deposit. They also have a 110 volt american plug on the wall mount hairdryer base, however, both sides are for the small prong, so you will need to butcher the prong on your hair straightner or buy a 220 volt one. They have an iron and ironing board if you request it. We had a couple conversations with the couple that own the hotel during our stay. They are delightful and you can tell that they strive for providing a quality experience for their guests. Do not hesitate to book this hotel, you will not regret it. Can't wait to go back!\n",

Furthermore, around the hotel lies several varieties of stores (food, clothes, supermarket) which is quite good for a quick visit. The location is very strategic due to its placement between two metro stations, Nation (lies on the RER A and Line 1 which is one of the primary lines for transport) and Picpus, so travel is not an issue at all.We used a triple room, and the room itself was very, very spacious (considering Parisian standards!), clean, and the beds were comfortable. There's also a safe box for your personal belongings. Internet connection was fast, and for people who watch TV the choice of channels were quite good (a mixture of french and international news channels). The pictures you see advertised in the hotel website/other users' photos are what you get - and it does not disappoint us. We slept very easily here!All the staff were extremely helpful, professional, and very understanding. Our special thanks to Fabien, Youssef, Zdravko and Lorretta (plus the caretaker ladies who made our room perfect every night) who made our trip a truly pleasant experience. The staff here embodies the spirit of professional hospitality and possesses the attitude and qualities of people working customer service must have.Honestly, we could not praise the hotel enough. It should have been a 4 star in our opinion!If we do return to Paris, we will be sure to return and stay here!\n",

      "  review_body : This is my second review for Hotel du Printemps in 14 months. I have spent a total of 20 nights here and have been VERY happy with my choice! The hotel is modern and very tastefully decorated. The foyer is a comfortable and welcoming space to sit with a drink and the owners have a library of lovely books and current magazines to look through. The staff have always been extremely helpful and are more than happy to speak English with guests (which is a relief when my limited French is exhausted!). On this trip my father (whom I was travelling with) became ill and Loretta was very quick to book an appointment with a local doctor who could speak a little English also. She also helped my dad to construct a statement of his symptoms! Loretta was so kind and helpful, asking every day how Dad was feeling. Camille was also extremely friendly and helpful, making a doctor's appointment for me also when I needed a prescription for some medication I had run out of. All members of staff are very welcoming. The owners are a lovely couple who have a quiet and supportive presence at the hotel during the daytime. The rooms are SPOTLESSLY CLEAN - attended to every day by friendly staff - and the beds are very comfortable; we slept very well. The bathrooms are also SPOTLESS and comfortable in size.The hotel is located in a clean and quiet family area of Paris with wide footpaths and all of the amenities you need within very easy strolling distance including eateries, post office, supermarkets, pharmacies, doctor, metro stations, bus stations, patisseries and the cleanest laundromat we visited overseas which has a central payment machine so you don't need to worry about having change.We ate most nights and every morning at Cafe Marco Polo- at the top of the street- because their food is delicious, reasonably priced and the staff there are delightful. Weused Metro Nation (Picpus is a little closer but Nation is a big interchange which means that more metro lines go through it) and it takes just 20 minutes to get into central Paris. It's very convenient.For me, this hotel is perfect, as is the local area and I HIGHLY recommend it. A big thank you to everyone at Hotel du Printemps.\n",

I stayed at the hotel nearly a week and the wifi was broken the entire time.My room was small and although it included a toilet and shower, it did not include an actual bathroom. The toilet was separated from the bed by a glass partition. The room also lacked a coffee machine.Breakfast is not included and costs an additional 9 Euros. It seems pricey considering breakfast consisted of bread, pastries, spreads, yogurt and boiled egg.The hotel is far from the major attractions. So one is forced to take the metro or drive to visit the attractions. I have stayed in Paris many times and there are better choices than this.\n",

Of course clean rooms (specific hotel giving much attention in the word clean and rooms are indeed VERY clean), to have central metro station that all lines are passing (Nation) close by in order to make our life easier, to offer a coffee (free) in the morning and the most important…. we didn’t want to pay much money for accommodation as we would leave from the hotel early morning and return late evening in order to enjoy the sightseer of Paris thus no reason to pay any expensive hotel.We arrange the booking without breakfast as there are many options close by. There is a bakery in the corner and also a café plus a small mini market that sell also fruits. Rooms were also normal size (for two adults and one child) with modern minimal decoration. People working in the reception were very friendly and always ready to answer any of our questions.For sure this is a good 3 stars hotel and not a 2 stars hotel.\n",

There are many restaurants within walking distance, post office around the corner, several bakeries and grocers. The local farmers market is open on Saturday and Wednesday mornings, just down the block. The Hotel is small, rooms are small but comfortable, everything is clean, and the decor is calming. The hotel offers breakfast for €10/day per person, but we didn't partake. Coffee is available, and it's good. The front desk staff is very helpful. Zdravko works evenings, and is always will to hear about your day. Wafa and Loretta are on day shift and can help with all things Paris. They all speak English.

I booked this hotel, as even though someone had commented that the rooms were small but this was normal for Paris, I hadn't really anticipated the room to be quite this small. We had a double bed but with very little room to swing a cat on either side. Location was good- easy to navigate the metro and had plenty of places to explore.The room itself only had one neighbour and was in a small courtyard - which was nice as my other half could nip outside to have a puff on his e-cig. It was also relatively soundproofed however you did have the rumble of the metro trains running regularly throughout the day and most of the night. Breakfast was extra and was a standard buffet breakfast but the staff were very friendly and helpful.So room size, average breakfast and the rumble of the metro keeps this review as a three. The staff and the location however was good.\n",

      "  review_body : My sister and I stayed here for 11 nights in late September and were absolutely delighted with our choice.We are from Australia and were a little concerned about making our way from Charles de Gaulle Airport to the hotel near Nation. An email sent to the hotel before we left home requesting help to secure transport was very quickly responded to and transport booked for us! It made the end of our long journey very relaxing.Our twin room overlooked a beautiful tree-lined street in a very quiet area of Paris. Our beds were very comfortable and the white cotton bed linen soothing on tired muscles. Both the bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean. We were able to hang some clothes in the wardrobe and we could safely leave our valuables in the locked safe in our wardrobe. The elevator was a godsend at the end of each day (we were on the third floor) and our room was serviced each day while were exploring beautiful Paris.Each member of staff was professional, helpful and patient (with our poor attempts at speaking French) but all can speak English well. They offered to book a car for us to take us to Gare de Nord to catch the Eurostar as they advised us that it is not a particularly safe area, especially at night. We were very thankful for their help and efficiency.There are plenty of amenities nearby including some excellent restaurants, drycleaners, a Laundromat (a pleasant 11 minute walk away and we saw more of the local area), at least two supermarkets, fresh food market, boulangeries, pharmacies Picpus Metro and Nation Metro very close by (and the number one line which runs under the Louvre, Concorde, Champs Elysee, Arc de Triomphe, runs via Nation). Although not in central Paris, it was very easy and quick to travel anywhere on the Metro and we really loved that the locality was quiet and we felt safe when walking in the evenings to and from dinner.We made some lovely acquaintances at the local café where we had breakfast each morning.The décor of the hotel is very appealing and the foyer area was both cosy and welcoming. I would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel du Printemps and I will be staying there again for 14 nights in 2017.\n",

      "  review_body : My sister and I stayed here for our first trip to Paris. The rooms are small, but very nice and have all the basic amenities. They're clean and housekeeping comes every day. I liked the beds, though my sister thought they were too firm. They have a nice little closet with six wooden hangers and a small safe. They offer a large and a small towel for each person (which anyone with long hair will appreciate). I will say that the shower was quite small and made shaving my legs a little annoying. But the bathroom has a blowdryer that worked well. They also give you soap, a shower cap and a \"vanity set\" with a little nail file, q-tips and cotton pads too. There is a thermostat in the room, and it was nice to be able to control the temperature. The staff was nice. The weekend desk clerk (who was so sweet and friendly!) helped us find a last minute shuttle to Orly airport so we didn't have to navigate public transit (it would've been a much longer trip to the airport if we took trains and buses). That said, everywhere else was easy to get to from the hotel, though you're definitely taking the subway to get to all the tourist attractions. It's near a metro stop, and the subway system is fairly easy to figure out. The breakfast they offer is fairly basic. It's just croissants, baguettes, cereal and you can hard boil eggs. There's a machine for cappuccinos and other drinks as well. Honestly, I'd recommend it only if it's included in your package. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it, but it's convenient if you just want something quick before heading out. Only thing that's weird (and this was my first trip to France, so maybe this is normal there?) is that they make you give the front desk your key every time you leave. There is someone at the desk 24 hours, so there is always someone to give your key back, no matter what time you come home. One less thing to worry about losing while you're out and about, so it's fine.\n",

      "  review_body : A group of 11 of us stayed at the Hotel du Printemps for ten days in June of 2016. We found the hotel immaculate and the staff friendly and willing to help us find our way about Paris. At night the front door of the hotel is locked but there is a desk clerk on duty 24 hours a day and has a buzzer to open the door after hours--an added level of safety in an already safe neighborhood. The staff arranged shuttles to and from the airport for us and called tour companies and arranged tours for us. They willingly looked up addresses and coordinated addresses with metro stops and supplied us with maps and even printouts!The residential neighborhood is quiet and yet full of eateries--we never ate twice at the same place. With two metro stops in the immediate area, greater Paris is easily accessible and my nephew appreciated and used the nearby Velib bicycle stand to go into central Paris. Be forewarned--the rooms are very small, but we didn't intend to spend much time in our rooms anyway--we spent quite a bit of time in the enclosed patio off the back of the hotel and in the lounge in the reception area. All worked well for us, but might be a bit of a challenge with small children. The hotel answered my emails promptly and efficiently and even called me a couple of times free of charge. (I live in the USA.) Emails always contained individual names--that was also very helpful as I knew individuals to whom I could address further correspondence or with whom I could pursue individual topics. I could adjust the temperature in my room and to me, that is a big plus. I would definitely stay at the Hotel du Printemps again and will be recommending it to my friends who might be visiting Paris. All in all we had a great experience with the Hotel du Printemps and the neighborhood.\n",

      "  review_body : This was our second time staying at the Hotel Du Printemps - we stayed here originally in 2013 and were so impressed with this little gem that we decided to come back. This time we requested the accessible room as my girlfriend uses a wheelchair and I have to say it's one of the best disabled access rooms we have stayed in. The bathroom was huge with all the adaptions expected and a modern wet room style shower. All the rooms are really nicely decorated with cute shabby chic style furniture, which really adds to the character and charm of the place. Surprisingly the accessible room was actually quite big, unlike the regular rooms that are on the smaller side (this is to be expected for boutique hotels in Paris). Like the first time around, the cleaning service was spot on, with not a spec of dirt left in the bathroom or elsewhere. The hotel is situated off a quiet residential street, just around the corner from a number of restaurants, patisseries and Nation metro station, that can get you to all the tourist areas of Paris within 5-10 mins. The reception staff were really friendly and welcoming and were on hand 24 hours a day to get you teas, coffees and alcoholic drinks - all quite reasonably priced too. Again, another very pleasant stay at the Hotel du Printemps; will likely stay here again on any future visits to Paris. \n",

Not sure if this is the norm for that part of the city or if it was just this particular hotel. We were on the 10th floor and had a partial view of the Eiffel Tower which was lovely and it was just a quick walk to get to the tower as well. The breakfast buffet was 15 euro per person which seemed a bit much to me considering the selection.

      "  review_body : I booked the hotel in advance back in February for my 50th birthday. We could not get into the room until 2, so we ended up sitting in the lobby for 3 hours. When we finally got into the room, I was so surprised by the great things they did for me to celebrate, it was very much appreciated.You can't beat the location, it is steps from the Eiffel Tower, and 2 train stations.However, there were a few things we were not happy with. The coffee, cups, sugar and milk were not refilled daily, so my mother had to keep asking housekeepers for refills. We tried calling several times but apparently the phone lines were down for 2 days, which I have never seen in a hotel. The spare pillow was in a plastic case with a broken zip - it was literally sitting on the shelf next to the bag - so we had to open it from the side to get the pillow out. The hairdryer cut out after 2 minutes and would not come back on until it cooled down. And, the bed had a heavy quilt, and the air conditioning did not seem to be working, so I ended up hot and sweating every night. There was no top sheet, so most nights I ended up kicking the quilt off and sleeping with the blanket I got on our flight instead. The staff were great, the rooms were nice and clean, and overall our stay was good, but some things need to be worked on. We looked forward to this trip for 18 months, so it was disappointing that some things did not go right.\n",

      "  review_body : Me and my friend enjoyed our staying at the unique hotel Mercure in Paris, only a few meters away from Europe's most visited monument, the Eiffel Tower, and just a few steps from the metro station of ''Bir-Hakeim''! Apart from its special location, what we appreciated most was the sense of the warm hospitality, the clean rooms, the facilities (free wi-fi with fast internet speed, very qualitative shampoos & bath foams) and certainly the personnel's excellent professionalism. I also fell in love with the unique decoration of the room (Eiffel Tower style), which was very impressive and fit so well with the Hotel's general atmosphere. I would also like to underline the wide variety of the products at the Hotel's breakfast and their remarkable quality. It goes without saying that the Mercure Hotel is going to be my choice again at my future trip to Paris and i totally recommend it especially to those who love the monument of the Eiffel Tower!\n",

However a 4-star hotel usually had a very good service. In this Mercure Paris centre Eiffel Tower, the reception staff is unqualified/incompetent. They don't want you to pay in advance for the breakfasts, they bring you broken iron in your room (please see the photos), they are not friendly at all but talk to you like a friend, they don't know how to link your hotel booking to your Accord loyalty card... By the way, I had a power cut when I was in my bedroom, I went down to the reception straight away, no excuse at all from the staff. All in all, the hotel is very well located, but has an awful service at the reception desk.I do not recommend it. I would have preferred an independent hotel.\n",

Reception never picked up our phone, we came down three times to reception to request bathroom accessories and they assured us those will be there immediately.

Can’t find anything positive to say about this hotel and this is our second stay here, should have known from the first time and the staffs rudeness. We had so much trouble getting checked into the hotel as they wanted our travel agency’s credit card details, to which we kindly explained that everything has been paid and processed in full and that the card does not belong to us and we have no right to share this information with them. When we said to them that they would need to contact the travel agency, they refused and told us that we were the ones that needed to contact the agency. Upon consulting with our travel agent we found out that she had been in contact prior (March 2019) and was assured there would be no issues. No apology was given to us for the hassle they put us through during check in and would always say “it is our policy”, pretty sure we heard that about 10 times out of our 5 days stay. We also had to move rooms due to a water leak in the bathroom and even that was trouble, “it’s just water from when you had a bath”, in the end they changed our room because it was in fact a water leak. Nothing special about the facilities and rooms outdated. All I can say is never again!\n",

Few minutes walk to the Eiffel tower and surrounds. The hotel itself is rather old, the room was spacious enough for two. However the housekeeping each day seem to miss the mark. Second day no towels were provided and the second hotel key card that was in the holder for electricity was gone. When asked about it, instead of investigating it, we were given a second card. It didn't look like the floor was vacuumed as we found dirt on the floor. Next time the tea bag and milk was not topped up, then the serviettes were not replaced. The last two nights, the tips we left were still there. There was also one time they entered the room without asking while we were inside. They realised it was the wrong room and apologised. So I dont know whats going on with the housekeeping. The free Wifi was not strong either, kept dropping out infrequently. Overall, good location but these points need to be looked at. \n",

On entering separate bathroom/toilet bathroom very nice then mini fridge and over to the bed as you open the curtains I was in awe the Eiffel Tower is right there. This is an amazing view, hubby asked for room facing It. If you stare closely you can actually see people on it so close. The room isn’t overly large but we found it very comfortable, and once you see the view it’s perfect. This room came with a mini bar/fridge that they would refill each day with a couple of drinks included only problem was each day we came back to room which was perfectly cleaned we always had to call to ask for the refills nearly every day there.

      "  review_body : We decided we wanted to stay close to the Eiffel Tower because it was something we would want to visit a few times and see during the day and the night time. This hotel was perfect. They worked hard to get us into our room because our flight landed very early. They stored our luggage until the room was ready so we could explore and get some breakfast. We booked 2 rooms for our family and they were next to each other on the 9th floor. We had a gorgeous view of the top of the Eiffel Tower and could watch it light up and twinkle every night from our bed. We also sat on the outside steps and could see almost the whole tower. It was just a few minutes walk to the tower.A short walk from the hotel you will find cafes, shops, a bakery, grocery store and more. It's also an easy place to pick up a taxi. The rooms were very clean and comfortable (but very small compared to US hotels). We had a double bed with a chair, 2 side tables, and a cabinet with a safe and fridge. There is also a closet. The main bathroom was a good size to get ready and shower. The darkening curtains were great and it was very quiet in our rooms. If you are in a privilege room (8th floor and up) they will restock your room every day with Coke, Diet Coke, water, orange juice, and sparkling water. We used the Batobus to get around the city and the pick-up place was just across the street from the Eiffel tower so it was an easy walk to get to it. You can also walk to the Trocadero and the Arc de Triumph. It's a long walk - but you can also walk to the Louvre. The only issue we had is that the metro stops were closed that were close to the hotel because they were under construction. But I preferred using the Batobus to get around so you can see more of the city. (If you get the Batobus - do it for 2 days because it's like $2 more!) The staff was very helpful and friendly. Take a taxi (with an illuminated taxi sign) to and from the airport - it will be a lot cheaper! And don't forget an electricity converter and a power strip to charge all your stuff! and a wash cloth.\n",

Room was larger than expected, my daughter and I had split beds which were comfortable and there was Plenty of room to move around with our luggage and such. Little stingy on towels and only toiletries are a small bar of soap and a push body hair gel dispenser in the shower, but for the price and location this was no big deal. room was clean /tidy, only a little worn. The bathroom had a tub/shower and sink and the toilet is in another small compartment which was nice because if one person was bathing the other could still privately use the toilet. Staff was pleasant but not overly helpful. Just more efficient like I’m checking you in or out and that’s my job. Location of hotel is best!!!! The Eiffel Tower is right there!! Plus you can walk to the river get a day pass on the batobus which taxis you to most of the key sights you will want to see. Also there are plenty of great cafes of you head away from the river. I would definitely stay here again for the location! Also if you’re planning on going to Disney Paris - DLP has a shuttle pickup/drop off right in front of this hotel. Check the Disney website for ticket info. \n",

      "  review_body : Stayed with friends at this hotel as we read great reviews about this. Excellent location, reception staff very helpful. Breakfast was excellent with a great selection and variety catering to all.Housekeeping absolute disgrace. Rang first morning for towels three times. At the end I had to ring for the fourth time at 8.30 as we needed to be somewhere at 9.00am and they then brought up the towels. We came back to hotel as we had a tour booked at 4.30pm to find our room still not cleaned so as we were getting ready the cleaner knocked to clean the room. The bar person came in to replenish the bar. It was chaotic and we felt very uncomfortable The next day I needed some milk it took two calls to get some.On our last morning we were leaving early so the night before I had to ring from my mobile as the room phone was not working to get towels. I waited till 11.00pm and still no towels. The next morning I rang the office with my mobile to ask for the towels. The gentleman at reception was very apologetic. Our friends also had issues with housekeeping.Very sad that a great hotel has very very poor housekeeping services. Would I stay there again, NO\n",

      "  review_body : My friends booked this hotel for my hen do to Paris for two nights. On arrival at 3pm we were told that we had no rooms even though check in was 3pm on the reservation. The lady on the front desk was rude to my friend and asked us to wait in the waiting area while they worked on the “problem”. They wouldn’t tell us what the problem was, so we were worried we would be stranded in Paris with no rooms there was no confirmation they had our rooms for an hour or so while we waited. Then after three trips to the desk, seeing 4 lots of people get checked in before us, and no communication we got three rooms all on different floors, but we were just happy we had rooms. The lady asked to take €200 from my friend as room deposit my friend said no, this was not on the agreement and we had already paid in full for the rooms. She agreed and that was that.We have just got home and my friend has looked at her bank statement and they have taken the €200 anyway even though my friend strongly said no! Very dishonest of them! And we are writing a separate email to them. But just be aware if you are staying there!Some of the staff tried to help us after that but when we asked to order a taxi on the first night for the next morning to Disneyland Paris the lady the next morning (she’s always on in the day and is the most unhelpful lady to deal with) said it wasn’t booked and nothing she could do about it so this made us delayed. My mum on the last day couldn’t open her safe and made a trip to the reservation desk to ask for help, the same lady as before was there said she had called someone and they will be with her in 10 mins. Half an hour came and went and no one was with my mum to help so my mum called and finally a janitor arrived to help. It seems that lady never called anyone in he first place! The rooms were fine and clean but the service was just awful and unhelpful which is such a shame as my friends booked this for me as a surprise so they feel extremely let down. I would stay in this area again but not at this hotel ever again! \n",

      "  review_body : Pullman was an average hotel, there was nothing special about staying here. The representatives were not pleasant, when we arrived and left daily, they did not greet us or anyone else for that matter. I’m used to being greeted everytime I enter a hotel but this did not happen here. Also, when we asked the concierge for a taxi, they said “good luck”, “it’s hard getting a taxi around here”. There was no one that went out of our way to help us. However, the room was clean but we had to call down for wash cloths every morning. Overall, I wouldn’t stay here again. The property is steps way from the Eiffel Tower but far from all the other tourist attractions and since the buses and trains were not running, it was impossible to get a taxi, we had to walk. So it was pretty far.\n",

      "  review_body : Unless you primarily want to see the Eiffel Tower, it's just not a great location. (I think Viking Cruises puts people there because it is far from other sites, but sounds like a good location.) The rooms would be fabulous, were the temperatures not sweltering. It's November, so yes, one has to open the windows to the city pollution to get the room to cool off--there is no a/c, or it is shut off for the winter (which normally would make sense.). Of course, for breakfast, you might consider wearing shorts and t-shirt, because you can count on it being hot like Arizona in the summer--a common occurrence in many hotels and shops in Europe. Other than the room being overly hot--which is generally not considered good sleeping conditions--it's a nice room, as one would expect.\n",

      "  review_body : On my first trip to Europe from the USA, I realize how different customs, cultures and food can be. While visiting Ireland, I discovered the meat there is only ‘well done’ (medium rare? Whats that?). So now I am in Paris and my first food experience was breakfast at the Pullman Tour Eiffel. I must say it was definitely a positive experience. Security was evident in the lobby as well as at the restaurant door. Inside I was very well tended to by an awesome team of women -Celine, Chiara, and Ndeye. They were polite and attentive which made me feel valued as a customer. The food- definitely a step up from Ireland. This may sound silly but it really does make a difference in your day whether you start with a full belly or not, and the food was well prepared so starting with a full belly it is! Overall a very pleasant experience. \n",

      "  review_body : Because we like to take advantage of the \"pre tours\" on arranged trips (this one was with Viking River Cruises) we have been to a number of the hotels that cater to the large groups. There is a real difference between the good ones and bad ones--and we have been to both. The advantages of getting a hotel at the start of any trip are so significant that we have learned to \"put up\" with some inconveniences in order to get the benefits--a place to recover from the international flight (get adjusted to the new time zone), a complete briefing on the trip(s) we will be taking, assurances that getting to the ship is arranged and the porters pick up the bags, a decent meal after the airplane food, a chance to spend more time in a big city (most tours do start in major cities) that we may or may not have been ito previously, and the comfort of knowing that we are not \"cutting it close\" by arriving on the same day to catch a ship. That last point is critical because we have been on thrips where there have been guests that \"missed the boat!\"With the Pullman, we found a hotel that was IMMEDIATELY prepared to get us to our room at 10:00 AM and allow us to get rested and cleaned up for the remainder of the day. This is such a simple thing, but many of these hotels simply can't find a way to \"flip\" the rooms after the previous guests have left. Going out to see the town without changing clothes and getting a shower after the flight is simply not an enjoyable experience. They also made the check in process painless and fast because they already had our data on file from Viking.The rooms were well cleaned and very spacious. The view of the Eiffel Tower from the room was an extra benefit! The room had some \"American\" electric outlets for our phones and computer--another nice touch! Even better, the internet service worked the instant we walked into the room and our bags were there 2 minutes later.  We also really like having the robes in the room. Finally having space to put your suitcase out for use vs. having to hang you trip clothes (and then having to re-pack) is really a plus! They had bottled water, tea and coffee available in the room for no extra charge. Having a room service option that serves good food is a gigantic plus! Room service gives you an extra bit of time vs. looking for a restaurant to meet your food needs--which are based on your home time zone. Finally, and perhaps most important, the bed was comfortable and there were pillow (two different sizes) options in addition to feathers.The hotel had an excellent room for our tour briefing and had our tour instructions available for us upon check in. They made clear the times to get our bags out for the porters, the bus pickup points and times for the breakfast buffet (hot and cold)--which was excellent and had many options for almost all travelers from different countries.At checkout, we had nothing to do except pass our credit cards for the \"extras\" and not stand in line! Many in our group did not have any extras and that made the process very fast and easy. The staff is bilingual and it is easy to communicate with them.The hotel is attractive and well maintained. The parking area in front is a little crowded for the bus, but they seemed to manage, The lobby is adequate for all the baggage and the elevators are fast & quiet. All in all, they score highly on the checklist we have for these hotels. I wish all the others were as good. In fact, if there were a category for the \"tour hotels,\" this would be a 5, but compared to all the luxury hotels in the world, this is a solid 4.\n",

      "  review_body : Initially we booked this hotel months in advance and it was paid for before we arrived. The day we arrived at the hotel, which was about noon, we were advised that check in was at 2 pm but they needed to add our credit card for incidentals and also had them “block” a room for us while they held our baggage. After we roamed the city for a couple of hours until our room would be ready, we returned and were told they did not have a room for us but they could give us a room on the second floor with 2 twin beds. We originally paid for a Superior room with an Eiffel Tower view, so needless to say we were extremely upset and frustrated at how the front desk was handling this situation. There were also others in our party and some in the lobby with the same complaints. The front desk manager offered to have us sleep in the presidential suite for just one night until they could give us a room the following day. Although we had a place to sleep, we could not unpack and get settled so this was actually not a very good solution. The next day we were placed in a room on the 7th floor with the view we requested. That very night as we were getting dressed to leave for dinner an employee opened our door and startled me. I asked her how she had the key to enter our room and she responded that she was the manager on duty and thought the room was vacant. I responded “how is it possible that you are unaware that this room is occupied”. She apologized but it was obvious that this hotel is poorly run and they have no clue on how to treat guests that are staying at their establishment. The bathroom faucet was also broken and splashed water everywhere when you turned it on. Upon checking out, they also tried to charge us for the incidentals in lieu of deducting it from the charge that was made upon checking in. My advice to anyone wanting to visit París...do not stay at the Pullman. You will see many pictures on social media but to be honest the treatment we received from the staff was subpar. If I could do it all again, I would have stayed anywhere else. The city offers many beautiful sites and there are hotels next to those very sites that are spectacular. We were a group of 4 families and reserved 1 standard room, 2 superior, 1 junior Suite and 1 Suite, and all had a bad experience with this hotel. Do your research and choose wisely. The Champs-Elysees area would be a better option!\n",

On arrival we were greeted and shown to the check in desk where we were served by Vivek, who spoke good English and made good conversation with us whilst explaining the facilities. A deposit was taken for the room which if €50 per adult per night. I had a travel card for the trip and requested it be charged to this rather than the card I booked on and this was done without a problem. We were there celebrating both our birthdays which they gave us a voucher for complimentary cocktails in the bar. We were in room 414, balcony with Eiffel Tower view which was just amazing! I had read the higher rooms had the better view but even on the 4th floor we weren’t disappointed. We had twin beds that were very comfy, a chest of three drawers and slim wardrobe - sufficient for a short stay. There were the facilities of an iron and ironing board (stored in the wardrobe) and a full size hairdryer. Tea & coffee facilities and two bottles of complimentary water which were replaced each day. An Ice machine was located on each ‘odd’ numbered floor. Tv had a some English channels, was nice to be able to watch a bit of ITV.We had pre-paid for breakfast which had lots of choice for all the various nationalities in the hotel and us brits could still get our English breakfast - even the sausages & bacon were good! We did have breakfast ordered to our room one morning which was a €5 pp supplement but very worth it. We were able to order anything off the menu and arrived within the 15 min time slot requested. The food sent was plentiful and kept hot as under the table is food warmer cupboard.We also used room service for dinner twice as found the room service menu a better choice than the restaurant (also better for a 15 yr old). Contacting room service was very easy - they always picked up 1st time and the food was sent up to the room within 30 mins. I had also pre-paid for a bottle of wine on my booking which is worth doing having paid only €20 compared to €35. Checkout again was smooth and asked if I wanted to pay for the extras against the deposit made or could pay then and the deposit would be released. All in all we enjoyed our stay at the hotel and found the staff catered politely and friendly to our needs.Definitely recommend paying that extra for the tower view room, I could have sat on the balcony watching it all day! \n",

      "  review_body : We stayed in the Eiffel suite, on the top floor for one night. The views are truly stunning and the balcony runs the entire length of the large room. Everything was as it should be, an amazing experience. Despite proposing to my now fiance, I think the highlight was when we found out the very well stocked mini bar was complimentary lol. It is very expensive at nearly £1,000 a night but the room is worth it, just once for the experience. However there is NO SERVICE so dont expect it.I felt sorry for the staff, I saw many people in the lobby [usually loud Americans] screaming about getting a free upgrade. It seems that everyone tries it and the staff looked visibly frazzled explaining the hotel was fully booked. Check in is a terribly stressful experience, cant even imagine how the poor staff deal with this every day.We phoned for a cork screw twice but it never arrived. There came a point when we just gave up on any service. We asked to have breakfast out on the terrace at the front of the hotel restaurant and was told no so in the end we just left the hotel and their staff alone and enjoyed dinner elsewhere in Paris.WARNING:At check in I was told they wanted a 500 euro deposit for expenses, we didnt intend to expense anything to the room but couldnt work out if this deposit was optional. I was promised the funds would be released back to my card at checkout.However, its 3 days and two emails later [with no reply] and the money still hasnt returned to my account. I am desperately hoping this is an oversight but becoming increasingly concerned that we wont get our money back having left the country now.I work in the finance industry and I know that the funds are usually ring fenced, upon check out they simply release it. So im beginning to think they actually charged the whole amount and it will be weeks of chasing them for an international payment back to me. Not at all happy about this and the lack of transparency surrounding this kind of activity.\n",

      "  review_body : First: we did pay extra, ahead of time, for a balcony room with a view (sideways, but fine) of the Tour Eiffel. We would recommend a balcony room just for the private outside space and for more complete airing out/cooling of the room.Generally: very modern style. Excellent free breakfast, great for big breakfast eaters. Nice enough bar and restaurant. Good concern for the enviro, complete with their own gardens and chickens!Bedroom: We had a room with two singles as we are both 'active sleepers.' A large room with nice if overly firm beds, but NO drawers or shelves. We put most of our clothes on the hangers available and then just stacked things either on the floor of the closet or on the top shelf. Good lighting throughout.Bathroom: The lighting was bright but so oddly angled that no one under 6 feet would really be able to take a good look at their own face in the mirror - maybe a blessing? :-) The bath/shower was a bit odd: very, very high edging to climb over to get in - certainly not suitable for anyone with real mobility issues. As is often true of European hotel bath/showers, the shower 'guard' means water gets all over everything. If this sort of thing bothers you, either ask about better access baths or find another place. It DID have a very odd odor. I don't think , as others have suggested, it was sewage; I think it was some kind of cleaner?Staff: very mixed. Front desk people were nice enough, but not very good English speakers (and I am fairly fluent in French). The younger concierge's English is terrible; he also does not seem to be the brightest tack in the pack. The doormen/porters and cleaning staff were more helpful than the more 'prestige' staff.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at this hotel as part of a Viking Cruise at the end of a river cruise for two nights. The hotel is totally lacking in amenities. There were no drawers or shelves in the closet to put our clothes. The bathtub was so high to get into that it was a health hazard. I am not handicapped nor overweight, just 5'3\" and was afraid of falling! The personnel was unhelpful and it was a disappointment that even front desk receptionists could barely speak English. I am not an ugly American. I speak English, Spanish, and some French and realize I am in a foreign country, but this is a large hotel catering to Americans and could do better in their language skills. It seems Viking makes hotel choices based on the lowest cost to them. For the following three nights we changed to the Hotel Splendid Etoile which we had booked independent and had a marvelous stay.\n",

Even thought they came to drop some chemical substance in the drain, the smell persisted to the extent that my clothes smell too. One of my colleagues was awaken during the night due to the smell. I personally slept with the window opened which obviously made the room very noisy so i could not sleep.

      "  review_body : This hotel treated us so well! My wife & I stayed for a week while visiting Paris. We booked a King suite with Superior view. Our room was on the 11th floor (room 1133) upon entering my jaw literally dropped! Stunning view of the tower in the day, even better at night as it lights up & shows off. It glitters every hour on the hour. Scenic romantic backdrop for sure. You can definitely create Instagram worthy photos (if you’re into that type of thing!). The room has a desk & chair if you need to get some work done. The shower was beautiful & worked well. Bed soft & room clean. The staff came daily & was very friendly. Everyone we encountered was bilingual which relieved the stress we had about going abroad. There is a fantastic restaurant attached to it with master chefs creating dishes. Don’t worry if you don’t have a converter their are American outlets. One by the night stands and one at the office area. My only critique is there’s not one in the bathroom, but I just placed the small mirror I had with me on the shelf near desk, so I could flat iron my hair. I’m going to place a photo in my review so you can see what the plug looks like, Bc it may seem tricky, but just i promise it works. If you like fresh air, or really want to experience the view, the window in the room actually opens. Wouldn’t recommend doing so if you have children with you, for obvious reasons! \n",

Apart from the grand view of the Eiffel from the hotel lobby and a minute’s walk up to the tower there is not much to talk about. Our room overlooked the garden apparently (which din’t seem like one). After requesting for an eiffel tower view on booking we were not given one. And this trip was special to us as we were celebrating our bdays. The breakfast spread was less than average and the omelettes served were burnt for the most part and the orders taken were always wrong. The room service was not great either and all in all I would not highly recommend staying here. If it’s just for the Eiffel then there are other great hotels you can book and take a walk up to the tower.No WOW factor whatsoever!\n",

I turned up expecting to be able to sit out on the balcony with a full view of the Tower like many of the pictures on the website show. Instead, I get just the tip! In saying that, I would suggest staying somewhere in the vicinity for much cheaper as we found the Tower was much easier to just walk to and see up close.

      "  review_body : Pullman Paris Tour Eiffe - Disappoints! My wife and children traveled from Australia in October booking two rooms, room 636 & 637 with four guests in total at the Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel and this has to be the worst stay in a hotel she has ever stayed in. Customer service at the hotel from the time we arrived is of a 0 star. I’ve traveled to many hotels in my own country and around the world and this has to be the worst service and hotel standard from all areas that she has experienced. A small but important service is to provide complimentary water in rooms; there was one complimentary water bottle per room?! We booked two rooms with 4 guests. That’s fine, called the front desk to ask if would could please have an extra two on arrival for the kids and it took them over 2hours to bring them up and many calls so that definitely wasn’t a great start.I would only give this hotel a 0 star and even if I was to be given a free room I wouldn’t take the offer due to the horrible experience and service. Calling front desk to no answer for the four nights we stayed this was on a regular basis. Then calling again and again, over 5 times to which there is still no answer. Called room service to get someone on the line. Finally, service desk answered to ask for towels and water which we also had to wait 2hours+ for, with many calls too after that.The hotel service is very disappointing. The Pullman should be very disappointed and I will definitely be sharing my experience on all social media platforms because it’s terrible and a waste of people’s money to stay at a hotel that service on all fronts isn’t to a high standard that the Pullman advertise and sell their brand to be. Checking out, called front desk to ask for the baggage service as we had 4 large suitcases and 4 hand luggage to find out there isn’t one available. It was 6:30am?!\n",

I went to the room. Instead of a double bed as I requested there were two singles. I ordered room service and was told it takes 20 mins - in reality it took 1 hour so I ate very late. The safe broke down and my passport was stuck inside. They took 30 minutes to send someone when i rang. I asked for my room to be cleaned and they left the food tray in my room. I rang to ask them to remove after a whole day and they promised to send someone but nobody came. My room smelt bad as a result. WORST of all I was staying for business and in the morning I asjed the nan who flags taxis for the hotel to help me. He refused and claimed he was busy with others. When there was hardly anyone. I went back to ask again after 5 mins and he was rude and aggressive with me and refused to help. He told me there are no taxis in the area and i should take metro!! I was now delayed for work by another 15 mins because of his incompetence and had to complain to reception that he wasnt helping me. A lady from reception came out instead and stopped a taxi for me. I was later informed he didn't help me because I didn't give him money (aka a bribe) to help me stop a taxi!!!This is beyond disgusting for a 4 star hotel in Paris. I am not bribing someone to do their job. His name was \"baba\". Service in the FRAME restaurant was extremely slow. We were ignored because of a VIP table. It took 30 mins for a bill to be produced. We were expressly told the delay is because they have a vip table of 4 important people. The quality of the food was awful. Never order the apple crumble, cheesecake, frites or noodle dish. It was way overpriced. All in all my business trip was made 100 times more stressful because of the bad attitude of the staff. I am highly disappointed.

We could not reach the front desk by phone after trying numerous times. I had to dress out of my pajamas and go downstairs to reach someone. When I got down to the main desk, two lazy attendants were gossiping between one another. When I asked why no one picked up, they said they never heard the phone ring. Breakfast was good, although the hotel does NOT have enough staff when cruise companies are in the hotel. View of the Tour Eiffel is likely one of the best in Paris. But there is more to Paris than the Tour Eiffel. Again, an adequate hotel for one night while waiting to board a river cruise ship, but not much more. There is NO seating in the hotel lobby, discouraging lounging by tired tourist occupants, and reinforcing the cruise hotel mentality of moving people in and out.\n",

      "  review_body : Viking Cruise selected this hotel to begin our European river cruise. The staff was capable, but there were too few staff members and the lines were very long. Breakfast service was a bright spot--good food and friendly staff. I was surprised the desk was not willing to have small Euro bills and coins on hand to facilitate sightseeing. The most disappointing thing to happen is that some of my wife's jewelry was stolen from our room. Another member of the cruise party reported to us that some money was stolen from her purse in the room. There is a safe in the room, so if you stay at this hotel, be sure to put everything of value in it even if you are only leaving a short time.\n",

Staff were not helpful and not polite at all even so staff at the entrance. We went there which was on occasion that polite was blocking the road and only one way to go the hotel but either polite in Paris not helpful and we rung reception asking for another solutions or give us different direction which was awful couldn’t helpful. We had to sit and even beg for police to let’s part not only that we were exhausted from journey and traffic was overwhelming but we still sit in the ca and try to talked to the polite can’t even speak English. It was really hard to understood each other. Until they got a call off we can get through the road which only this one direct to hotel. - Breakfast was dreadful especially omelet section the chief should know better and separate the area for guests waiting to order and put close together bad management I never seen.Pro:Location, View which was stunning room with balcony.\n",

Location is great and staff tries, but they got easily overhwhelmed with all of the tour unloading at the same time. To make it worse, one of the elevators was down and so you waited for long periods to get up or down. Fortunately we were on the 2nd floor and able to walk the stairs, but some of our tour members were older and this was an issue both checking in and checking out. The breakfast was included and was nice, sort of a cafeteria setting.\n",

      "  review_body : We picked this hotel for our short stay in Paris since it is located steps away from the Eiffel Tower. It made for a magical first night in the city since we could walk around the area while the tower was illuminated. Days later, however, we grew a bit tired of the tourists here, the restaurants that cater to them, and the necessary travel to the other parts of the city (even if the hotel is located within walking distance to the hop on-hop off bus stop and the metro).We had no complaints about the hotel itself. Our room was clean and comfortable and rather large for a European hotel. Wifi and breakfast were complimentary. The breakfast buffet included a large assortment of hot and cold options, including made-to-order eggs. Service was great, with the exception of the hotel bar where it was missing altogether. I would highly recommend this hotel if in Paris for a short stay. We'll likely stay in another area of the city next time to get a better feel for the place.\n",

The taxi service outside hotel was really a problem that was addressed with hotel with no resolution. Restaurant food in evening and bar not good and service awful! Breakfast was good. Bathroom was not cleaned completely. Tub still had scum from morning shower upon return room being cleaned after 5 pm.

      "  review_body : We stayed for one night, en route to the Champagne region, and chose this hotel because it's located at the end of the street in which our son lives. We usually stay in a 4 star hotel in Boulogne when we visit Paris for a few days, but the Ibis Styles was more convenient this time. We loved it; it's modern and vibrant, and the staff are all genuinely friendly and keen to help. The rooms are small, but perfectly fine, and the breakfast - included in the price - is very good. The location is right on the edge of Paris, but in a lively area with good facilities, and it's perfect for sports related trips. It's opposite a small park, and very close to the Porte de Saint Cloud metro station. It's the perfect hotel for short stays: if you plan to stay more than 2 or 3 nights you might be better off staying in a more expensive hotel with larger rooms. But the \"free\" breakfast makes a real difference, price-wise. We usually pay at least €12 each in our usual hotel, and for an inferior breakfast, so it's worth factoring that in. We were well impressed.\n",

And the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful! The hotel is a short walking distance to Paris Gare du Nord, Gare St Lazare and the metro stations It is a relatively short ride to main attractions in Paris. The room itself was a bit dated and the bed was small, but this is what I paid for in a solo room. Although small, it was very clean. The in room safe did not work even after changing the battery, which might have been a greater concern of mine if I had stayed longer. There are minimal amenities at this hotel, but I was mainly looking for a place to stay for one afternoon and evening in Paris before transferring on to another location in the morning.

If you want to be insulted and asked about your culture or where you are from and discriminated against, then you should stay at this hotel. The front desk man who goes by an alias is extremely disrespectful, argues with guests, and makes unparalleled remarks about patrons of the hotel. We had a huge argument with this man, who refused to give us his name after the French Police were called because he was making racial slurs and being a inappropriate. Furthermore, his colleague and supervisor decided to side with him until I unveiled a video which reflected the acts that had taken place. This is the most disgusting hotel in France.

      "  review_body : I had spent a lot of time researching hotels to stay in Paris. I eventually chose this hotel because it had some things we were looking for: free breakfast (with a coupon code), an outdoor space, good location, etc. The room was very small, but very clean, and the space wasn't an issue. The bathroom door automatically shut, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but if you were in there doing your hair or getting ready, it is nice to be able to talk to your travel companion (we just propped it open with a stool). When I checked in they asked if we wanted to add breakfast. I told them that I had used the coupon code during my booking to get the free breakfast. They said they didn't see it on my reservation. I told them that part of the reason I booked this hotel was because of the free breakfast, and I clicked on the link through the promotional email they sent me, and made sure the code was entered. However, after all that...they still did not offer me the free breakfast. I just feel like if a hotel has a coupon code, and the guest knows about the code, they should honor the code. They did not, and I wasn't happy about it. Next the outdoor space they had pictured on their website was nonexistent. The woman showed us the folded up chairs, but alas it was not somewhere to actually sit. Another deception. Finally, the hotel is on an extremely noisy street! It is the main thoroughfare to the Moulin Rouge area it seemed, and every motorcycle in Paris has to drive down the one-way street at all hours of the night as loudly as possible. So if you do not like the sound of a motorcycle brigade at 3am, this might not be the place for you. On the plus side of the hotel, besides the breakfast fiasco, the staff is very nice, friendly, and helpful. The hotel felt rather safe as well. Again, it is very clean and well maintained. But the website description was deceptive.\n",

My room was quiet, clean, comfortable and very spacious. I had a mini fridge so I would have a light breakfast in my room as I just didn’t have the time to take the lovely breakfast in the hotel sadly for me. There is Carrefore supermarche directly opposite for food etc and a larger supermarket 6-8 minutes walk towards the right of the hotel. As I was travelling alone, security and safety were high on my agenda coming back from work and I felt very relaxed eating out by myself - no unwanted attention on all five nights locally. The locals are very respectful & kind. The best bistro that I ate at was the Bergerac Bistro, 3 times in one week - Manuel (the owner/manager?) was so lovely and his kitchen staff create the most smashing food! My steak & potatoes were elevated to the highest stays!! His scallops & curry sauce risotto - sounds weird but so delicious, I’m going to attempt it at home. 5**** even my local French friend was in love with this cosy place. The Saint George on the corner up the left side of the road, was ok but a bit loud for me personally & the food average. \n",

Closest metro station, Sain-Georges, is only a few meters away. Location is also about ten minutes walk from the roissy airport bus stop. The most fabulous part about this establishment is the staff, from the front desk to chambermaids, all were lovely and welcoming. My room was clean and an inviting place to head back to after a full day of shopping/exploring. WiFi worked perfectly fine. Only downside was that the one lift was a bit slow. Unfortunately, I had to change locations after my second night because a friend was coming into town and there were no doubles available for my dates at Albion. Throughout my life, I’ve probably stayed at over two dozen establishments in Paris and Albion ranks up there in terms of quality and price. I’d highly recommend booking with Albion for your next trip to Paris.\n",

It is also located close to a metro station and you can also reach many attractions by foot (if you like walking). The staff is very friendly and helpful. We were perhaps a bit unlucky with our room, it had only a small window overlooking a small atrium. The ventilation was a bit lacking, so the air was stuffy and showers left the whole room humid for a long time. Sound proofing of the drain pipes were also a problem, you could hear your neighbors shower and go to the toilet. There were also clear signs of earlier water damage around the bathroom door.The room was clean at arrival and cleaned every day, so this was no problem.\n",

The staff was less than friendly. One woman at the desk was sometimes rude. I understand this attitude can be normal in France, but shouldn’t be at a hotel that serves tourists. In all, I would’ve given it an average rating, except for the room. Our room was at street level right behind the front desk. It was incredibly noisy and very hot. We had no way to turn down the heat, as the thermostat did not work. The street noise was quite loud. To deal with the heat, we had to open our window, which made the street noise even louder. This also made us worry about someone breaking in, because we were right off the sidewalk with partiers passing all night. On top of that, Front Desk employees would watch TV late into the night which we could hear in our room. I’ve had much worse experiences, but it was a below average stay for me.\n",

Not large but very comfortable with plenty of closet space and nice bathroom. Good A/C. We had a small balcony from which we could see the L'Arc de Triomphe. That put us on the street side but it was quiet at night. Good breakfast. Excellent staff. Very helpful with dinner reservations, taxi, etc. And they truly are open 24 hrs as we found out when we came back very late one night. The location is excellent-- plenty of restaurants and stores nearby. In a quiet neighborhood away from the crowds of Ile de la Cite but only a block from the metro which will take you anywhere quickly and cheaply. Even on a day when the metro was on strike we used Uber with no problems. The price is still an excellent value despite their recent renovation. Thumbs up all around.\n",

This was the first of five hotels we stayed with during a two week vacation in France and Spain, and this was the best breakfast we encountered. Yes, some of the others offered hot items, usually eggs and sausages or the like, cooked some time ago and kept warm in a hotel pan over a Sterno flame. I'll pass on that food safety dice-roll any time in favor of good, fresh fruits and breads, with an attentive, friendly staff keeping items stocked and tables cleared and cleaned.

It is a very short walk from the Metro 2 Charles de Gaulle-Etoile stop being only one street over and down half a block away. It was perfect for our excursions.Our room was on the first floor (2nd floor in the US) and we had a view of the Arc de Triomphe. The afternoon sun shining on the west wall of the Arc was beautiful. Our room was spotless and appointed with coffee (albeit instant with a kettle), extra pillows and full amenities including slippers. For Paris, the room was large and the bathroom was modern with a deep bathtub and shower combo. It felt luxurious and again spotless. We spent 4 nights in the hotel and had no complaints whatsoever.Breakfast was a variety of baked goods, meats, cheeses, cereal, yogurt and fruit. The coffee maker brewed various coffees including espresso, lattes and cappuccinos. Delicious. The dining room was serviced each time a guest finished eating. There is a bar and comfortable lounge area to relax anytime of day. The desk is staffed 24 hours. We loved our stay and this hotel has become our new spot to stay when visiting Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : I took my 13 year old granddaughter to Paris during her spring break. After researching on TripAdvisor for a hotel, I chose Hotel Cecilia because of the positive reviews. We were not disappointed . The location is 2 streets from the Arc deTriomphe and Champs E’lysees and is also conveniently close to the metro and bus. This boutique hotel was charming and old world French. The room and bathroom were new and immaculate. We had a beautiful view from our balcony of the Arc.Breakfast was plentiful and had a typical Europeanselection. All services were excellent with Lucy being particularly helpful planning each day’s excursion.The price was fair for such a great location.Samir was helpful with our plans as I emailed with him before our trip.A special note about a ”find” during our stay. Around the corner on Avenue Carnot is a small restaurant L’Arc Food. It has a few tables and a LARGE menu of sandwiches, burgers, salads, pizza, crepes... and much more. Food is excellent and there is a young staff who opened this restaurant 2 years ago. Try it - you’ll love it!\n",

The breakfast is self service continental style. I took my own almond butter and almond milk because there wasn’t an option for vegan. The room service menu also has no vegan options.However you’re in Paris there are literally millions of places to eat!

And in AMERICA, if you stay at a hotel and put the Do Not Disturb sign up, that usually is a hint to housekeeping that we don't want you coming into our room. So I left some of my items out thinking they would be safe. WRONG!!! I had wrapped my retainers up and put them NEXT TO my contact lens case. When I came home from a long day out, I came to find the room had been cleaned and my retainers TOSSED! I confronted management about it and all they did was send me to a DEAD END of a company who takes care of their liability insurance. This BS company said that they would not consider MY LOSS as ANY LIABILITY AT ALL. It's not my fault some dumb employee didn't KNOW ANY BETTER and thought my retainers were TRASH! They were next to something that wasn't TRASH and YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WORST PLACE EVER. WORST SERVICE EVER. They are ABSOLUTELY REFUSING to pay ANY AMOUNT OR OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKE. They were NOT supposed to COME IN IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN THE SIGN SAID DO NOT DISTURB. Now, I have to pay close to $1000 OUT OF POCKET to get a new set of retainers. Moral of the Story: DON'T STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR STUFF THROWN AWAY AND NOT HAVE ANY RESTITUTION WHATSOEVER.\n",

The entire street and all transportation was being shut down the next day for Armistice Day. We were informed of this after check in. When we asked the front desk person how we could get to the airport for our flight she said she didn't know. She offered no assistance with our situation. I have never had someone in the hospitality be so dismissive. Hours later we emailed the hotel and someone arranged a car hire that we would meet several blocks away. When we returned from dinner we asked the front desk where do we meet this car and what the name of the service was. He said ask in the morning. We were in disbelief that he won't answer such a simple question. In addition to the rude employees the walls were paper thin. We could clearly hear every word of the phone conservation in the room next to us. An email that we sent to the hotel that addressed our problems and concerns to this day has not been answered. We certainly won't be back to this hotel and do not recommend it to others.\n",

To my surprise, the room was ready and I checked in to catch up on sleep after an all night flight. My room was perfect for one person. Comfortable bed, nice flat screen TV, personal balcony, great free WiFi, modern bathroom with walk in shower. Now for the free daily breakfast. OMG, what a great perc! Pastries, cheeses, 4 types of meats, dry cereal, yogurt, juices and a wonderful coffee machine that makes every kind of coffee drink with the push of a button. Beautiful, spacious dining room so I never felt cramped. This was one of the best hotel finds yet! When I go back to Paris, I will stay there again. BTW, the staff was remarkable! So helpful, so informative and so eager to please their guests! There are not enough stars available to do justice to this great Paris hotel!\n",

In fact we heard no disturbance from renovations anywhere in the hotel.Why do we keep coming back? Well, as most reviewers point out, the location couldn't be bettered. Close proximity to the 'Le Bus' (used to be 'Les Cars') stop for airport transfers; excellent restaurants nearby; spectacular views of the Arc de Triomphe and a floodlit Eiffel Tower - all real plus points.Then there is the hotel itself. We have always found it very quiet, despite the prime location, and always sleep well in its comfortable beds. Rooms are a good size, with fresh décor and immaculate housekeeping. Breakfast is a continental buffet, not elaborate, but everything is of good quality (bread, pastries and fresh fruit salad exceptional), pots of tea or coffee are brought to your table, and buffet items are regularly and quickly topped up so everything is very fresh.Finally, all staff are welcoming and efficient, and seem to take pleasure in ensuring that your stay is a happy one.We shall certainly be back!\n",

      "  review_body : My sister and I spent 4 nights here in May on her first-ever time in Paris (it was my first time back in 30 years). The rate was reasonable and the amenities, especially daily breakfast, were wonderful for the price. The front desk is staffed round-the-clock and nearly all the staff spoke English well enough that we had no problems communicating. The hotel is very close to the Arc du Triomphe, which I worried would mean we were in an overly touristy area. All it turns out to mean is that the hotel is very used to international tourists and is happy to serve them. The breakfast buffet included endless amounts of cafe au lait, cheese, ham, fruit, bread and croissants. The lobby was lovely and the room (especially compared to the \"double\" we had at a budget hotel in London) was spacious enough for two of us to feel comfortable, with a full modern bath (with a tub/shower you could actually turn around in without banging a body part into a fixture!). The location was ideal to hop on the Metro to go anywhere, and just a block or so from the Champs Elysees. We felt safe and comfortable and the staff was friendly and kind. The hotel is on a street with a beer bar on one side and a full-service restaurant immediately across. We also found a small convenience store to buy fruit, snacks and drinks just a few doors down. As newbies in Paris, we didn't spend much time in the room other than sleeping, so we didn't much care that the TV was terrible. Who goes to Paris to watch TV?\n",

      "  review_body : Although we've been to Paris on numerous occasions, this was our first stay in this hotel. From booking to checking out, everything was very easy and professional. It's a lovely hotel, very easy to find and close to a metro station. Although near to the very busy Place de Clichy, the hotel itself has a very quiet, calm atmosphere. Our room was excellent (we had the junior balcony suite). We never made it to breakfast while staying there as we had the best sleep in ages (which says a lot with one of us usually struggling to get a good night's sleep) and took our time relaxing, reading and getting ready in the mornings. The hotel has a very lovely terrace and bar which we used a couple of times. We would have frequented it more but were out late a few times with a couple of rock concerts to attend, friend to meet up with and a night at the annual wine festival (Fête des Vendanges de Montmartre). The thing that really made it a great place to stay was the staff - everyone was so welcoming and friendly and we were greeted with smiles and words wishing us a good day/night no matter what the time of day. I have no hesitation at all in recommending this hotel and next time we visit Paris we will definitely be back!\n",

Every staff member we met were smiling, cheerful, positive and went out of there way to make our stay great. We brought take out back to the room and the front desk agent asked if we wanted to bring plates back to our room! We needed a wine opener and when I went down to the bar, the bartender happily gave me a cork screw and even gave me wine glasses! The next morning we asked a different front desk agent to print off our boarding passes, he did so happily without hesitation.Every business should have staff like at B. We were given a welcome drink to enjoy in the cozy bar which was appreciated and not done enough these days at hotels. In the middle of the hotel is an enclosed courtyard with tropical plants and trees. It would be a nice oasis after a day of touring Paris and something unique. They served breakfast and dinner/drinks on a patio section of the courtyard which was heated (in October) but i would like to go when it was sunny and just relax. Our room had a semi-private balcony overlooking the courtyard but unfortunately we did not get to use it due to the rain and time constraints.  This was a pleasant surprise. Our other options were booked for the night (or too expensive) so we happened upon B. It is now on our short list of places to stay in Paris.\n",

We were a group of 3 friends and the room was very small compared to other hotels we’ve stayed at, but the bathroom was a very good size with a heated toilet, heated towel racks and a very strong shower head which is much appreciated after a 10 hour flight and long days of touring the city! The staff is incredible. Reuben was incredible helpful with all the requests we had and when we asked for something to be sent to our room, it was taken care of in under 5 minutes. He deserves high praise for the customer service and experience he showed us. If you’re looking for huge rooms this isn’t the hotel for you, but if you’re looking for a charming boutique hotel in the middle of the city to get a true experience of Paris and the artistic city of Montmartre I would highly recommend this place!\n",

The rooms are small with small closets (guess most Paris hotels are like that) and the lady, whom I believe was the manager (wish I knew her name), was super nice and accommodating and helped me hang my wedding dress on the curtain rod and provided a steamer so I can have it ready for the special day. Breakfast is great and fresh with fabulous coffee and various kinds of fresh bread and tasty croissants. We originally didn't want to stay in for breakfast but we ended up having breakfast at the hotel most days! Even though breakfast started at 7-8 AM, they made an exception and brought breakfast to our room at 4 am on the morning of our photo shoot that we had to wake up early. They were also very generous and gifted us with a bottle of Champagne for our wedding :)Beds are super comfortable. I have a bad back and can't sleep in most hotel beds but here, I slept like a baby!Location is close to most historic places. We either walked or took a 10-15 min Uber to most places.If you are looking for a nice boutique hotel with great service, nice friendly staff, tasty breakfast and comfi beds, this is the one!

      "  review_body : We were a group of 10 and booked 4 rooms at the hotel for our stay in June. 2 Superior Triple rooms and 2 Classic doubles. Prior to our stay, I contacted the hotel and requested twin beds in all rooms. I received a quick reply from Rubem, with a follow up from Amah, informing me that they would do their best to accommodate us, which they did!If you are an American before you book, make sure to go to their website and check out the room measurements so that you will have an idea of what to expect. The triple rooms were quire ample and those staying in the rooms were quite comfortable, while the classic rooms are cozy but outfitted with the most comfortable beds and great bathrooms. My teenage sons and husband loved their Japanese toilet with heated seats. There are no dresser drawers in the rooms but there is a closet with shelves that you can use to put away your clothing. Included in the price of 2 of the rooms was a daily breakfast buffet which consisted of various buffet style items and juices. Those of us that opted out of the hotel breakfast, enjoyed our daily croissant and fresh squeeze orange juice at the Boulangerie about half a block from the hotel.The hotel has a bar and a great lounge area for one to enjoy a cocktail. There were quite a few guests at night enjoying this feature as well as the outdoor patio where we had our drinks. Pranab, who made our cocktails, is such a wonderful asset to the hotel. We had so many questions about life in Paris and he answered them all with a smile even giving us a little insight into his own life journey.The hotel is equipped with air conditioning and a small elevator. It may take a couple of trips to get your luggage to your room, but it beats walking up the winding stairway.In regard to location, the hotel is centrally situated close to the metro, great restaurants and shopping. The metro (Place de Clichy) is less than 5 minutes from the hotel. There are French, Vietnamese (James Bun – great ginger soda), Japanese, Italian (Tabla Pizza) and Thai restaurants within walking distance, at reasonable prices and great food. Galarie Lafayette is about a 25-minute walk or a couple of minutes by metro from the hotel. Pretty much everything one needs to have a wonderful time in Paris.So, this is why I would give the additional star just for the staff. During our stay, we had a medical emergency which required one of us to be hospitalized. The hotel staff on duty, Amah, Rubem and Hashim contacted a doctor for us and even assisted when an ambulance was required for transport to the hospital. They went above and beyond helping print out e-mails with flight changes and providing those who stayed back with additional accommodations even though the hotel was full. They were outstanding!! We are beyond thankful to them for taking such great care of our loved ones!!We are already planning another trip and there is no where else for us but the B Montmartre.\n",

Didn't dig the layout, but OK. Bathroom was nice. Bidet made the toilet sloped and not comfortable to sit on. I really liked their courtyard and patio adjacent to our room.

Location is great and next to some good restaurnts and the subway station. Neighborhood overall felt safe at night.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was good and we ate it all 3 days even though it was not included in our room rate.Comforter was really thick and required us to really crank the AC to be comfortable while sleeping.

With no lift and a very heavy luggage, it was a real nightmare (even though I must say, the porter was so kind to help me for at least halfway. I still want to thank him).So my suggestion is that you check at which floor you are. Also stairway is so steep that it is also kind of dangerous if you have heavy luggage with you. Secondly, my room was extremely cold because the heating was off and not working. So I asked the porter again to help me on that. He did it, but it took a good 3 hours to get a decent temperature in the room. Quite bad then. In general though, rooms are nice and cozy; shared bathroom more than OK. So I guess I was unlucky.\n",

Our room temperature was that of a sauna with not even a fan available for relief. Heavy cigarette odor in the room as well.

That is a huuuuuge plus.There are also a lot of solid restaurants and markets a short walk way. As for the hotel, we honestly expected a little better considering the great reviews. The room had an ok size, with a sink, mini refrigerator, closet and table. We shared a bathroom on our floor (there are 3 shared bathrooms in the hotel). There was no safe box in the room.The bed wasn't comfortable (mattress felt crooked and made me 'slide' a bit) and the TV didn't work properly. The remote control didn't work at all. The room was properly cleaned everyday, but the bathroom wasn't cleaned with proper frequency, at least considering the amount of guests at the time. By the end of the day, the trash bin was completely stuffed with toilet paper, which can be unpleasant. The staff was nice and took our luggage upstairs when room got ready, since it wasn't ready when we arrived. The reception isn't 24hrs.All in all, it can be worth it if you don't mind the shared bathroom experience (they do offer a private bathroom room for a quite higher rate) and a really simple, one-star level hotel. It is certainly much cheaper than anywhere near the center of Paris. But it wasn't our most comfortable stay ever, that's for sure.\n",

Stairs only, so i had to carry my huge luggage 4 levels up and substandard room with no aircon and it was quite dirty when i went in, like there was dirt on the floor and toilet paper on the floor in the toilet. Honestly i rather pay more to be in a nicer area. But its literally beside the metro so thats extremely convenient. And if you need halal food, its everywhere here!!! Also it came with very simple breakfast of croissants, bread, butter, nutella, jam, banana, cereal and juice to choose from. The 2nd night was extremely warm and having no fan was a killer. The bed was sinking in the middle and i was alone and the pillows were so flat. I could not sleep properly at all. Very disappointed stay. And there is no way to get help for the discomfort i was in. I'll be very honest here, I really would rather pay 20euros more for a hotel that is so much better. Really sorry but thats how i feel after staying in 3 different hotels.\n",

      "  review_body : So, where to begin, we arrived and nice receptionist welcomed us and gave us our key and entry and wifi passes. Aaand thats it for nice stuff. First bad thing was staircase, very narrow, circular and steep. I have 90kg and workout and i barely could cary myself and my gym size bag which was in front of me, upstairs. Second thing, the smell of hotel...something sweet, sour and undefined and unpleasent. No vents and no windows. Room 514 was ok, bed ok, pillows were filled with animal feathers so my wife whom is allergic to it could barely breathe . She took antiallergie meds so it was tolerable.You get bed, small table & chair and sink. Our restrooms and shower was sherable. Toilet seat was not match to the toiletiu and it was broken, so every time you had to sit, you almost fell... Shower was awfull, small, i belive 70x70 cm. And my pug dog has stronger pee pressure than that shower. After aprox 30-40 km of walking and sightseeing, you would like to take a normal shower. No, cant do... its like they see the water consumption so after few minutes, pressure is dropping and warm water is becoming cold... Every floor has it's own wifi. One night, I wasnt too tired so I wanted to watch one or two ep. off anything... Hell noo... laptop/netflix... every few minutes wi-fi was down... pretty frustrating. Ok, i could survive all that but i cant forgive and forget THE breakfast... 1st floor, one hotel room was transformed to a dinning area. 3-4 tables for 2. Baguette pieces,Nutella, jam and butter which wasnt in small packages, it was big brick in fridge from you could help yourselves and 50 people before you... some croissants, juice, milk coffe and thats it. No scrambled eggs. No cereals, nothing... the waitor was an old man in regular clothes, questionable hygiene, looked like i guest that is serving other guests... So of course i ate only one time there... I traveled across the europe and everywhere, the buffet breakfast was great, you can actually feed yourself, and be ready for walking.... It's hostel, not hotel and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone...\n",

      "  review_body : Only drawback to this hotel is no lift, which, after a long trek around Paris, is hard going. We were on the 3rd floor and all floors are accessed by an old, but beautiful, spiral staircase. Check in was smooth, offered help with bags and given a printed map of where to locate car park. The Metro station is located directly outside the front door of the hotel which is great. however after climbing the steps of the Metro to then go up 3 floors is hard work, thank god I wasn't any higher up! For the Metro i would advise you buy a \"carnet\" of 10 tickets for 14,40 euros instead of 1,80 euros each! Room was comfortable and shared bathroom had a great shower. Our room also had a sink and hairdryer. Area was Moroccan/Egyptian/north African community mainly, but very friendly and great little cafes, restaurants and shops. Bakery (patisserie) near car park has the most amazing goods, croissant, cakes allsorts. Portugese custard tarts (Pastel du nata) were the best. All goods cheaper than in centre of Paris. We paid 3,50 euros for pain au chocolate, pain au raisin and a Portugese custard tart. A croissant in centre Paris is a minimum of 2 euros, that was the cheapest we saw!\n",

      "  review_body : What can i say the no lift thing is a huge bummer as we stayed in top floor which is 6 and with a narrow coridor as well as stairs. After traveling through 6 counties in EU, we had a pretty heavy luggages which made it even worse. However the guys who work here are very friendly and helpful. He offered us to get all the bags to the top floor but as it'll be quicker we carried one each.The room is clean and well functioning. Wifi was working great. But the best thing about this hotel is the location the city metro station (line #9 with light green colour) is literally 3 step away (as i counted ) which will take you to the city centre with all the touristic points. And when we came late after visiting the city (after midnight) we wanted to buy some stuff from close by shop, the Carrefour express was closed but when you go out and turn left side there is a little shop operated by Indians was working I think it was 24h shop. My girl friend even found a nail clipper and I bought some beers. To Sum it up the stair thing was not good but good workout for your legs maybe not after full day walk tour around the city. But we really lovex the location and the friendliness of the staff. I would come back again but that time i'll make my reservation with a lower levels. Hope you'll find it usefullThank you\n",

      "  review_body : I must say, we got exactly what we paid for. This has a negative meaning but overall it wasn't anything terrible. First, we were able to get to our hotel from the airport (Charles De Galle) easily. We took the metro line RER B to Line 5 and then Line 9 and the hotel is exactly in front of the metro stop. Overall about a 40 min train ride from the airport to the hotel. The hotel was very quaint however, there are six floors and no elevator. We were on the fifth floor and this was a horrible aspect to our day, especially coming back to the hotel after a long day of exploring the city. We did not have a bathroom in our room. We only had a sink and we had to go past the stair and through a hallway to go to a shared bathroom which had a toilet, small shower and sink. The room was fairly small. I barely had room for my luggage as well as my mother's. The internet was absolutely horrible. It took forever to connect to the internet and even then it wasn't reliable in the slightest. We paid for the breakfast which is something I do not recommend. We paid extra for basically a shot of orange juice and one croissant. There was no fresh fruit options or yogurt or anything. Waste of money in my opinion. However, there is a Lidel supermarket down the street where we bought our own breakfast for the next days. Though very small, everyone who greeted us behind the desk was very nice. One guy spoke enough English to help us get to the city centre which was refreshing. To get to the center is about a 20min metro ride but the metro was extremely easy to navigate for such a large city. The office to check in also had a large assortment of leaflets for what the city had to offer. Overall, this was an okay experience but I would only stay here if I were a poor college kid wanting to travel and not break the bank. Not on vacation with my mother.\n",

      "  review_body : We are a family with two kids - age 7 and 9. We were able to get a family room (double bed for Mom and Dad and two cots for the kids in one room). This made the price better and it was nice to have everyone in the same place. The room was very small but that did not bother us as it was just a place to sleep. It is right on Metro Line 9 which made it easy to get everywhere. (Half an hour or so to Eiffel tower, Musee d'Orlay etc). The included breakfast was excellent - croissant baked on site, bread, corn flakes, fruit salad, nutello and butter. We were also on the 5th floor and there is no elevator so be prepared to lug your suitcases up the a winding small staircase. The internet generally worked well although sometimes you had to be patient as it went in and out.Our two concerns. 1. It was supposed to be no-smoking but our room definitely smelled like smoke as did the hallway outside our room. We left the window open all day to try and air it out. They explained it must have been the person who stayed before us. If you are allergic to smoke or it really bothers you, don't stay here. 2. They had quoted us 94 Euros a night and then when I went to pay, explained there was a tax on top of this. It wasn't a lot (about 4 Euros a night) but I explained that that was something they should have included in the email. After talking they didn't make us pay the tax. Having said that, they were extremely friendly and if we were to go back to Paris, we would stay there again.\n",

Even between the most expensive one.In Paris you have to choose your place depending on the reason why you get there, so if you get in Paris for romance this is not your place, but if you get in the city for business expecially if you need to move quickly in this area or to/from the airport this could be your place. As port Maillot is one of the key place to enter the city and very close to the 16'.A lot of restaurants nearby and walking distance from some key place in Paris as l'Arc de Triomphe or la Tour Eiffel.It's an option in Paris for a godd business trip.\n",

Easy access to two different trains, very close to the super-clean and family friendly Jardin Acclimatation theme park, with a stroll through beautiful fall leaves to get to the decidedly non-commercial, non-corporate sponsorship logo ridden (like US theme parks) - primarily funded by LVMH - which also houses the Frank Gehry designed glass and wood Fondation Louis Vuitton building - which is fun to look at even if you don’t go in. \n",

      "  review_body : Dear Mr David Bruzzone,I am writing to express my deepest appreciation for your assistance when I left a gift, which I had specially bought for my wife's birthday, in the hotel room after checking out. I was on a tour in Europe and had stayed in Hyatt Regency @Étoile in Paris for two nights from 23 to 24 Nov 2019. After having checked out of the hotel on 25 Nov did I only realise that I had left the gift I bought for my wife in the hotel room. By then, I had already left Paris. I was fortunate enough to have the kind assistance of David, who is the Assistant Gouvernant Général / Assistant Executive Housekeeper, helping me through every step of the way, from making sure the item I left in the hotel room was in safekeeping, to the arrangement of UPS express delivery to send the item from Paris to my final destination of stay which was in Crown Plaza Linate in Milan, Italy. He was prompt in replying all my queries in the emails. The item arrived safely to where I was staying without a hitch on 29 Nov. Thank you, David for your excellent service which has made my stay in Hyatt Regency @Étoile a wonderful and memorable one. I will definitely be back to stay in your hotel when I visit Paris again.Warmest RegardsTeo T.P (Singapore)\n",

The rooms were decent for a Paris hotel and with a comfortable bathroom. The lobby is huge and very busy but had a good vibe. There was a young lady in the lobby that walked around and chatted with guests about their experience and day. The reason I gave it only a 4 rating is because of the breakfast experience. There was always a long queue to get into breakfast and then a wait for a free table. There were often no plates available and when there was a plate there was no food items as it got finished. It took time for it to get replenished and we were in a hurry to attend meetings. Croissants were delicious though. Best I’ve tasted in a long while. \n",

The tower lights up at 6 pm and the view from our room was so beautiful. From this hotel you can walk to a few must sees.  The breakfast buffet has plenty of offerings, but the eggs were a bit watery for our taste. Hotel had umbrellas that came in very handy.  The hotel is connected to a mall and plenty of eateries and a handy store in the mall to buy goodies. There is also a Market in the hotel where they sell yogurts, etc vs having to buy a buffet breakfast.  This Hyatt is further from the airport, but located “in” Paris, and closer to the sites we visited. If you can plan your flight to arrive on an early Sunday - it’ll be a breeze to get in and out of Paris. Plus, Hyatt has easy online check out :) \n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile from Nov. 5 to 9, 2019. We arrived after a very unpleasant experience on the RER train...upon entering the hotel we were promptly greeted by a member of the hotel staff who took our luggage so we could check-in. He also took the time to chat with us about our experince on the train and honestly, this helped calm our nerves and was very much appreciated. The check-in staff was also extremely friendly and promptly checked us in.The elevators were very unique as you entered your floor on a key pad and then were directed to a specific elevator.We reserved a high floor, Eiffel Tower room...well worth the cost! The view was amazing and the room, as my wife put it, was very calming. The lobby tended to be very busy as this hotel is attached to a convention center and was the host hotel for Club Brugge who was playing PSG during our stay. Fortunately the lobby is HUGE and gave the hotel a very lively vibe whenever we walked through. The wait for elevators was alsways very minimal, even though it was clearly a busy week at this hotel. Providing a free bottle of water per guest each day from Mayo Market (located just off the lobby) was a nice surprise. This was our frist trip to Paris and definitly not our last. Same goes with the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile, we will definitly be staying here again. \n",

Once it took 25mins in line to get inside resturant to find many empty tables. Everyday was a frustrating experience for breakfast. Buffet is not planned out very well. Elevators also have a line. Must push your room number on a digital pad and wait for one of the six elevators assigned to you. Most times it took several minutes as other elevators came and went. I would recommend to a friend to look else where first. \n",

      "  review_body : Stayed here in May of 2019. When we arrived at the hotel in the morning our rooms (we booked two) weren't ready which is understandable. However, they did not have our rooms ready until nearly 5:00 that evening which is absolutely unacceptable. I asked them to even get just one room ready for us so we could take a nap or relax after a ten-hour flight and no one at the front desk seemed to care. There was some sort of rugby tournament in town with many of the players staying at the hotel so it was busy but I'm an Explorist member with Hyatt and certainly expect to be treated better than having to wait nine hours for ONE available room. Needless to say we were exhausted after finally getting our rooms and so we really felt like it was a lost day in Paris.Having said that, the Club Level room was excellent especially with the wine, beer and food selections. Breakfast is delicious and the snacks throughout the day really help. The fitness center is very good with cardio and weight machines and a weight stack. The rooms are pretty standard but were very clean and well appointed. But for the horrible check-in experience and delays I would have given this hotel a five-star review.\n",

And i say this because as an Eastern traveler I am spoiled by the hospitality and customer care experienced in Easter hotels, I am generally quite unnerved at the lack of it in the western context. That's why this experience has been especially refreshing. I was offered an Eiffel Tower facing room at no extra cost, and the overall experience from there on was really above my expectation.\n",

I chose this hotel due to its good reviews and because it is close to metro station. unfortunately the transport strikes happened and most metro were not running including the one beside hotel place de Italia. Luckily the reception told us of another metro (15 min walk) (olympiades) which took us to our stop (pyramides) near the lourve also the bigbus tour was exactly at this metro station which came in handy for sightseeing. Also we went to disneyland on one of our days because the transport strike was ongoing we booked a private bus to disney and back for €19 each with paris city vision (just a tip for anyone going there during the strikes) The hotel is lovely, good continental breakfast, helpful and pleasant staff, nice neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, cafes, bakerys. We felt safe walking back every evening. The rooms are small as many have stated but when in paris you won't spend too much time in it only to sleep. I would recommend this hotel\n",

There are plenty of excellent restaurants nearby, a grocery store, and a bakery with tasty treats.The room left much to be desired at this price-point. It was tiny; just enough for two single beds and barely any room to put our luggage. The carpet looked pretty old and dirty. We did at least have fresh sheets and towels every day. The bathroom was pretty clean.The staff were friendly, and they spoke English. However, when we ended our stay and had to leave at 5am, the staff at front desk were nowhere to be found. The hotel door was locked, so we were trapped inside while trying to rush out to catch a plane. We had to spend a few minutes poking around to find anyone to help us check out of the hotel.

      "  review_body : Here is my experience in this hotel! DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY REVIEWS! We booked a king bed room and stayed here for 4 nights. The room was ridiculously small. There was literally not enough room to easily open our luggage. Also, somebody stole money from us and from the safe box of our room. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and trusted the hotel due to its high-rates reviews. So here is the story: I left a pouch containing my passport and all my money in the safe box, locked it and left the room for a few hours. After I came back, my password was not working anymore (I am %100 sure that I did not put a wrong password!). So, I told the receptionist and he came by and reset the safe’s lock by a machine and a combination and voila!! He opened it! (What came to my mind instantly was that what kind of manager would leave the reset machine of room’s safe boxes to his staff!!?)Long story short, I felt that the pouch was half opened and when I opened the pouch, I found out that €150 was missing!! I always keep the record of my expenses & my money. I even knew how many 100 bills or 50 bills or etc I had. But I counted them and found out that one 100 bill and one 50 bill were missing. I tried to talk to manager about the incident for two days but she was on vacation. So, after I insisted to watch the video footage of the security camera of the room to see who got into my room in my absence, the receptionist let me watch and I instantly found out that after I left the room, there were some frames (at least 6 min) missing from the video. There was no acceptable explanation on this, other than lies, such as the camera does not record when there is no movement, even though there was absolutely no movement right after the video jumped and etc. So, I filed a complaint with police right away and I’m still following this up to found out what happened to my money. I guess that this happened to so many other guests but since whoever is the thief has been taking \"smartly\" a small portion of one's money, no one got suspicious so far. The worst part was that hotel and the manager DID NOT take any responsibility and even though this incident wasted so much of my time and impacted my whole 4-day trip, the hotel did not even believe that I was telling the truth. About other things, to be fair, I have to mention that there was a receptionist (I dont remember her name) who helped us a lot on our arrival and she gave us so much information on places to visit, restaurants, bars, etc.Also the service on the room and also the breakfast was great.\n",

Although there are lots of restaurants which is just 5-10 mins walk only. They offer free beverage (tea/juice( at the lobby but never got to try it.

      "  review_body : This hotel is all about location, location, location: next to a metro station and bus stop, with lots of restaurants nearby. If you're looking for luxury, find another hotel. La Manufacture consists of two early 20th century apartment buildings transformed into a single hotel. It showed its age when I had to call the concierge to fix two creaky doors used as sound effects in a Frankestein movie. The architect must have been a very thin ascetic who had little use for suitcases or space to turn around. French hotel rooms tend to be small, but for the price charged by La Manufacture, I expected enough space to allow for a single suitcase, my wife and I to be in the room at the same time: Not possible, unless one is on the bed. HOWEVER: the multilingual staff is superbly trained to help, and the nearby metro station and restaurants add to the convenience of staying there. For those who worry about \"security\", the hotel is located in a lively neighborhood and across the street from one of Paris's main police stations. It would be hard to find better at the same price unless you move away from the center, toward the sterile suburbs\n",

The problem is that the really unpleasant thing takes the shine off the rest: the way they bundle the evening meal as part of the package. As far as I can tell, there is no way around this, and the meals, in a mediocre restaurant (L'Entracte) down the street from the hotel, are definitely not desirable--but I'll not go into a lot of detail on that. Otherwise the hotel is quite good. The staff is helpful, pleasant, and multilingual; the lobby area is attractive; the room I have is also attractive and clean and quiet; the hotel is very well located; the breakfasts (fortunately in the hotel itself) are copious, varied, fresh, and the coffee is good.

Location is about 3km from nicer / touristy areas. Gare du Lyon area is a new build office sector with not much to do. Dining options are limited but quite cheap.Hotel sits above a small shopping arcade. Access is from ground floor level up to second floor lobby / check-in / lounge leading to bar and eating area. The dinner \"comfort food\" is actually very nice and good price.There is no gym but big TV in the lounge area and guests do tend to come out of their bedrooms and sit around, drink wine and good coffee. It was lively when we watched part of the Rugby World Cup.The bedrooms are functional. The bed is against the window so one guest has to climb over the other. The washbasin is in the room and there is a cubicle for toilet and shower. The floor is wood, no rugs or carpets. As I said, it is functional. Wi-fi is free, easy to log-in (no code etc) and fast.It is probably worth paying the extra for a view towards the river.The top-floor bar-lounge has great views west towards the centre of Paris. Prices are reasonable and the barman works hard and is cheerful. Some outsiders from nearby offices know and drink in this bar, which is a useful endorsement.Would I go back? \"YES\"for the prices, yes if I was attending Bercy Park for tennis or other event but \"NO\" because it is not a tourist / visitor location and NO because the bedroom seems to intended only for sleep, not staying in.We moved on to the Paris Hilton Opera (4 star also) by Gare Saint Lazare (see separate review). Prices were twice as much but the jump in class was noticeable and justified the price difference.\n",

      "  review_body : Hotel itself is great, very chic and clean, staffs are very friendly and it has a young hip vibe. The lounge and restaurant area is fantastic! The room is small and compact and I love the smartpad control, very cool! I was on the 2nd floor facing street but do not hear anything from the street, but sometimes I hear noisy from other rooms, or room above me, especially when the housekeeper is making the room. One thing I really miss is the coffee/tea in room, it is just unreasonable to go downstairs to get a €3 coffee every time I need it. Location is OK, convenient with metro but no interesting surroundings. Overall it is good easy stay.\n",

Our room was identical to the citizenM hotel we had stayed in in London the previous year—small but with a light airy and comfortable feeling. Pro tip-there is a very large drawer under the bed. Using this for our luggage helped us to make this a very comfortable stay. Our room had an Eiffel Tower view, though it is at an odd angle from the hotel and at a distance. Don’t feel like you’re missing out on anything if you skip the view room—you can just head to the rooftop bar to get the same experience! We had a few housekeeping hiccoughs our last two nights, with housekeeping skipping our room entirely one day (we were out from 7am to 8pm) and giving us a single towel for the room the following night, which the hotel was kind enough to fix quickly. Overall, a very enjoyable visit and would definitely stay here again. \n",

It’s super close to the metro and closeTo some nice hang out spots. The only issue I had was that I couldn’t watch a movie with their smart iPad on my tv or change channels, I called the front desk and complained about it, they said they would come sort it out which they never did till I checked out.Apart from that it was a very relaxing stay which I much needed and I would definitely be back as always.

The black out curtains, the comfy xl bed and air con system. Definitely not stuffy like some other hotels in Paris. Bakery, pharmacy and cafes are all within the vicinity.

      "  review_body : As others stated, this is a clean, friendly, and mildly quirky place to stay and is very, very convenient to the Gare de Lyon station, metro, etc. The quirks? \"Iconic city view\" is true, but seen through a pretty small 3'x4' window at bed level. No way to have look out the window other than being in the bed. The bed, comfortable and large, is wedged against the window wall, so 1) you'd better be ready to climb over the room-side person to get to the bath, 2) you need to climb up on the bed to see out the window, and 3) you need to climb up on the bed to watch the TV! NOT soundproof, either; you can hear the neighbors when the come in, talk, watch TV. Also, this is the only hotel we stayed in without a hot pot for water or tea. YES, the mini-fridge was welcome, and yes, the shower is fantastic, and yes, the electronic controls, including mood lighting, is pretty neat. Good WiFi and AC, and all in all fine. \"Iconic view\" (Eiffel Tower) is far away & tiny in any photo. Can't leave the shade up for romantic views 'cause the folks in the next building look in on your bed! Not lux, not economy, and as long as we're limber enough to clamber around the bed, we'll consider returning.\n",

Facilities - The room although small was designed to maximise the use of space. Awesome shower and clean space.3. THE STAFF!!!!! Oh my soul! I feel like I knew these people for years! A special shout out to Ben, Luis, Thierry & Yvana. Paris, the city of love, was true to its name because of you amazing people. The heart warming signage gesture on my room door of \"Citizen Dragon Queen\" lifted my spirits especially since I was missing my Malamutes (i.e. the dragons ;)) who were back home in South Africa so much! I will forever remember you guys! Hospitality can make or break an experience in a foreign land and it is my understanding that the CitizenM group prides itself on a unique approach when it comes to their guests experience. If this experience was anything to go by, my first choice when travelling to other parts of the world will most certainly be CitizenM.Thanks again and I look forward to returning some day soon!\n",

When our flight was cancelled an hour before our taxi arrived, Franceska called and cancelled the taxi and contacted the airport, so Peter could inquire about our flight. Since they were booked full that night, she called additional hotels and found us new accommodations for that night My husband was stressed and she walked him through the mess we were in.

Our room was very clean and comfortable and very much as advertised. This is a compact, traditional townhouse hotel though our room/en suite was spacious and very well appointed. Despite this hotel’s modest 3 star rating it offers luxury in the details and presents as a stylish and well maintained boutique hotel.Combined with it’s proximity to the Eurostar terminal and it’s position in a ‘foodie’ neighbourhood, Hôtel Helussi would be a tough option to beat for a hotel in it’s class.Just one more thing, the staff at the Helussi were keen to attend to a minor special request asked by us at the time of booking.

The bedroom is basic but the bathroom was well decorated and modern. There is a TV but English speaking channels would be good. The only negative thing is the shower location in the bathroom. The room is on a sloped ceiling and unless you are 4ft 10inches you can’t have a proper shower. The room was cleaned every day but the toilet roll wasn’t replenished but issue was quickly resolved when I spoke to reception. The location is perfect and on a lovely quiet street with a metro station 100m away. Lastly, I need to mention the staff on reception. They are all so welcoming and pleasant.

Just a matter of trust and convenience if you want to charge devices away from you during the night.I did not experience problems with the only two showers per floor (of course in the male washroom, I guess extra two in the female one as well) although I thought it could be too frequented in the morning but it was not... it spreads across the different hours well enough.The iron (for shirts) is fine just the \"ironing board\" is far away from that, hopefully they'll have a real one next time :)Would stay there again!\n",

The server just didnt feel like giving my son a piece of bread for which he asked politely and said he would have to wait. Which would have made him late for his train.

Washroom was in sharing with other rooms on the same floor which again was problematic as generally what I have noticed that dormitories have their private washrooms for 6-8 people whoever stays in the room. There was a different smell (foul) which may be have been because of congestion though washroom was very clean.

      "  review_body : These 3 (three) factors express the main reason that I chose Les Piaules as hostel to stay during my trip in Paris.The price is very affordable, compared to hotels, and Les Piaules is located between two (2) metro station, Belleville and Couronnes.The check-in process is quick, and you'll be given room keycard and a map of nearby interest places. You may rent towel for 2euros, and padlock to keep your bags/luggages safe.I stayed on the Rooftop, totally 4 (four) beds. For me, the room is quite spacious, since its limited space on rooftop. The view is priceless, you can see either Eiffel Tower or Basilica of the Sacred Heart in distance, especially when it is 10 p.m., the Eiffel Tower is full of lights.I prefer room with less beds/people, considering the shared bathroom.The bed is comfortable, complete with blanket, power socket and lights. However, the stairs to the upper bunk bed is troublesome and dangerous. Be careful!The locker rooms are spacious, but awkwardly positioned.During five (5) nights stay, I only tried the breakfast once. I pay 7euros for a cup of coffee and choices of bread (croissant, baguette, etc) with optional jam/honey/butter.Overall I enjoy my stay at Les Piaules, its easy access to metro station, view from rooftop and unique design of hostel. Looks like grand hotel from the outside, located at main street, this hostel is a must-stay for everyone with limited budget to enjoy the stunning Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed for 6 nights in the 6-person female only room. The hostel was as pictured. The rooms and the bathrooms were clean. Some reviews say that the neighbourhood is suspect, but I think it depends on how sheltered you are. It isn't a tourist part of town, but I liked it just fine. It's an easy walk to the Canal St. Martin and there is a nice coffee shop (cafeinoman) and great bakeries within a 10-15 min walk. There are two grocery stores and a pharmacy very close to the hostel which is good because unless you're eating out everyday, you have to go to the grocery store often (because there is no fridge or pantry at the hostel; my main complaint). The rooftop was lovely. As other reviewers noted, there isn't much of a traveler-mingling vibe since the only common space is the bar and it seemed many people visited the bar that were not staying at les piaules. That was fine with me as I didn't particularly want to spend time with other people, but if one of your main goals is to make social connections, this may not be the place for you. Having the metro stops near was great once I got used to the metro system after 2 days. I brought my own earplugs but only had to use them once and it was because of a roommate, not the noise from the bar. I didn't eat anything there, with all the well reviewed bakeries around I didn't see the point! Try boulangarie utopie for a great baugette, also du pain et des idees and liberte bakeries. The privacy curtains on the bunks were great. It gives you the sense of having your own space even when sharing a room and really allowed me to relax. I would stay again.\n",

What is essential to me is cleanliness and the bathroom was emaculate and cleaned regularly throughout my stay. The rooms on the rooftop have ensuite bathrooms shared between 4 people. I was hesitant at the rooms being coed but ended up being fine. On the other hand, the service from the staff was hit and miss. There were 2 stand out people who were helpful and 2 to 3 people who were far from it. I understand that there is no fridge in the hostel but they absolutely refused to let me keep a stick of butter in there. Moreover they lied to me about the size of the fridge and it turned out there is more than one as they prepare food on the premises. The only suggestion they had was that I leave the butter in the room with the Ac on but it hadnt worked the entire time I stayed there and it was boiling! When I mentioned that, they didn't address the AC issue either, just couldn't care less! Moreover my friends and I were hanging out downstairs until after midnight in the common area downstairs when one of the staff asked them to leave immediately for 'safety reasons'. I understand that there is a last call or a curfew but they gave us no warning whatsoever. My friend had to leave with half a pint of beer left. Quite rude! Finally, the location is somewhat to be desired. The area is famous for Asian prostitutes and in fact I saw one being propositioned on the way to the Metro. I didn't dare come back late at night and took a taxi there when I first arrived. Having said that there is security in the hostel so that is somewhat reassuring.\n",

      "  review_body : I booked in this place based on reviews online saying that this was one of the best hostels in Paris. That is a complete lie. Paris was my last stop after traveling through Europe and staying in good and organized hostels. And this one unfortunately was a 1-star hostel compared to the rest.When I arrived at the hostel the receptionist gave us the keys to our room, but when we arrived, our beds were a complete mess (like if someone else have used them). When we complain in the reception, the guy attending it didn’t care and just told us to deal with it, that something like that is common there. So, we had to sleep on dirty sheets.One of the main features that they offer are the beds. They offer that they have everything I need to sleep comfortable. Well I didn’t have a energy socket in my bed, I had to connect my phone on the other side of the room because I had the only bed with no connector.When I wanted to go to the bathroom on my floor, I saw to my surprise a message saying that the bathroom was put of order, that I had to go to another floor.BUT THE WORST THING is the neighborhood. The hostel is in a Chinese neighborhood that is dirty, and also VERY DANGEROUS. When we arrived from the Eiffel tower by using the metro, we were followed by 2 groups of people, we had to go into a store and wait for them to leave. Is unusual to not feel safe on Paris, but this neighborhood will make you feel afraid for your safety.Stay away from this place. Get an Airbnb or a hostel in a different location, you will not enjoy your experience here.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed at Les Piaules for a week and liked it. Great location near two subway stations, clean rooms, comfortable bed with big locker (remember to bring padlock!), clean common toilets & showers. I stayed in room 105 which was right above the bar / reception downstairs and I was first worried about the noise, but actually you couldn't hear much to the room, which was great.One big minus though: no common kitchen. As breakfast was very basic (even the badass breakfast, for 7.5 euros you hardly got anything) it would have been nice to have common kitchen for preparing some snack or breakfast yourself. Now there was no place to store groceries. I think the breakfast was also bit overpriced comparing to other hostels I've stayed e.g. in the UK or US. It would be better that there would be some basic things available like bread, muesli, coffee, juice, fruit etc. which you can take and you pay x amount, instead of being charged separately for juice and so on.Staff was friendly, but lot of the times they didn't pay attention to people approaching the desk or bar downstairs. The toilets in the basement (which I assume were mostly in use of bar visitors during the night) were bit dirty and I mentioned about it to the staff member, who just kind of shrugged his shoulders. Most of the staff seemed to be very young so maybe they are still bit inexperienced in providing customer service.In case you have to store your luggage they have locker room, where you pay 4-5 eur / day for storing your luggage, which was handy. The area is quite nice and there are lot of restaurants. Also within reasonable walking distance from many sights and cool areas. I enjoyed staying here although I wouldn't recommend it for longer stay due to lack of common kitchen.\n",

      "  review_body : Wanted to give it a shot because if you don’t want to spend 200€ per night in Paris, most of the accommodations are really sad … also, I had good times in Tokyo sleeping in capsule hotels and I was re-thinking what’s important or not when travelling. Privacy ? As long as people are playing the game, it’s cool. First night was great (tuesday). Bed is good, there’s a plug and a light next to it and that’s enough. There’s a little locker (don’t forget to bring a lock or buy one for 5€). Showers were clean and I didn’t have to wait although there are only 2 for a whole floor. Second night ? well … less. I went to bed around midnight and around 02:00 the guy above came back … with a girl, and started to have sex. I was happy for him and they were trying their best not to make noises but it was upsetting to be honest. Funny thing is when they fell asleep, the girl started to snore REALLY loud. So much for trying to keep it quite.Personally, I think dorms shouldn’t be mixed. I don’t get why there would be a « female dorm » and not a « male dorm ». Of course, you can state that men have « predatory behaviors » and woman don’t feel safe, I get it, but same here … I don’t have to witness people having sex, especially when it can easily be avoided. If I can add, there’s a « dude vibe » which is not necessary in the showers. Why have « Save water shower together » with 5 characters under it (2 men and 3 women) ? I wanted to check the female bathroom to see if it was the same. Anybody can tell me ?But all in all, a really good place :)\n",

The sfaff, super beautiful (literally) french people. The cleaness was superb, beds comfy, location was great because it wasnt too close but wasnt far either, 2 metro lines are right there outside. I liked Belleville! Cool neighborhood! The terrace maaaaan! Beautiful view of Paris! Bohemian place, met some cool nice people. Breakfast was 3 euro for basic but was okay, then there's the brunch for 15 euros but you can everything you want from 11 til 15! really good. I am just really grateful I stayed at Les Piaules, Friday was cool, they have dj set great music scene! Again awesome people boho chic! Merci Les Piaules!\n",

The hostel is a bit of a walk away from main tourist destinations, but is local in a nice local community if you are willing to explore. Also well connected on metro lines to get you wherever you want very quickly if you don't want to walk. Breakfast options offered a great easy way to start the day. Just down the street from their back patio about 5 minutes are many excellent restaurants. The staff are lovely and very helpful and accommodating.

I especially enjoyed the laid back and casual atmosphere in the cafe/bar where it was easy to meet both tourists and locals. The staff our friendly and there are several events hosted throughout the week (jazz night, happy hour, DJ, etc)The only downside I saw was that on each floor there is only 1 toilet and 2 showers in the guys bathrooms (not sure the situation for girls). It wasnt an issue for me in March, but during busy season this may be an issue. Cleaning staff also cleaned at really strange times. 7a or 8a is not a good time to clean the bathrooms when everyone needs to get in and get ready.Overall very nice stay and I would highly recommend.\n",

As a solo traveler the staff were very helpful in helping me purchase a museum pass and some advice on things to do. The lobby/restaurant area was always busy at night and is a good option for a quick breakfast in the morning or a glass of wine at night. The rooftop terrace is small but offers great views of the Sacre-Couer and Eiffel Tower. The only negative is that it isn't in the best location. Belleville is a trendy neighborhood but can potentially feel sketchy at night. Although the hostel isn't in walking distance to many sites, it has two metro stations within 5 minutes walking that take you anywhere in no more than 20 minutes. Also, if you happen to stay on a Friday there is a wonderful open air market on the street in front of the hostel. Overall, I would recommend staying here.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed at Les Piaules over New Year's. I stayed in one of the rooftop access rooms and it was totally worth it. The room itself was large as was the bathroom, with plenty of room for four people to have their things (if they are tidy). There was even enough space for me to do yoga in the morning. The beds all had their own curtains, lights, and lockers, and the bed itself was firm and comfy, although if you prefer a softer mattress you may not agree. The shower always had hot water. The hostel did offer breakfast for a small fee although I did not partake. It's only a short walk to public transportation and is right across the street from multiple (delicious) restaurants. The downstairs of Les Piaules is quite cozy with multiple tables and couches to choose from - we played cards downstairs multiple nights at the bar. The neighborhood was generally pretty quiet at night. One thing to note is I am a little confused as to whether towels are included in the room, as there were none when we arrived but after the cleaning service came the next day, we all had towels. It is only a 2 euro fee for another towel so it wasn't too inconvenient.Overall I would highly recommend and would stay there again.\n",

It is very close to metro station (only 3meters away) and its very close to the expo center as well which is a big plus if you are visiting Paris for an exhibition. The only thing that needs improvement is the breakfast but not only in terms of quality but logistics as well. The breakfast room is very small and as a result if you try to have breakfast at rush-hours (9:00-10:00) most likely you wont find a table to sit and you will be standing in the line and feeling lucky.\n",

We stayed on the 3rd floor. The suite was big and excellent for our family of four (2 Adults and 2 Kids aged 13 & 8 years old), the stay was very comfortable and sleep quality was very good despite metro and RER line next to the hotel. Tram line 3A and Metro line 13 - Porte de Vanves station & bus stops are right across the hotel and it was excellent for us as we used only the public transport during our entire stay in Paris using Paris Visite travel card. Our stay was made more personalized and comfortable with provided amenities in the suite with microwave oven, kettle, Nespresso coffee machine etc, everyday complimentary Nespresso coffee capsules were a very pleasant surprise . Though not much of convenient stores and restaurants in the area, Porte de Versailles (Expo area) tram station is just 2 stops away with good choice of restaurants to pass a nice time for lunch or dinner. The included complimentary breakfast was good and tasty with good choice of breads, tasty croissant, good choice of yogurt and excellent coffee / hot chocolate. Our interaction with the staff was very minimal as all our requirements were well met. We would definitely stay back here during our next visit. I would have given a full rating for this property if not for very minimal issues ( like complimentary water not provided in the room on our 5th day, breakfast area is small and can get real congested and long time waiting for the tables to get cleared especially when you are with a family of 4 or more) - these are minimal issues which did not bother us much for which I had given a point less.. overall excellent stay at this property for us and would definitely recommend this for families.\n",

      "  review_body : I don't know what else you could want from a hotel. We stayed here for 4 nights this week during a last minute family trip to Paris. Thankfully its a little out of the city because the protests were on so the parts of the centre were closed but we were able to travel freely. We travelled with a child, she loved it. The beds are comfortable, rooms dark, clean and have everything you would need including a microwave and a kitchen sink and a really lovely shower. The little kitchenette saved us a fortune because we were able to nip over to the little market shop over the road and get some cheese and biscuits and just some light stuff so we didn't have to 'eat out' for lunch and dinner, we packed some sandwiches to take around the city with us so we didn't spend so much in the tourist traps. If I had to be critical I'd say - breakfast is lovely continental breakfast with everything you'd want but the same thing everyday. After 4 days I was a bit tired of the same thing - but happy to be fed good quality good at a reasonable price. The rooms are very quiet and I had read that some people were unhappy because they could hear the trains rumbling in their room (the downside of being so close to the metro) - we stayed in 408 and could hear the trains sometimes but this was because the room is generally so quiet but to be honest we're city people so it really didn't bother us. The room was very quiet. Gym was good, check in easy, bedding ok.\n",

The hotel was clean, modern and spacious.The kids stayed in small camp beds which were fine. We had a king. The bathroom was huge with a bath and very large shower. The only thing we disliked was the toilet ( which was separate ) had NO hand basin. So you had to walk the full length of the room to go into the bathroom to wash your hands after using the loo. Bizarrely there was two TVs in the same room.Breakfast was lovely, really good with fresh pastries, yogurt, cheese, eggs, coffee , fruit, chocolate juices and pancakes. The kids were in pancake heaven.Position was good. There was an underground station a few steps away making the train ride to all the sites easily accessible.A carrafour, patisserie and restaurants were all close by ( 2 min walk ).Highly recommended. We would return.Thank you to the hotel for our little treat as we checked in. Really appreciated.\n",

Such collection we will not get in India..\n",

You also can’t just walk around outside your hotel because it’s not in a safe area, very dirty with lots of litter around.

The expectations and high Standard set by Accor Group were not met.The Decor and the look of the Hotel was modern and the Facilities inside the room were adequate.Barring a couple of Staff Members, others were Rude, Impolite and showed a Lack of Professionalism.The Room was Spacious enough to accommodate Separate Bedding for the Kids with Cartoon Character Inspired Bedding, Room Slippers and Eye Mask. That was the only Positive point of our Stay.Breakfast was served till 10 am only. Limited choice of Vegetarian Breakfast.The reason I am giving 3 Stars and not 1 Star is to Encourage and Motivate the Staff and the Management to provide a Superior Service to the Guests and make sure the Hotel Novotel Suites offers a Delightful Experience in the fabulous City of Paris.Location is bit far but well compensated by easy access to the Metro, Tram and Bus.Value for Money is Great for Families but lack of Courteous Staff made it a Regrettable choice.I would not return to this Hotel unless I Read Excellent reviews from Other Guests who Stay at this Hotel.\n",

We liked the location as buses take you to Saint Michel, Les Halles in 20 mins and the metro is at the hotel footsteps. The downside of it is the noise coming from trains that we could hear even though we were on the 9th floor. The staff are friendly and helpful. We asked for them to print out our tickets which they did. The beds are very comfy and quite big. Good bathroom but there is no washbasin in the toilets which is not very convenient nor hygienic.Breakfast was lovely: really tasty products: beautiful madeleines, buttery viennoiserie, selection of cheese, bread, yogurts,...I would go back again.\n",

It may be a little far away from the ''city centre'' , however nearby (20-100 metres away ) is a cornucopia of public transport that one can take to go straight to the city centre, to the airport, to versailles...As far as the hotel room is concerned, it is very convenient and offers usefull amenities such as a microwave oven, a refrigerator, 2 televisions and a big bathroom,ect.It was great being offered coffee capsules, water , tea and biscuits for free every morning.One is not being distracted by noices, since there is double glazzing.Lastly the reception and the staff was very helpfull and kind.I trully suggest this hotel for travellers who want to explore more than the city centre and would prefer for their stay to be in harmony , a little bit away from the too busy streets of paris - dont get this wrong its not that far away, its ideal and really close to the city centre by metro or even bus (bus 95 from the opera)-. But especially for families who need a little more space , the 30m2 hotels' rooms are more than convenient. \n",

Nice neighborhood with local bakery, pharmacy and laundromat just across the street. One negative thing that bothered me is that room windows cannot be opened and you have no control over room temperature (even that you have a climate control in the room - it's locked).The room became too hot and stuffy in nights .

      "  review_body : I'm staying here this week after a week in Novotel Porte D'Orleans a few km away. Of course I can't help but compare but these are quite different hotels. Novotel Suites doesn't have many of the facilities of its near neighbour: No restaurant, no full cooked breakfast. It's probably aimed more towards those who will be getting out an exploring Paris than the business traveller who wants everything in one place. That said, if you do want to stay in your room all week, the microwave and the nearby supermarkets certainly mean it's possible.The area is nothing special but it doesn't take much to stumble on some fantastic food in the neighbourhood. I ate at the Indochine on Rue De Dantzig tonight and it was terrific. The Timbre Poste nearby has a reputation of its own amongst my colleagues. And you can pretty much fall into the Metro if you want to head further afield.My first impression of the room was not great. There is a pullout sofa bed that was pulled out and badly made. As a single traveller I'm not sure why it hadn't been packed away and I ended up doing this myself. Similarly the towels weren't in the state I'd expect from a freshly turned hotel room. I've seen some other comments on here about the housekeeping but on returning to my room this evening it had been nicely made up.Once I'd packed the bed away I have to say the room is fine and in some ways preferable to many hotel rooms in Paris. There is floorspace to exercise in. The bathroom had all the facilities in one place. The bed can be curtained off from the sofa bed. Not everything makes sense - the tv is behind the sofa and not visible from the bed for example (although it is on wheels). Generally though the facilities are clean and the room feels fresh.The noise from traffic and trains is not unbearable from where I am. I certainly slept soundly last night. I can feel the rumble of the metro on occasion but it's not distracting.The restaurant in the lobby area is open and informal. A simple continental breakfast is available and there are plenty of interesting looking books to browse over breakfast. I like the easy informality of this hotel. Despite the niggles I've mentioned I will almost certainly stay here again. I'd definitely consider this hotel for a family trip because of the generously sized bedrooms.\n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I stayed four nights at this hotel. The website gives a reasonable representation of the hotel rooms - but the area around the hotel is not that special. It is next to a railway line and a nondescript boulevard. The positive point is the very spacious rooms - nearly palatial by Paris standards. A lot of people stay here with families and in our room there was a curtain to split the main bed from the sofa beds for the children. The downside however is that the main queen-size bed is quite small. I slept on the sofa bed which was Ok The hotel is not so easy to reach if you are coming from an airport (even though it is next to a metro station) . We came in via CDG , and we transferred at Montparnasse to get there via the metro. There were a lot of steps we had to take with our luggage - this may not be adequate for everybody. We flew out of Orly - there is a 37Euro fixed price for this aiport. You could theoretically take a taxi to Danfert Rochereau / RERB and then use Orlyval or Orlybus to save some money and avoid the metro steps We arrived quite late after 10PM and were happy that the brasserie / zinc accross the road (Marechal Brune) still served food . If you want to eat nearby , then walk in the direction of either the Plaisance or Convenant metro stations. The breakfast at 15€ is Ok but not better than an IBIS breakfast at 9.5€ when I stay for work in the IBIS near Basle. The rooms are sound proof - but I used my earplugs anyway to avoid the train noise in the early morning. For Paris , this hotel had good rooms and a very good price / quality ratio. I would stay here again\n",

You will have a hell of a night with train sound.It is very close to the underground metro station, so it is convenient to travel around. Service and attitude of the staff is extremely poor, way below the Novotel Europe Standard. Anything thing you request you always have to come down, there is no so such thing as room service in this hotel. Staff are also rude, we clearly mentioned that we wanted a noise-free room, but we were given the room facing the railways. Which was terrible and disrupted our sleep for 2 nights. They did not allow us to even change rooms and simply shut us down.They do not want to provide in room slippers as well, the staff in the reception said our room is not an expensive room, so no slippers.Above all, breakfast was even more worst. Same food items is repeated daily. Variety is also very less. More importantly, it does not even look like a dining area, it is so small and cramped. I strongly do not recommend to stay here.If you are looking for hotels, i recommend citadines saint germain-des-pres paris, for the same price and its located in a prime location.\n",

      "  review_body : The hotel is located next to the M13 station Porte de Vanves, next to tram line 3 and the SNCF tracks with shops and restaurants close by. We walked to Tour Eiffel, Quartier Latin and other areas and took the metro back to the hotel.Our room was in one of the upper floors and had a bed for 2 and the sofa bed for 2 teenagers. The room was spacious enough (but missing space to store suitcases) and the curtain helped to give some privacy to parents and kids. We could here the rumbling of the tram metro, but it did not bother us and noticed it only as a background noise. We did not here anything from other rooms or the floor. The room has a fridge and microwave, but is missing plates and cutlery.The staff was friendly and helpful, but sometimes overworked with the breakfast crowd. The breakfast area is too small and can be really busy. Breakfast had all the basics, nothing fancy, but was ok given the price.\n",

      "  review_body : Exact stay date: 26-Jun-2017 for 4 nights, Family with 13 & 7 yrs kids. First why we choose Novotel basically cause they give you a family room with same price of regular double room price. .. in addition to double sofa bed for kids ... that's not all but also kids eat free (of course if you have a meal plan).I was worried only from the location as it is a bit away from attractions center, but it turned out to be a perfect location! The hotel itself looks new and modern, cleanliness was fine, front desk and staff were really kind and helpful. The only thing that if you need some extras like plates, forks. .. , you've to go down and fetch yourself. The room itself was good, a bit tight but cozy. . The only downside -as many complained- that toilet is separated from the bathroom. The bathroom has a good space combining both tub & shower (I would say if they provide only one of them there would be a nice space for toilet inside the bathroom)Now back to location: it's really -letterly- true that the metro at door step! (Metro line M13) and a few meters away there's also a tram stop (no. 3 & 3a) Port de Vanves is name of stop for both. It's almost 20 mind. away from most of famous Paris attraction and Mr. Google Maps will professionally guide your way.And here you find all you need around you, restaurants, grocery, bakery laundary, cafes, barbershop, .... and many more only you need to cross the road! And not to mention you pay like a local!Some people copmlined about the noise from the trains, to be honest I could hardly notice it (knowing that I'm really such sensitive to such noises)Our stay was including the breakfast l and it was good (small, simple and not too many varieties but it was good enough to fuel for long day)Overall we liked our stay there and we really recommend it for families, and for sure if we get the chance to come back we will happily do it.\n",

Bed was very comfortable with nice linen and lovely towels. The only downside is that the hotel is right on the train line and the rumble from the trains is rather disturbing. We were on the 3rd floor so my tip is to ask for a higher floor facing the road .The room has a kettle and coffee machine, Nespresso pods. And herbal teas.It is good value at about 100 euros a night.

Is not within the hustle and bustle of the arrondissements close the the Seine and it has a metro station at its doorstep (Porte de Vanves). Literally at its doorstep. The staff at the hotel all speak English, not that you shouldn't try and speak French, and their assistance and tips are fantastic.

We called, emailed and contacted numerous times the hotel and mostly they ignored us. I have contacted them see if we could move the stay, get a part refund or credit due to the situation and they basically told us to go away. I appreciate rules but the hotel we were stuck in went above and beyond to help us. Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles did NOTHING. Disgusting and this means I will now avoid this chain for business or personal. Takes NOTHING for a multi million $ company to do something small.\n",

      "  review_body : A lovely hotel in a perfect location. 10min taxi ride from Gare du Nord, near a metro station which takes you to the Opera Garnier area in 2 stops, close to lots of nice bars and restaurants. The hotel at first looks very good, it has recently been renovated however, some classic and superior rooms look half renovated and half not. Meaning: all new furniture, modern look to it but the bathroom is old/outdated and therefore looks dirty. Bathroom doors with holes in it and not enough closet space. We changed rooms, were placed in another superior room and this one was perfect (how it should be). Completely renovated, also new bathroom and enough closet space. The breakfast was perfect as well, lots of choice (also when on a diet). They have a direct line with the taxi service so a taxi can be arranged by the hotel. One note on the beds: they felt like wooden planks. Outside on the terrace they have cute little iglo’s in which you can sit and have drinks. Overall an ok experience, I would recommend the hotel just make sure you have a good room. Personally I like the Mercure Opera Garnier better. \n",

There was a small glass door but I still ended up getting water all over the floor. Also the tub is deep so it can be a problem getting in and out. I would recommend this hotel.

      "  review_body : I stay in hotels 40 weeks a year and this was by far the most disappointing hotel that I have stayed in. The positives are that it is in a good location, with plenty of good restaurants near by and the rooms are quite and reasonably clean. The negatives, the bed was so hard and the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on, the bash/shower was so narrow that I had to stand side ways in it and when sitting on the toilet if you leaned forward you banged your head on the door. The bedrooms are a reasonable size so I don't understand why the have skimped on the bathrooms. My rate included breakfast which was not too bad on the first two mornings but on my last morning the bacon and egg servers were empty and were only refilled as I was leaving twenty minutes later. I wanted to have a cup of tea but the hot water machine was broken, I did eventually find one that worked after asking three members of staff. A business colleague of mine was also staying at the hotel and he agreed with everything that I have stated above. To conclude, when checking out I was not asked how my stay was and I put this down to the number of complaints that they must receive.I will not be staying there again.\n",

      "  review_body : I was impressed with how modern this hotel is. The room was a decent size for Europe. I liked how the toilet was in its own little closet from the sink/shower. The shower did tend to spray water all over the tile floor, though, because it only had an artsy glass wall that didn't do a good job of blocking water. It wasn't super noisy. The breakfast was GREAT! Their croissants tasted freshly homemade and were delicious. They had tons of food choices, and the breakfast area was large and nice. The ONLY negative to this hotel is that the area seems a little sketchy... even one of the nearby shop owners told us to keep our bags and things close to our body and to watch out. But... I think a lot of Paris is like that, not just this area.It's a very short walk to the subway station. We also walked to Moulin Rouge, and there are a lot of great restaurants and shops within a block. I'd definitely stay here again.\n",

Having visited Paris regularly in the last 4 years we were pleasantly surprised by the room . The room was a very good size with a large firm bed, wet room, fridge and kettle. Looking out the window you get a view of the Sacre Coeur . Breakfast was fantastic with both a continental selection and hot choice. Machines for tea and coffees. Staff were very helpful and friendly.The hotel is in walking distance of the Sacre Couer and Moulin Rouge and local shops and restaurants . Uber Taxi to Champs Elyse was €9 in the day and the Eiffel Tower was €11 . We enjoyed a nice glass of wine in the bar and at €6.50 it was a very good price for Paris . Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely look at stopping here again. Couldn’t understand the criticisms on Trip Advisor before we came as this hotel is fantastic compared to others in Paris in this price range .Taxi from train station €9 to hotel \n",

Although the hotel is not in central Paris, our very modern room even had a view of the Eiffel Tower. I especially cannot thank Bruna enough for making our Paris holiday so enjoyable. She and Melissa helped us find places, get tickets, arrange transportation, and made our stay very memorable. They both deserve the highest praise! Bruna even helped move us to a room closer to the elevator because my husband has trouble walking.

We are in the 2nd night of a 3 night stay and the experience has been awful.The staff have been spectacularly unhelpful, rude and dismissive. At check-in, the staff member's default response was to say 'No', even before we had finished asking a question. This was particularly annoying when we were giving her our name to allow us to check-in and she did not allow us to finish before saying 'no'! Another staff member's response to our concern about the harm the bed was causing was to say \"what do you want me to do about it?\" Management obviously have no interest in recruiting quality staff with good customer care skills. Perhaps the current crop of employees are cheaper and less skilled?Our first room had a defective bed mechanism and we were moved to another room (822) after much insisting.The second room's bed was so hard that we asked for a mattress topper to provide extra padding but 2 nights later we are still waiting despite several requests. When I woke up this morning, I could not stand straight due to back-ache and advised the hotel of this but there was still no solution offered to help.When we stayed previously, we would spend an additional several hundred dollars with breakfasts and in the bar (champagne cocktails and snacks). This time, the appalling customer service has meant that we will not be spending one extra euro at this hotel. Not one. If only all customers would do the same, perhaps management would get the message.Another issue is that this is so obviously not a 4* hotel. There are paper cups in the rooms, plastic glasses, no tea and no furniture at the bed-sides. Please note that we did book the best quality room the hotel offers. So, au revoir Mercure Hotels. We will not be staying with you again.A final message to the management, please do not respond to this message with empty platitudes and a promise to do better next time. Please do better this time during our current stay if you are really serious about customer service. Otherwise, save your time and your comments for those who may believe them. And, if you are really concerned about providing a good customer experience, start with hiring competent staff!\n",

The room us small, thought that is not unexpected, but the really brutal part was the bed and pillows. I ended my stay in Paris with a seriously bad back and I give the credit for this to the horrible bed, which also made sleep difficult.On the plus side, we had a great view from the room and Steve, at reception, was especially nice and deserves a mention.

      "  review_body : Hi. My daughter and I recently had a very enjoyable stay at the Mercure Montmartre, as a treat to celebrate her 18th birthday. On arrival there, we were given a room upgrade and a little present for daughter's 18th. This was hugely appreciated, and got our trip off to a really great start. The staff are very polite, courteous and helpful. Thanks in particular to Jordan for the very warm welcome, and for making our stay extra special!The room was lovely and very clean. I loved all the little extra touches, like the high quality toiletries and coffee machine (which could also simply heat the water for tea, if coffee isn't your thing). There was also a fridge with complimentary refreshments, and perfect for keeping fresh milk, for said tea! The safe also came in very handy.Wifi was excellent and never cut out, unlike many other hotels I've stayed at.Bed was comfortable, thus ensuring a good night's sleep. The hotel was also lovely and quiet inside.We loved the breakfast and the choice was good too; there was always plenty of food, providing you with the perfect start to a day's sightseeing.The location is good, and the closest metro station (Place de Clichy) is a couple minutes' walk away. The area is more Pigalle than Montmartre (the Moulin Rouge is round the corner!), and as such is a bit sleazy at night, with all the sex shops. My teenage daughter wasn't a fan, but this was her first time in Paris, and I am well enough acquainted with it to know that it's perfectly safe. And the seediness is easily avoided, if like my daughter you have no wish to embrace it :) There is also plenty of places to eat and drink locally, plus a Monoprix supermarket on the main Street near the Moulin Rouge/Blanche metro station. Paris really is incredibly expensive these days, so I found it helped to be able to pack the odd picnic with fresh ingredients from the supermarket, or even just buy treats and bottles of water for the room.I hope this review helps, and if you have already booked or are thinking of booking, please don't be put off by the more negative reviews. The hotel itself is beautiful and I wouldn't hesitate to return.\n",

He just told us to go to a mile away police station to fill out the report. However, when we got there the police officer told us they don´t speak english and tried to send us to another station far away. We think MERCURE could do better than this.

The room was ok and as mentioned by others the toilet is separated completely from the sink and bathroom. Wifi quality was good. As mentioned in other reviews the staff (seeming inexperienced) do start putting away the breakfast as of 9:30 am (breakfast is supposed to be till 10) and this happened on multiple days when we had breakfast after 9. The lady who manages the breakfast area is rude. I spoke to her about the noise, food being removed and stress added to the environment from the early cleanup. She called in her boss and I spoke to him. When he went to discuss with her, she started yelling at him in front of everyone. Very strange behaviour to be tolerated at a hotel. \n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at this location for one day and we did not get to spend much time exploring because we were on a tour. The check in was easy and the location is in a cute area. The building is old but updated inside. There are three elevators, but they are small and hold maybe three people. The rooms are updated and decorated nicely. Just be warned that the rooms are not big because you do not stay in the room much. My son was in shock that you had to put a room key in a place in the way to get the lights and air to turn on. The toilet was separate from the shower and sink area. They provided on the wall body wash and shampoo in one. I did not mind it but the wife did not like it for the hair. The shower was awkward because there is a half glass wall acting as the shower door but it does not stop anything. The water pressure was fine and the temperature was good. The bed situation is not like America and you have to hope your get a queen size bed, it is usually two twins pushed together. My son was on a pull out coach that he said was fairly comfortable. Our bed was very firm and you only get one pillow a person (ask for more when you check in because they are very small and thin). We heard no noise in the room even though we were on the third floor and along the busy street. The breakfast was very good with a wide variety of foods (bread, croissants, cheeses, fruits, crepes). The staff was very helpful and attentive to helping you figure out what things are. After an easy check out, we had a few seconds to see the neighborhood. It was very local’ish and there was so many neat buildings. We did notice that everything closes early and opens late.\n",

I was utterly disappointed with Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacré Coeur, though. My mattress was broken and when I asked staff to attend to it - nothing happened. It was two of us sharing the room, yet the room cleaning gave us only 1 towel. We made a coffee in the morning and the cleaner left the used old paper cup (to be reused?) but again, only 1. There were no “usual” amenities (eg body lotion, hair conditioner...). I would not recommend this hotel and I certainly won’t be staying there again. I had 2 nights of very little sleep due to being uncomfortable, paid £172 per a night and didn’t even get customer service!! Shame on you, Mercure!\n",

      "  review_body : Far and away, one of the most outright unattractive and uncomfortable hotels I've ever stayed in. Really hard to know where to begin with this one... Even by Parisian standards, the rudeness of the staff at the Mercure Paris Montmartre Sacre Coeur takes the cake. Upon arrival, we were told by M. Andy at the reception desk that, although our 4-night reservation had been prepaid by my sister with her credit card (and deducted from her account) as a gift to us and our names were on our copies of the reservation confrimation, which we presented along with our passports as proof of our identities that this was insufficient and that, as far as he was concerned, we might be perpetrating a well-known scam currently being suffered by many hotels in Paris (this is verbatim) M. Andy could not check us in unless we presented him with a photocopy of my sister's credit card. Momentarily, I was so stunned that I was unable to speak. I quickly regained enough nerve (I am 65 yrs old, by the way) to explain to the \"gentleman\" that this was going to be hard to do as she was, at that moment, aboard the Eurostar on her way back to Paris (where she has lived for 50 years and where we had just arrived to celebrate her 63rd birthday). I then proceeded to give M. Andy what for, even as my French brother-in-law simultaneously spoke to him on the phone FROM the Eurostar. Only very slightly fazed by this, M. Andy informed me that, as I was so \"ennervé\", he would allow me and my partner access to our room if we paid a cash \"deposit\" (for what???) of 150 Euros that I had to sign (the logic behind my signing a receipt for cash I paid to the hotel still eludes me). I do not usually travel w/out cash and was fortunately able to peel off three 50 Euro bills. I should add that my French is fluent. It wasn't until after I entered the ugliest hotel room I have ever seen in my life that it occurred to me to march back downstairs and ask for a photocopy of said receipt.The place is as cheap as it is ugly. if you like FELT bedcoverings, this is the place for you... with not a single drawer in sight, every detail of the decor is horrid, red being the predominant color in room 123. Blurry red trees on the curtains, thin striping in various shades of red on the carpet, a red bed board and red details on the walls. Two extra pillows were on the floor in plastic bags. The shower leaks badly. All in all, a disaster. Forwewarned is forearmed.\n",

The hotel is perfectly located for visiting the fabulous area Montmartre, excellent metro connections and general nightlife. To be perfectly honest, the staff were very good - polite, helpful and friendly. The food at breakfast was very good, not a massive choice but everything was good quality - more than adequate and the hotel is very clean. Our disappointment was with the room and the facilities in the room. It was on the seventh floor and so had a pretty good view of the city and very clean. The bed was massive and very comfortable with lovely 'squidgy' pillows! However, the fridge which I presume had originally been for a mini bar held one complimentary bottle of water and two plastic (yes, plastic!) glasses. Contents not really what you would call a mini-bar! There was a kettle for tea/coffee making and a couple of sachets of coffee/tea//sugar making but there were two cardboard/plastic cups - not real cups!In the bathroom, which was ok but needed updating i.e. flaking paint on the walls, there weren't any complimentary toiletries just a tiny bar of soap and a bottle of shower gel/shampoo and, guess what, two plastic glasses! Yes, nothing in the room was real and this is supposed to be a four star hotel! No glass glasses, no real cups! Our previous experiences of Mercures have been so good in the past but this one didn't quite make the mark and I'd LOVE to know why a four star hotel doesn't provide a little more luxury for it's 'four star' guests!\n",

The cost was £463 each for return flight, 7 days hotel with bed and breakfast.We got an Uber to and from the airport to the hotel for €40.Hotel locationThe hotel is located in a great area. Round the corner from the Moulin Rouge. It is situated in between 2 metro stops - Place de Clichy and Blanche, which were both 2 minutes walk away. There are loads of restaurants nearby as well as shops. There is a small supermarket nearby called G20 at Rue de Douai, just across from the Place de Clichy metro - able to buy 1.5 litre bottle of water for 20 cents. Lots of choice of wine at low prices.Great to use the smartphone app ‘Next Stop Paris’ which is brill for advising metro lines etc. to take to get around.HotelStaff friendly and helpful. Nice reception area. Nice fresh smell.Our room number 622 had a huge sized double bed. Bed comfy, pillows ok, but soft for my liking. There was a bath with an overhanging shower and a sink. Toilet was in a separate room next to it.Room nicely spacious. Lots of plugs and lights. Table to sit at. Wardrobe and shelves - only 3 hangers each though. Fridge to use, and complimentary bottled still water for first night. Kettle with tea / coffee available to use too. Lots of space in bathroom for toiletries. Shower gel and soap available. Safe in room - no extra charge. Big TV although never switched on. Very clean and tidy. WiFi good in the room. Air conditioning did not seem good as room not cooled - we left off.

      "  review_body : Yes, I realize that 4 stars in Europe is different from the same ranking in The USA. This hotel is clean and well designed. The modern interior design is welcoming. The reception staff speak English, and since I know 15 words of French (10 are numbers) that was very helpful. The beds and pillows are comfortable. The modest rooms had newer fixtures and provide 1 queen or 2 twins (we had 3 rooms). We arrived at noon and didn't have to wait until the normal check in time of 3pm to get rooms. Our rooms were not together, but all on the same floor. The 4 star rating seems generous for the following reasons. One of our rooms had a phone that didn't work and it took many calls and 2 stops by the front desk to get it fixed (temporarily fixed). This hotel does not provided shampoo, conditioner, or body lotion. They have a wall mounted shower gel that is supposed to do it all, but it is not good on hair. My wife and 3 children used it the first night and each complained of how it dried out and damaged their hair. I had to buy shampoo and conditioner from a store. The TVs get many channels, but only 2 provided content in English (BBC News and CNN). My daughter's watched Disney Channel in French (they don't speak French). One of the small refrigerators in our rooms didn't get cold, but we had 2 other rooms with working ones. There was construction going on every day in/on the building. Each morning we would wake up to the sound of pounding hammers, saws, and drills. It was so loud I think they were in the next room. We could hear it from all 3 third floor rooms. Finally and most bothersome was the lack of climate control in the rooms. Our rooms got so uncomfortably hot each night that we woke up in puddles of sweat. It was 45° outside, but in our rooms it was closer to 80°. The hotel staff told me to turn down the thermostat, but we had already tried that. After several inqueries the hotel sent up a technician who told us the hotel has the AC and fan turned off in the winter and to open a window. That didn't help and I will be hearing the sound of French sirens in my head for weeks. For these reasons, I can not recommend this hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : First time visit to Paris with my wife to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. Selected this hotel from a group offered by Easyjet in one of their packages and based on reviews in TA; we made a good choice. This is a large modern hotel on the edge of Montmartre, close to both Place de Clichy and Blanche Metro stations, although we found the former more convenient as it served a number of Metro lines, whereas Blanche only one. The hotel is well situated for cafes & restaurants and a short walk into the main hub of Montmartre village; also 5 mins walk from Moulin Rouge We were only on B & B, as the hotel doesn't do lunch or evening meals, but with the plethora of eateries nearby, we never found this a problem. The breakfasts were brilliant, not only featuring the expected Continental Buffet style, but also scrambled egg, bacon & sausage. We were given a standard room on the 5th floor which was spotless, well serviced, with a very comfortable large bed, well appointed bathroom, with separate toilet room, fridge & safe. Only downside, a lack of storage space,eg no drawers, but what was there was sufficient to store what belongings we had for a 4 day stay. The table and chairs were small and badly lit, no bedside tables/drawers we also found a niggle. We found the staff friendly & helpful and in our short stay noted a high incidence of comings & goings, so the Hotel is v popular indeed. What I did find disappointing however, was the fact that having read about previous guests getting upgrades,or some recognition of special reasons for the visit, I wrote to the hotel, well before we were due to arrive, informing them that it was our first time in Paris and a special Anniversary, and they acknowledged my request. However on arrival they were not prepared to Upgrade although I gathered that there were Privilege Rooms available. Nevertheless I am not going to reduce my grading as overall this is an excellently situated hotel and one we hope to stay in, next time we visit Paris. Highly Recommended.\n",

Rooms where spotless and plenty of amenities, didn't have to ask for extra. Breakfast was full of choices. Location was great ideal for people who want to either walk around or go on the metro.Being super critical here but only problems were the beds being slightly hard but that due to personal preference and our toilet being separate from the en suite sink and shower.

The moment we stepped into the hostel, it felt warm and cosy with families staying there. We knew we had made the right decision staying there. Got the private suites (2 rooms) and they both come with a lovely balcony. Although the rooms are on the smaller side, it’s definitely value for money plus we’re hardly in the room for most of the day. The kids were comfortable and most importantly for me, the rooms are very clean. Love the Cocinelle supermarket around the corner and for muslim travellers, halal food is easily accessible just opposite the hostel.\n",

The issue was I wanted the view. The issue was when I call front desk and tell them we don’t have toilet paper when first getting in our room, the least they can do is try to accommodate or not ask us to walk down stairs to get toilet paper. If you want to stay here my advise is make sure you get in contact before you swipe your card and tell them exactly what you wants and we’re in the street do you want you room. Also, there was a gentlemen, completely unhelpful. Point us to the wrong direction and it caused us to miss our paid tours. \n",

      "  review_body : I stayed 3 nights with my teenage twin daughters in August 2019 and we loved it. I booked a quadruple room (a double and a bunk) with an ensuite and it was very clean and stylish. The photos were completely honest. We were on the top floor (room 604) and we had a little balcony which had the most stunning view of the Sacre Coeur. Towels were provided and the room was cleaned every day. The staff were very friendly and relaxed; particularly Fernando who checked us in. I do not know what the other rooms are like so can't comment on those. The Sacre Coeur is literally a 10 minute walk away and it is a wonderful part of Paris. We had some lovely meals out and the Montmartre museum is well worth a visit. One word of warning about Paris in general..... I had my mobile phone stolen on the metro by a very crafty pickpocket and I also witnessed a Spanish lady have her whole bag stolen (including passports etc.) whilst she was sitting outside a café in Montmartre. This was a sad part of our trip as we had to spend a whole afternoon trying to find a police station to report the crime. Do look after your valuables (my phone was in a cross-body bag but the pickpocket managed to undo the zip without me noticing). This has not put me off visiting Paris but next time I would take a thief-proof bag and be extra cautious. I would definitely stay at Le Regent again as I felt very safe there.\n",

The location is good, you can reach the Sacré-Coeur within 10 minutes. Our room had a beautiful design, it looked excactly like the picture in the website, we had a bathroom including some soap, shampoo and towels and the bed was very comfortable. We also had our own water boiler, two mugs, tea and coffee.The balcony with two chairs was really cute and had an amazing view. The hostel in general is very clean the staff is always friendly and welcoming. The only negative things to mention are that there was no space in our room to leave our clothes (not even a shelve)- the room in general was small but because we had to live out of our suitcases it was just a little bit too tiny.The kitchen is very small too and there is not enough equipment like bowls etc. I also would not recommend to buy breakfast for 6€ each morning (it’s only a croissant, some baguette, one orange juice, one instant coffee drink and some marmalade- I know it’s typically Parisian but you could get it much cheaper at any supermarket!) But all together I really enjoyed my stay at the “Regent Montmartre” and I would recommend it to everyone that wants to visit Paris in a chic location without spending too much money!\n",

The bathroom is big and has everything you need. Our room view was absolutely perfect, right in front of Sacre Cour! We were amazed since the first time we saw the view, it turned our visit even more magical. We didn't hear any noise from other rooms, and the hostel has a calm and peacefull athmosphere. The guy from reception was beyond sweet, he is from Chile so we've been able to talk to him in spanish/portuguese, that was really helpfull. People in Paris are always rude, and this guy was extremly nice and friendly, always worrying about us. The breakfast is simple but good, but the breakfast lady is always rude. Literally she yelled at me for not speaking french to her, but on our last day she answered to me in english so I guess she spend the other 2 days pretending she didn't speak english.The hotel is very, very close to Anvers metro station, but please never go to Barbès-Rochechouart metro station, especially if you are a girl. Me and my friends (all girls) went to that station (5 minutes walk from the hostel, because we want to pick line 4), and it is an extremly terrible area for girls to walk alone.The only bad thing about this hotel is the breakfast lady, and the fact that the room can be very hot sometimes, but if you open the windows at night it colds the room very fast (and no mosquitos enter the room, which is a plus for me because I am allergic).

Highly recommended for staying in Double rooms.\n",

But most of all we were stunned by the incredible view of Sacre Coeur! We were very lucky and had a gorgeous sunset that we watched from our own little balcony. The location was also very good. Compared to the price we would have paid for a similar room in a hotel, this was an absolute bargain and I will totally stay here again and recommend it to friends & family. That being said, please be aware that this is a hostel after all and there was quite some noise from the people going in and out of there dorms at ungodly hours and the walls seemed to be paper thin - we could hear both our neighours quite clearly.\n",

The kitchen was a life saver for those on a tight food budget since you could buy noodles from the supermarket and cook them in the kitchen. The location was very close to Anvers metro station so it was easy to travel around every morning. Staff were very friendly and all the facilities were available at hand. Next time I visit I will definitely be returning to this hostel. One thing to mention is that there are lots of delicious breakfast areas nearby and far away (but that wouldn’t be a problem since the metro is so close) so there is no need to buy the included breakfast since I believe you would miss out on the boulangeries and patisseries that sell handmade delicacies. Also, for us at least, there is no wardrobe so you would probably need to store your clothes in your suitcase which may be slightly inconvenient.\n",

Every window and door was locked when we left for 3 hours. We called the police and they were helpful in filing a police report. They even mentioned that the door handle seemed faulty and un-safe and that it probably wouldn’t have been hard to break in. The next morning we checked out and demanded a full refund for the 4 nights so we could go to a different, safer hotel. The staff was super unapologetic and only would refund us for 3 of the nights.

The 4-bed dorm room was spacious enough but there was a very slightly funky smell in the bathroom when we checked in and even right after it had been cleaned by housekeeping. But those are minor complaints and not really deal-breakers. The many pros: (1) Location right next to Anvers station, in the atmospheric Montmartre area. (2) For families with kids, there's a small park with a playground just across the road. (3) The lady at reception (Clara, iirc) was friendly, welcoming, and efficient. (4) And there's a lift, which not all hostels or even hotels have. (5) The 4-bed dorm room has a balcony overlooking the Blvd de Rochechouart. (6) There's a Carrefour nearby, great for shopping for food and other essentials. (7) The kitchen/dining area, though small, was sufficient. Overall, no regrets staying at Le Regent Montmartre.\n",

On saying that we were only there 2 nights and the beds were comfy and the shower was good which is all that matters as your hardly in your room on a city break.

We kept clarifying that it was fine if not possible but that person seemed more adamant about being emotional than solving anything. There were also bed bugs present.

It smelled of urine so bad. When i returned to the hostel after dinner, it smelled even worse and I asked to be moved. I got sent to the 5th floor (with all my bags) only to find that the room was fully occupied by 4 sleeping people.Eventually i got moved AGAIN and ended up in a 4 bed dorm overlooking the sacre couer! AMAZING viewIt was annoying getting to a bed with just a stack of sheets and blankets, having to make the bed at midnight before i could sleep.No mat in the bathroom - floor was always wet after showeringKitchen was great - enough space in the fridge to store groceries.Not a very social environmentWifi was slow from 5pm and unreliableLocation within steps of anvers and Barbes Rochechouart and Pigalle a little further away.

      "  review_body : Perfect city center to explore Paris. Anvers metro station (also the closest to the Hostel) is 90 seconds walk and hooks you up with the entire Paris metro and one is free to explore the city at one's will. One can easily spend a day around Sacre Coeur, a stone throw away from the hostel and indulge in the gourmet delicacies of bounty cafes in the vicinity. A night show at Moulin Rouge is 15-20 minutes walk as are some sex shops.Loved my stay here with a bunch of seven friends. Make sure to write 'room with a view' when you book. We didn't and as a result got a boring room but some of my friends were lucky to get an extraordinary view of the Sacre Coeur from their balcony. Feedback to the hostel: You should stock up enough breakfast to suffice all occupants. On some of the days when we came late for breakfast (say 9:00 am), there weren't enough croissants for all of us. The hostel as such is very chic and the folks working there are friendly. I would definitely stay here again during my next visit and ask for 'room with a view'.\n",

      "  review_body : We had a room on the 5th floor and stayed for 3 nights. The room was small and outdated. The walls were very thin, you could hear the conversation in the next room; old doors which made very loud noise, especially when people came in late at night or left early in the morning. Good thing I had ear plugs, or else I wouldn't have been able to sleep very much. After we checked in, we realized the room hadn't been cleaned properly. Trash from the previous occupants was still in the bathroom. We asked at the reception for someone to come clean it, but nothing was done until the next day when they normally cleaned the room. The room had a bad odor, probably from old rugs. On the positive side, the location of the hotel is very good. Lots of restaurants and bistros nearby, a Metro stop right across the street made it easy to get to the hotel from the airport using the train and the Metro - about 45 minutes. Also, Montparnasse train station is a few minutes walking distance and there are direct trains to Versailles - about 1/2 hour ride. Walking distance to the beautiful Jardin du Luxembourg. There is also a nice daily craft or farmers market, depending on the day, up until noon in the median across from the hotel. Would I stay there again? Probably not.\n",

      "  review_body : Hotel Odessa is an excellent choice for those who like a lively part of Paris, within easy walking distance of Gare Montparnasse and Le Bus Direct stop from the airports. It's also right next to the Edgar Quinet metro stop, so it's very easy to get to. There are many foreign travelers there, but it's not really a tourist center like Notre Dame or the Eiffel Tower, so you don't have to push through hordes of tour groups (a big plus, in my opinion!) There are many cafes and restaurants nearby--one right below the hotel---and quite a few shops in the area.The rooms seem to have been newly decorated. They're small, like most Paris hotel rooms, but very clean, with comfortable beds. There's also a (typical in Paris) tiny elevator.Drawbacks are minor. The neighborhood can get noisy at night, which isn't a problem if you're on an upper floor (I recommend the 6th floor!) or if you plan to keep the windows closed. They don't have a breakfast room, but they will bring breakfast to you in your room if you order it, and it's a very decent bargain for 8.50 euros. This is NOT a luxury hotel. It's more for the budget minded, but for people who aren't expecting big rooms, baskets of free toiletries (they do have soap dispensers) and refrigerators, it's a solid choice.\n",

The room is small but great, but the main thing is that the double glazing is so good you really cannot hear the nightlife below but you get to admire it all without the noise. FAB FAB LOCATION.\n",

      "  review_body : The only good thing about this hotel is the location (as it is near metro stations, restaurants, caffes, shops...). Beside that, it was the worst hotel experience for me and my husband. The room was small and very very basic. The shower had no curtains so every time we showered the whole bathroom floods with water. Very thin walls and no sound proof (we woke up very early everyday from the talking and door sounds of the neighboring rooms). The breakfast is very poor (we had much better breakfasts in Paris in other hotels, for the same price). And to top all this, my husband's sun glasses got stolen from the room. When we reported to the reception, they said they will check this out... Later on the same day, they advised us that they asked the cleaning lady and she said she did not see them!!!! And that was it!!!! I certainly do not recommend this hotel. We had previously stayed in other hotels in Paris that are much more decent and for lower prices. Do not book this hotel unless you wish to be robbed!\n",

Our room was typically Parisien, with a small balconey and large modern bathroom. Hotel is \"room only\" package but breakfast can be ordered in from a local bakery if you wish. The \"room only\" deal was fine, just added to the daily meal budget - everything is expensive as you would imagine.The hotel was in a perfect location for the Metro (right outside the hotel) lots of shops and restaurants and 2 minutes walk from the Montparnasse Tower which has an excellent viewing platform of the whole of Paris.We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, arranged the price beforehand with the driver (approx 50 euro) but for our return journey took the train and saved some money ! The Gare Montparnasse was 5 minutes walk away and we had purchased the Navigo Decouverte which gave us acces back to Charles de Gaulle.I would certainly stay here again !\n",

      "  review_body : Looking over the reviews, I can see I'm another voice giving a big thumbs up to the Odessa Hotel. We have stayed here several times and each was a delight. It is very close to the train station and situated in a lively, interesting and safe neighbourhood. This part of Paris is where many artists lived and also had a large community of people from Brittany. Thus on the street beside the hotel there are still four or five restaurants offering Brittany crepes and gallettes which are a favourite of ours before traveling as they are nice and light and delicious. There is also reasonably priced restaurants of every sort in the area, as well as small theatres, cinemas, and interesting shops. This is an area where Parisians live and is not overly touristic. It is great to just sit at the cafe in front of the hotel, and enjoying a coffee or beer and just watch the people go by. Also here is a daily market which sets up just across from the hotel. There seems to be no low-lifes or prostitutes hanging around like in some areas. Other reviews mention, and I agree that the staff and cleanliness of the hotel is first rate. The rooms we have had (end rooms) are quite large by Paris standards with a large bathroom and a huge tub, which allows for a wonderful soak at the end of a long day. The area is not particularly noisy, but it is a big plus that the windows are new and double glazed so it's quiet when they are closed. Don't be afraid by it's two star status. It is better than a lot of three star hotels we have stayed in and is a bargain. It is our home away from home in Paris, and we love staying there.\n",

      "  review_body : Having lived in Paris previously for a number of years, we wanted somewhere lovely to stay with some Parisian flare while still being well connected, and this was just perfect.We stayed in one of the rooms with a balcony (which was a free upgrade for us, thanks) and loved every second of it. Whilst the bathroom felt quite basic, the room and setting as a whole far outweighed this. It was clean, comfortable and enjoyable.The view from the balcony was fantastic looking down into Boulevard Edgar Quinet and towards the Cimetière du Montparnasse. Whilst it is a busy street, the noise added to the flare of Paris (it is a loud city, after all!).We ordered breakfast to the room one morning, which allowed us to enjoy the balcony even more!Connection wise, it could not have been better for us, as we like to explore all over the city. There is a Metro station on Line 6 right under the hotel which can take you directly all the way to the Eifel Tower. Or just a few minutes walk away is the main Montparnasse station which has a whopping 4 metro lines passing through it, literally going in EVERY direction you could possibly want in Paris.Or, if the Metro isn't for you, why not do what we did and just take a nice stroll up towards the Eifel Tower from the hotel and discover some fabulous markets and beautiful buildings on the way?Lastly, we found the reception staff to be friendly, helpful and informative and they even spent some time researching the best markets for us during our stay, so thanks!Really, I can't recommend this lovely hotel enough and we will definitely be staying here again when we return to Paris.Thank you for making it a really great stay.\n",

      "  review_body : The Hotel Marais Home was a wonderful hotel experience. First is the location. Away from tourists, but close to a large metro stop (Republique), and within a short walk of a couple of others. The nearby Republique square is a lively spot, with plenty of restaurants and bakeries to enjoy. Most of the people in the area seemed to be locals, which makes this hotel centered on a truly authentic Parisian neighborhood. You wont find the large tourist attractions outside your door, but we had no problem traversing the city within minutes on the Metro. Second, the hotel itself is simply lovely. The modern decor wraps itself around the older brick interior of the building. The front desk staff, of which we saw at least four (maybe more) different employees working during the week, were very friendly. They all spoke English which is nice for those of us who lack advanced French. They have a beautiful little breakfast area. We encountered two different employees working the area during our stay, both were very nice. The food is pretty good, we ate there every day. There should be something for everyone for breakfast, from croissants and baguettes, to eggs, sausage, cereal, juice, and yogurts. The rooftop terrace was nice to check out, but we stayed up there only briefly. If you look up at night, and look closely, you will notice the spotlight from the Eiffel Tower passing by. Third, the room was modern and charming. We got a two level room with a spiral staircase. It is true that compared to American hotel rooms it is smaller. We liked it even more for that reason. Lack of space makes for a creative room. The bathroom was modern, the bed made for an amazing afternoon nap (after our redeye filght) with soft covers and pillows, and the tub on the upper level made for a relaxing cozy space. Do your trip a favor and stay here. It is not steps away from the tourist traps, but it is steps away from real Paris, and that is what we came to see.\n",

      "  review_body : This is Paris, so an extremely small room in a relatively central hotel, wasn’t entirely unexpected, even for nearly €500 for 3 nights. It smelled distinctly stale on arrival. The bed and pillows were comfortable and clean.Friendly reception staff whenever I spoke with any of them. Roof terrace is small but nice to sit on late afternoon.Basement gym is more focused on lighting and exposed brickwork than any useful equipment. No free-weights or resistance machines. Not worth bothering.The light in the shower began flickering if used for more than a few minutes - not good if you are epileptic! I reported it to the front desk but it wasn’t addressed during my stay.The sink in the bathroom had a musty smell - perhaps due to the overflow being clogged and dirty.The front desk wanted to charge me €10 for an adapter, but after a little coaxing, agreed to loan me one for my 3 nights, which I returned. Couldn’t find an English language tv channel. First 20 were all French and there was no guide in the room, so I gave up. There is a small kettle, with 2 tea bags and 2 mills. No coffee. Nothing was replenished during my stay.\n",

      "  review_body : Yes, as others have pointed out, the rooms here are small. But I challenge you to find a centrally located, reasonably priced hotel anywhere in Paris where this is not the case. So having gotten that out of the way, this is a great option in Paris. It's within walking distance of tons of Marais restaurants & cafes and within very easy walking distance of a major metro hub, from where you can easily get to all the major sights. The rooms are modern & clean, the beds & pillows are comfortable. All of the staff we encountered were friendly & helpful. With all the great pastry shops in the area we didn't bother to try the breakfast. WiFi was weak at best, so that's the one area of improvement I would suggest. Otherwise, a great stay, we would not hesitate to go back.\n",

The room is small and we struggled to get our four cases in as we were travelling down to Antibes afterwards. It is doable though and they state the room sizes clearly on their website. The hotel is placed close to a Metro station and is only 20-25 mins walk to the Seine. The room was comfortable and looked recently refurbished. The staff were excellent, from the front desk to the ladies serving breakfast, which was also a pleasurable experience.\n",

There are a bunch of fantastic Boulangerie nearby - Aux Péchés Normandes and Boulangerie Utopie were two of our favorites. Two of the best craft cocktail bars, Le Mary Celeste and Little Red Door, are a stone's throw from its front door. Also, a pharmacie, a bank, a post office, two Wild & The Moons (vegan spot), wonderful bistrot and cafes, The Fringe Coffee, and more. You can easily walk to the shopping district near the Musée Pablo Picasso and National Archives. The room was very cozy, and most importantly for us, had both windows and A/C. The ventilation and temperature control were really comforting after a long day hiking hundreds of Eiffel/Montmartre/Arc stairs. We didn't partake in any of the amenities - but they have a rooftop for champagne drinking, a breakfast bar, a lounge, a sauna, and English-speaking staff. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!But I don’t know if it would be good for families, as the room was pretty small and the elevators are really slim. \n",

      "  review_body : We chose Hotel Marais based on TA reviews and the location, since we felt comfortable with the neighborhood. It was a terrific choice, and will be our \"go to\" hotel when we visit Paris in the future. Don't be put off by the small appearance on the street: the hotel is warm, modern, and lovely inside. We can't say enough about the hotel manager who was so gracious and who spoke perfect English (and I suspect several other languages in addition to French). Our room was small but immaculate, in the back on the ground floor, which was fine for stay. The bathroom is the ultimate in efficiency, but it has a lovely overhead shower head, lots of warm water, and fluffy towels. Breakfast is served downstairs in a room that was lit with scores of eccentric light fixtures which caused it to glow in a friendly way. This was among the best French breakfasts we've had, with all the normal fresh bread, but also scrambled eggs and sausages.Two metro stops are within 100M of the front door, and from Republique, you can get all over the metro system, including Gare du Nord (three stops) and from there to Charles de Gaulle airport. Highly recommended.\n",

      "  review_body : The description of the hotel is very misleading as in provides an extensive list for spa treatments. We booked a massage for each as well as facials. Much confusion as to what was being done. Facials, as it turned out, were not an option. (although there is a door labeled Esthetician) The massage room was cold and below average and it seemed they called in some random guy for the massage. At one point his face was within inches of my mouth and nose and I actually had to time my breaths to avoid inhaling as he exhaled. I did get quite sick with a cold a couple days later, but can't say it was from him. The hammam was a joke and the area smelled of body odor. The room was beyond small..the bed was inches from the wall on one side - although the bathroom was nice. Having said all that - the people at the front desk were amazing. Upbeat - helpful - went the extra mile. Can't say enough great things about them. The location was excellent. Able to walk everywhere - even lost 5 pounds! A nice selection for breakfast and the dining area had old world charm . The work-out room also had charm, but was cold - and the television did not work. (No batteries in the remote) The pillows and bed were comfortable. Housekeeping was hit or miss. Would not stay there again as rooms just too small for comfort and would like to have actual spa facilities. Interestingly enough - we were not told anything about a rooftop terrace. \n",

The breakfast was also great. Good location too!. Would I ever stay there again? Probably not. The room was impossibly small to navigate around the bed. It was tiny. There was no room to store suitcases-suppose we could have emptied them all and had suitcases stored somewhere? Really? Housekeeping forgot to remove and provide clean towels one of the nights and left the toilet paper roll empty. Really dissappointing part was the the hotel does not have a full service spa as advertised. When we got there the lights were off, the heat was not on, there are no lockers or other amenities or any other guests. The spa facilities were underwhelming. But......the staff was so totally amazing and the price reasonable. I have to go with 3 stars.\n",

      "  review_body : Given the high caliber of other boutique hotels we stayed during our week in Europe, my expectations for Marais Home were probably artificially inflated. Most guests will find the hotel's excellent location, the helpful staff, the cleanliness, the variety of options in the breakfast buffet, and the surrounding neighborhood all top notch. I did, and I'll admit that my complaints are somewhat nitpicky and largely out of the hotel's control. Still, I strive for balanced reviews. Of concern: A window that wouldn't close properly resulting in traffic noise 24/7, a room so small that there was no place but the bathroom to put our luggage, and only one usable electrical outlet for charging that had to be shared with the room's lamp and coffee machine. Who knows... A different room in the same property may have made a huge difference. (Small aside: It is obvious that this property did not start life as a hotel, and the room configurations seem to betray this fact.) Final verdict: Nice, but not hypable.\n",

      "  review_body : I had been going back and forth for months on where to stay and was absolutely delighted that we made the right choice. The location is supreme, literally a block and a half from the Republique metro stop with many restaurants and boulangeries close by. It was even more convenient when after several days of traveling I could literally cross the street and wash a load of clothes. The hotel is small and has so much character. The staff was attentive and responsive to all our needs and requests. Our intent was to use the steam room nightly, but we were side tracked by other activities. We did use the steam room for one evening and it was absolutely a treat and I highly recommend. I had read many reviews on Paris hotels and saw that leaving the key at reception when leaving is necessary, honestly it didn't seem such a big deal. The area is busy and has lots of activity. We heard music and sirens but it didn't bother us terribly. We did go one evening to the rooftop lounge area and enjoyed Mimosas. It did seem like they cleaned the rooms later on in the day which could be a thing if you come back from your activities and the room hasn't been completed. Anyhow, all in all our stay was fantastic.. I would easily choose this hotel again!\n",

Another receptionist got pretty.. “snippy” about us leaving without giving the key to them.We were unfortunate enough to get a room with the windows facing out into a “back yard”/smoking area. And at night when people came home from the bars, it got pretty loud. We were not able to sleep with the windows open, cause then it would be filled with smoke from people outside.We tried the SPA-facilities. Or at least the sauna and steam room. Which was great! They even called to our room when the sauna was ready before it was “our time”. Breakfast was alright. Not the best, but what do you expect when it’s already included in the price. The hotel itself was close to the metro, grocery stores and pharmacies. Which was great! It wasn’t in the busiest street, so it was mostly nice and quiet.\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel works for me partly because it is in the neighborhood where my friend lives. But forget that, it's an excellent location for anybody. Near the 12 Metro and lots of buses you are are also practically next door to a patisserie with one of the best baguettes in Paris (as well as delicious everything else), close to more than one cheese shop, foie gras store, lots of cafes, and walking distance to excellent restaurants. You're a couple of blocks up Blomet from one of the best night-time looks at the sparkling Tour Eiffel. There's a twice-a-week morning food market close by on Convention and you can walk over to Commerce for shopping and more cafes. The park Lambert is a treat in all seasons. Vaugirard offers shopping too and the Monoprix on Vaugirard is a really good one. As for the hotel, it's excellent. Staff is pleasant, lobby is comfortable. Our room was tiny but well done - in truth, really a room for one because storage space is minimal (really minimal). There are ways they could improve the storage and hopefully they will. Bathroom is very good. The bed and pillows were great (and it's rare, in my experience, to get good pillows). We tried breakfast once and it was only okay. We did use both the pool and the exercise room - they are really a bonus to have at a small hotel. \n",

      "  review_body : Where to start... Beautiful, elegant, classy hotel in a great part of Paris, not too far from the Eiffel Tower with many restaurants close by. We received a very warm welcome by the receptionist who spoke perfect English. After checking in our details, we took the spacious lift to our floor - we were in Room 106 which faced out on the front (very quiet street). It was very well air-conditioned, with double-glazed windows if fresh air were required. The room had statement, soft carpet and was furnished with beautiful contemporary rosewood cupboards which hid a mini-bar, a Nespresso coffee pod, a variety of Kusmi teas, a safe, cut glass tumblers, a proper hair dryer and a lighted wardrobe. The bed was a Superking, with a real leather, duck egg blue headboard, beautiful velvety-soft sheets and wonderful pillows. The mattress also had a lovely mattress topper, so sliding into bed was fabulous. In the corner of the room was a small circular table, with a chair and a solid rosewood stool. Facing the bed was a huge wall-mounted Samsung TV. The room lighting was excellent, with spots everywhere and tiny but powerful halogen pencil-shaped reading lights on each side of the bed. The showerroom was fully tiled with a white suite, black and white tiled walls and floor, a large quadrant shower with a drench shower head and a separate body shower. There were towelling robes and slippers, Nuxe toiletries including shampoo, body wash, conditioner and body lotion. There was plenty of hot water. The toilet was a good \"flusher\". We slept like logs in the beautiful bed after returning from dinner with our daughter and son-in-law. Next morning, check-out was a very civilised 12 o'clock. This left time for the best breakfast we have had in Paris for a long time! Breakfast was attractively presented on a buffet in the dining room. The hot choice included scrambled eggs, streaky bacon, sausages and boiled eggs. There was fresh fruit salad, organic yogurts in little glass jars, several cereals, freshly squeezed orange, pink grapefruit, pineapple and apple juices, divine croissants, plump pain au chocolate, olive-oil type baguettes, butter, honey, Nutella and various jams. There was also a toaster, sliced brioche, ordinary toasting bread, biscuits. The cold selection included very tender Prosciutto ham, roast ham, chicken breast, Milano salami, Chèvre goat cheese, Cantal, cream cheese and a mild sliced cheese. There was a Nespresso coffee machine producing wonderful coffees, Kusmi teas, chocolate, water, milk. Is your mouth watering yet? The staff are lovely - nothing is too much trouble - someone came immediately to our room after we rang to say our TV remote was dead. Breakfast staff are friendly and helpful and do not hurry you to eat up and move on. There is a wonderful lounge on the ground floor with a proper fireplace, multi-language newspapers, magazines and an honesty bar with a good selection of drinks. In the basement is a swimming pool, gym, hamman and sauna, although we had no time to visit these facilities. All in all - an exceptional hotel in the heart of Paris. I can't wait to stay again!\n",

Reasonable size pool - very relaxing luxury feel open from 7am to 945pm. The hotel staff are very helpful . Not far from metro . No restaurant late at night but you can always order Uber eats from Pizza Hut nearby . I choose a suite with a balcony overlooking the courtyard . I also saw a smaller room with a balcony facing the street - with hindsight the standard room with view if the street would have been better for me as I like to see some hustle and bustle . Breakfast is missing favourites of UK and US customers ie no baked beans or hash browns or fried eggs or pancakes. There are juices , sausages , bacon , cheeses , yoghurt, fruit , a variety of pastries with a supply of Nutella to keep kids happy and scrambled and boiled eggs with a selection of cereals .I liked the hotel and my teenage daughter loved the pool .

      "  review_body : Ok, so you can't actually see the Eiffel tower from the hotel, but it's an easy walk. This hotel completely exceeded my expectations in terms of value, comfort, and location. Staff had no trouble finding my reservation at check-in, and check-out was a breeze. My queen room was small by American standards but typical for Paris. The bed comfortable and pleasantly plush (way better than the average European bed in my experience), pillows plentiful, and linens soft and inviting. A big window let in lots of light during the day (though the view is of another building across the street, so nothing special) but the curtains blocked everything out for a great sleep. Shower was beautiful with an overhead rainfall and a handheld head. Toiletries were top quality. Wifi was fast and consistent. Pool, sauna, and steam room were spotless. Hours are a little short if you are an early riser or you get back late from a day exploring Paris, but really at this price point and this prime location, the fact that they have these amenities at all is incredible.  The only downside is that it is a little tricky to get to CDG or Orly airport from here. Expect to pay 40-60 euro for a taxi/ride share. I would stay again without hesitation.\n",

There was also an honestly bar for your evening enjoyment. The room was comfortable with a wonderful shower (loved it). Great staff who helped us schedule a dinner cruise for our anniversary.\n",

      "  review_body : We found this hotel through Booking.com. I had originally looked for Airbnb- but they were difficult to find in Paris. This hotel is definitely on the higher end. First the location: within easy walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. I would definitely recommend taking a cab from the airport (flat fee of 55 euro), otherwise you will need to find the RER and then change to two different metro lines and then walk, all the while carrying your luggage. There is a convenient Metro stop down the block and around the corner: Vaugirard. If you are thinking of riding the metro around Paris, it is better to buy a \"book\" of ten tickets- it's cheaper). The Metro is excellent and well organized. If you ride the Metro you will often need to turn the knob on the door of the train counterclockwise as doors don't always open automatically. (for you ladies, there is a wonderful dress shop across the street- your hubby can go to the park nearby and sit while you shop... just saying).Back to the hotel: Excellent neighborhood. Great amenities. Larger size rooms comparably to others in Paris. Wonderfully clean, great bath products. We did not take advantage of the pool. Great breakfast (we paid ahead of time- 18 euros- yes,it's a bit pricey but we usually like a good breakfast to start the day, minimize at lunch and then eat a good dinner. Beware- Parisians eat late (places don't start filling up until 8:30 and then kick into full swing by nine). I researched ahead of time and found L'Artisans- lovely place to eat!\n",

Breakfast - we paid extra - was plentiful and good. The rates were excellent for Paris and yes, it was so quiet.It was farther out than I had originally wanted, but we are so glad we chose to stay here anyway. It is close to Metro stations on 2 different lines and about a half hour walk to the Eiffel Tower. It is only about a 10 minute walk (without luggage) to the Gare Montparnasse, which was very handy for our trip to Chartres. We found it quite convenient.But our very favorite thing was the neighborhood. This is a real neighborhood - probably upper middle class. Most evenings we walked around the corner and joined everyone to buy bread at the boulangerie and fresh cherries at the produce shop. What a treat and so fun to feel a part of a true Parisian neighborhood.\n",

We went straight to our hotel, they held our bags for us while we explored the city. The room was ready just as we arrived back at 3pm. We booked a room with a full size bed and a sofa bed. The room size was nice and spacious. It is one of the larger rooms available at this hotel compared to rooms with only a bed.We had a view of the river and the boats. The room was directly above one of the restaurants that is located along the bottom floor. You could hear the noice from them but we were so exhausted from traveling it did not bother us. Just after we arrived we needed assistance with a few issues in the room. There was no extra bedding and for some reason the phone system did not work. We called and they came up immediately.The breakfast they offer is perfect to fill your belly before going to exploring the city. My favorite item they offered was toast and nutella. There is a bar next to the check-in desk but that was not utilized by many guest. The area was more used for guest to have meetings.The Area:The hotel location was next to a youth hostel and an American Bar. Making this area a fan for the younger age crowd. We found places to eat every evening within a few blocks of the hotel. One night we had Pho and another night we had McDonald's. There is plenty of options. The hotel is about 3 to 4 blocks from a metro station that will bring you to the heart of paris. If we go back, I would stay at this location again.\n",

      "  review_body : Look at my other reviews - I do not award one star lightly. In this case, it is fully deserved. This used to be a good hotel. However, this time, accompanied by my wife, we tried to resolve a room challenge and were met with the most unbelievably aggressive attitude from one Duty Manager in particular. He came looking for a fight.In general, the staff is unwilling/unable to work with guests to look for compromise and reach a mutually beneficial solution. This results in a 'do not care' attitude.I visited this hotel when it first opened and complimented the staff on their attitudes - noting that it is hard to find such positive attitudes in Paris hotels. I asked that they keep these good attitudes and hive level of customer care. This has not happened.\n",

      "  review_body : The hotel is located on the banks of a canal and is near two metro stations (Crimée and Laumière , which is only a few stops away from Gare du Nord). We were able to get to all the major tourist attractions within half an hour using the metro. The surrounding area isn’t very touristy but we found it safe and there are a few good restaurants nearby - i recommend the the Italian restaurant, Simonetta, on the other side of the canal.We found the hotel staff to be very helpful. Our room was a decent size and our beds were really comfortable. We had a good night’s sleep every night.The breakfast buffet has a decent range of food (mainly continental) and drinks, although the cereals tasted awful and at times they ran out essential items such as English breakfast tea bags. Would stay here again. \n",

      "  review_body : Reading reviews and being a holiday inn member I thought this place looks good a little off the central area but close enough to public transportation. We got in around 10am check in person was super nice stated cant check in until 3pm but we could store our bags. That was great we checked out Paris since like others mentioned 2 train station close by. Came back at 4pm as it was raining to check in first lady super nice asked if I want a drink or extra points. Then she gave me a little basket for being a member I pulled 1,000 extra points still havent received them. She then asked another lady to get our bags I gave her the slips we got for checking our bags. At first she could find them then asked for colors mine were easy purple and red backpacks but my spouse 2 grey roll backs they tryed to give him other people bags twice he said there not his. I dont understand why give slips with numbers if this isn't used. Finally after 3 attempts he got his bags. We got to our room nice and big for European standards. I like our view of the canal even with the rain wished we could sit out there. The hotel even had a nice little surprise for my spouse birthday. What was odd no safe which was scary thank goodness we were only here one night. We got showered, unpacked, reorganized a bit changed from our wet clothes and head back out for the night. When we got back around midnight we noticed an issue on our sheets. I went straight down to the front desk the young man name started with an L super friendly and new to this place apologized and got us new sheets. Never had an incident like this happen. We slept well bed super comfortable. Anyways next morning woke up had breakfest. I did like this breakfest with the deli meats and cheeses but it was hard to get a table. We were sat and then someone took our table. We found another but its odd they seat you and people just sit themselves. Also the hot food was extra from what was written which was odd and things did not get replaced right away or they ran out of things at 9am. At checkout I mentioned what happened when we got back to our room they got the manager who seemed to say I dont know how that happened I was in the room checking on things. Check out was fine overall just left a bad taste in my mouth that I felt the manger was blaming us for our sheets. Either way liked I stated really wanted to love this place but cant say I stay here again a bit off from attractions. Also at night when you walk back you will smell urine all around this area. Good for one night great price. Lovely looking canal most staff super friendly. Just things to be cautious of. \n",

At the time of checkout (3 days later) I was handed over an excel sheet (attached as a proof) showing room access logs since technician was also not available (enough time to make changes in). On this such a serious complaint Hotel staff sending rude response which I am shocked to see.

Not exactly central but acceptable \"commute\" in my opinion.We stayed during Paris Plage so loads going on around the hotel with open air bars on both sides of the canal.A few previous reviews raised concerns over the safety of the location.

I’m in a wheelchair. The room had a wet room shower. The toilet is the same height as my wheelchair, so very helpful. I was given a shower seat which hooks on to the grab rail. The seat was very solid, but no arm rests, and height was much lower than my wheelchair.Wheelchair accessibility was fantastic. The only slight drawback, was the fact that the toilet only had one fixed grab rail. It would’ve been fantastic to have two drop down grab rails. If the toilet had a back rest, that would’ve been fantastic too. I managed to use the facilities, nevertheless, but the added features would’ve been really fabulous.Overall, the hotel was very clean. The breakfast was very good. The hotel is within easy reach of restaurants, bars, and cafes. An excellent stay, all in all...Thank you,Lee from Gravesend Kent England.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here from May 25th to June 1st, 2019. The area where the hotel is located is a nice canal with close proximity to both the Riquet and Stalingrad metro lines. In travelling the world, one thing we appreciate are rooms with safes in it. For some reason this is an amenity that's left out in the rooms of this hotel. We also ran into a situation that needed us to call Canada to deal with (pickpocketed on the metro). There was no in room instructions on how to make a long distance call, and when we went to the front desk, no one there seemed to know at the time how to make a call to Canada. Very frustrating. I wound up contacting who I needed to via facebook messenger. The included breakfast was ok.. Once they offered apple turnovers but once that one batch was gone... they were gone. If you're travelling to Paris for tourism and pleasure, you won't be spending much time in the room. There's lots of restuarants, brasseries and other amenities within walking distance. The Riquet metro line takes you directly to the Louvre museum. I've stayed at a few Holiday Inn expresses in North American and the UK, and given the fact this was Paris, I just found it average overall. Location was great for seeing Paris and access to the Metro and transit. But the lack of an in room safe was really off putting to me, which led to me carrying stuff around with me around Paris I normally wouldn't have. \n",

I don't know if this is a French custom (the LOUVRE didn't have AC!) but heading to the hotel, the Uber driver didn't use AC either, just the windows were open. Luckily it's Spring with cool nights and the windows were able to open.Second complaint is that at breakfast, even at 9:30am (they close at 10) was pretty full. Since I was by myself, they wouldn't seat me as they only had tables for four. The ones for two were all used. So they suggested I get my food and take it to the bar across the way.Other than that, this is a fairly nice hotel. The room was clean and a decent size.

The room is small but enough, we got the one facing the canal de seine, it is a better view than if you got the opposite rooms. the breakfast served was the same for 3 days so i kinda regretted availing it. Canal de seine is nice to walk along anytime of the day, there are a lot of homeless hanging around but i didn't see anyone bothering other people. it seems that the area is on a multicultural area as there are a lot of middle easterns, africans, asians aside from the old parisians. they brought along their cuisines as well in their respective restaurants. So you can have anything you want there right outside. you can also rent electric boats in the canal. This hotel is nice if you get past the homeless people hanging around town.\n",

Had been made up for 2, so only 2 towels & cups, collected additional when we returned in the evening. The view was of the canal. Everything was clean, except for the carpet which was pretty grubby. Room had hairdryer, kettle and small selection of tea & coffee.Breakfast was good, with a selection of cereals, fruit, breads, cold meats, cheese & pastries, sausages, bacon and scrambled eggs, juices and a good selection of hot drinks.There are several metro stations nearby, a few supermarkets and restaurants. Rue de Meaux nearby has a variety of restaurants and bars. The walk along the canal into Paris is very picturesque. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but all I encountered were polite. I would stay again.\n",

      "  review_body : Location- loved it. Off the beaten path for first time Paris visitors but nice to walk around in a more residential area. Lots of little restaurants and bars and very close to subway line.Room- I wish we had asked to be moved on first day of our 7 day trip. Had a top floor room. Size was nice with one large bed and a sofabed. Two major problems- Worst stained carpet I've seen and odors (two totally different types). When we walked in room and saw stains on carpet I thought they had just shampooed since it was very discolored in most places. I never thought a Holiday Inn would put someone in a room with that carpeting. Also since it was raining out I thought maybe the previous guest or housekeeper tracked water in from the balcony. We unpacked and went out for the day. The next morning it was evident that this was just a terribly stained carpet. If this room was acceptable to them then the others were probably the same I thought.The room also had either a VERY strong cleaning smell or on the last 2-3 days was a terrible sewer smell from the bathroom. We had to keep bathroom door shut so we could tolerate it in the bedroom. Neighbors had the same odor issue.The restaurant breakfast was decent. No changes throughout our 7 days but didn't bother us too much.Front desk nice enough. Never said hello or any acknowledgment when we walked by the desk a few times a day. It would have been nice.Will we return? Probably not. I expect better quality of the room.\n",

Had a few things been better I would have given 5 stars. No food was being served for at least 3 nights of my stay. Had the hotel served food they would have been rushed off their feet as lots of places were closed. The main issue is with the decor, it's quite tatty and needs updating in areas.

      "  review_body : The nearest metro is Riquet and it is actually quite far (around ten stops) from the central part of Paris. But that is good because it is further from the hustle and bustle of the city. The neighbourhood the hotel is situated at is very quiet and yet full of life. The canal also provides a very nice and tranquil view. During the second weekend of the riots, I explored around the area and enjoyed my evening thoroughly there. People were seen playing ping pong, pétanque and drinking on some the boats in the canal. There are two cinema halls on both sides of the canal further down from the hotel. The hotel serves good decent breakfast. Most of the staff, especially the ladies, are very helpful and warm.There is an iMac and printer at a corner behind the lifts which you can print out your tour vouchers and tickets. Most agencies in Paris prefer the paper documents so this service at the hotel comes in handy. However, the instructions are in French. Do ask for assistance if you know very little French like me.I have seen this many times when I was there. New tourists do not know that the room card is needed to activate the lift to go to your floor. And if I am not wrong, if two riders are going to different floors, they should each tap and press the respectively floor button. Or else, the one who did not tap cannot go to his floor. This is good so that we do not have uninvited strangers wondering around. However, speaking of security measures, it may be good to ask any food delivery to leave the food at reception for collection. I had a pizza guy knocking on my door one night, insisting that I ordered pizzas. I had to open the door to see the delivery order. The order did state my room number but I don't even eat pizza and I was alone. I could not finish one whole pizza by myself at night. I just wondered if the pizza guy was a little not understanding and I was alone in my room, could he get aggressive and would there be any immediate assistance? And how did he have the access to my room with a room key?Perhaps it will be good for the hotel to insist that hotel customers to come down to reception to collect any food order. It sounds troublesome but definitely an option to consider. For Asian people who crave for rice and oriental food, there is a sushi restaurant right opposite the hotel. For people who like to do their own laundry, there is a laundromat shortly after you cross the bridge behind the hotel. There is one along the way to Riquet station but I prefer this one. There is a franprix nearby where I can use some free wifi while waiting to collect my clean laundry. And of course to buy some food and beverages back to my hotel room.All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel thoroughly.\n",

The surrounding is very nice, being in a very modest area of Paris. On weekends, you can actually see the locals socialising near the canal and witness the Parisian life and this is what makes the hotel an attractive destination. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the breakfast as you get a whole lot of different things on the buffet, including cheese, pastries, yogurt, and bread.

We also appreciated that there were several nice restaurants quite close (2 within less than 50 meters across the street), and the area is quite busy, so we felt very safe going out for dinner. Although this hotel seems a bit far from the main tourist areas, it was a short walk to the nearest metro station, Riquet, which took us easily to the sights we wanted to visit.

The hotel was in a residential neighborhood with apartments, bistrots, cafés. You could tell this was a diverse neighborhood, people were riding bikes, walking their dogs, or playing Pétanque in the small parc. We loved sitting down on benches to watch the boats on the canal. The metro Riquet was a 5minutes walk from the hotel and it was easy to transfer to go to the city center of Paris.The hotel room and bathroom was average but clean. We had internet access but it was so slowwww.... The hotel offfered free breakfast in the morning with a surprisingly good variety of breakfast items and meats. My son especially enjoyed the croissants and we saved money because breakfast was free!I don’t remember if they had a gym to use. But it did not make any difference to us since we walked so much during the day and came to the hotel late at night too tired to do anything else after a long day of sight seeing. I figured with all that walking, who needed the gym?The hotel was not luxurious... but that was not what I was paying for. All in all I got a good value for my hotel stay. The cherry on top was I got to stay at a hotel very close to the Seine river!\n",

      "  review_body : I am currently staying here in one of their junior suites with family (411). this property is fantastic. its located quite close to the Arc, very well connected to all major sites through metro or even walking.the people at reception are very helpful and smiling. Nothing is difficult for them and that is a wonderful thing. we did not have breakfast so cannot comment but this place is very close to good restaurants, bars, cafes so eating is never a problem.the rooms are fabulous, get immaculately cleaned everyday and Jr suites come with a coffee machine which is a life saver.they give you a smart phone which can be used across Paris. Netflix is amazing and is a great choiceI happen to visit Paris quite a lot and was confused if I should stay near Eiffel or Arc but i guess this hotel is where I would be coming everytime.Just 1 issue though, there is come construction happening right next to our room so in the morning theres a lot of noise but its not much of a dampenerOverall, its a fab hotel at a fab location and is relatively well priced. Keep up the good work guys!\n",

      "  review_body : Hotel room is clean, nice beds, air doesn’t really cool like it should, WiFi at hotel works fine, their connection to make free calls or use WiFi outside the hotel and does not stream to the TV as advertised. Let me say about the staff has NO clue how to fix it. You can ask for assistance and the response is. Let me call the technician. The technician doesn’t show up or do they follow up. For the air. It does cool down the temp you can turn it too. Granted I’m not dying but cold showers are required. They seem to have one person working the reception desk at a time. They are trying to do check in’s plus all the other Duties. Has the potential to be a top place to stay. Need a bit more staff to be working. The lady that works during the day did help us on directions and such. So she tried. Thank goodness I called ATT for a international package or I couldn’t check in with family, friends and work. I would give it a poor rating at this point.\n",

      "  review_body : My wife, two daughters (16 and 14 years old), and I selected the Hotel Magda Champs Elysees for its proximity to the Arc de Triomphe and access to Metro and RER lines (via Charles de Gaulle Etoile Station). Whilst the property rated highly for its convenience to major Paris tourist attractions, it also delivered in terms of quality. The room was surprisingly spacious for a Parisian hotel and earned high marks for cleanliness and comfort. It passed a simple test... if asked if we would stay there again, the response would be a hearty yes. The only \"deductions\" from a top rating were the musty smell and old, traditional European bath tub / shower combination. The former point was easily remedied by opening the windows whilst the latter could be addressed with a renovation of the bathroom (which in general was outdated). Consider these points minor in the overall context of this review. If you are looking to stay near the Champs Elysees / Arc de Triomphe, consider the Hotel Magda. It won't disappoint.\n",

The room size was pretty typical for a Paris hotel. Everything was very clean and well maintained. As an added bonus, the provided a mobile phone essentially that you could connect to as a hotspot and take it around the city with you. It was nice having the connection to google, buy tickets, etc. Overall, I’d recommend this hotel! Staff was very friendly. The location is fantastic and it was clean. \n",

      "  review_body : Really and truly right around the corner from the Champs Elysees. Excellent location near a landmark of course, but also near several metro entrances. There's a burger king and a mcdonald's at the end of the street if you're looking for a late night snack. Once you enter to your right will be the dining area for breakfast and to the left will be the check-in counter. There are two gentlemen who man the desk, but only one at a time. The night gentleman is more personable and chatty but both are incredibly nice and helpful. I bothered them a lot because my baggage had been delayed and they were very gracious and helpful. After checking in, directly across from the main entrance is a lovely winding staircase. To the left of the staircase is a small elevator. I wouldn't think the elevator could fit more than 2 people, and definitely not if you have significant luggage. I felt very roomy since I had just a carry-on and myself but if you're a two or more person party I would take turns going up the elevator. It's not a very quick or grandiose one but it does the job and is very clean. The staircase is a little squeaky and if you're on the top floor like I was you'll get a workout but the winding aspect does make it very fun. I had one of the smallest rooms I believe with just a single bed - it was wider I feel than a regular twin bed, but of course not as wide as a full or a queen. Once you walk in there's a bathroom to your right, the bed further ahead and to your right. On the left wall there's a small desk area. Directly ahead there is a window which can be opened with the classic iron railing and you can look up and down the street if you poke your head out - there aren't any landmarks or anything visible but personally I felt it was a lovely view since all the architecture was different from what I'm used to. The bedding was pristine and very comfortable and the receptionist gave me extra blankets as requested free of charge. When you're laying on the bed, to the left is a little cubby cut into a closet where there is a phone and a place to charge your phone. The closet is maybe 2 feet wide and has a safe in it which is very easy to set up. Under the safe is also a small refrigerator with assorted drinks. On the small table are various snacks but most importantly a portable wifi hotspot which would have been very useful had I not already purchased data w/ my carrier. The bathroom is also very small - you're getting the idea, everything is small. But everything is also very clean! Once you enter the bathroom to the right is the sink, and to the front right is the standing shower and front left is the toilet. To your left on the wall is a hook for hanging your towels and to the right on the wall is a hair dryer. The toiletries were strange, there was body wash and solid soap and body lotion but no conditioner or shampoo. The doors to the shower stall are double sided and open up in a v-shaped fashion. You can change the water to come from above or from a hand-held which was nice. There didn't seem to be any limits on how long the hot water lasted. There isn't a lot of space to put all the toiletries you've brought w/ you.\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is located near the Arc de Triomphe. When we arrived the first night the room was stifling. We called the front desk and he said that there's nothing we can do about it but open the window. There was no reason for it to be so hot since the temperature outside was in the high 50s early 60s during the daytime.There was so many loud noises in the morning with the window opened (there was construction happening right outside) and we were awakened very early. The heat was off and they didnt have the option of turning on the ac (they said its central and they only could turn it on in the summer). It was very bizarre that it was so hot with the heat off. After the third night, the person at the front desk was very nice and switched our room. Unfortunately, it was only a bit cooler than the other room and we didnt sleep well. I dont necessarily recommend this hotel, unless you visit in the summer months when there's ac. The staff are friendly and the room decor very nice.\n",

      "  review_body : My extended family had planned a first time vacation to Paris. We were going to and from different places. Orignally, I had booked a different, lower cost hotel with comparable amenities. However, the other hotel did not provide shuttle services to/from the airport.At the suggestion of my family, I booked Hotel Magda since their website stated they will help arrange for shuttle service and we had already booked Hotel Magda for a return to Paris later in the week. I had booked reservations for 3 deluxe suites and 1 junior suite. The cost of the 4 rooms was double that of my previous hotel reservation elsewhere. This was, after all, the first time we had been in Paris and not having to worry about transportation to the hotel was one less thing to worry about. So we booked this hotel...I had emailed back and forth with the hotel regarding the shuttle service. I was informed a week before we arrived, that service was prepared for us.Upon arrival at Charles de Gaulle Airport, there was no shuttle to be found. I contacted the hotel and was told that shuttle service was supposed to meet us there. I called again and was asked for confirmation numbers that I was not given in my email correspondences with the hotel. After an hour of waiting and calling the hotel back and forth, my family ended up taking Ubers to get to the hotel.When we got to the hotel, the staff was very apologetic... however, when it came time to check in, they didn't have the rooms I reserved. They had 2 deluxe suites and 2 junior suites. I asked the front desk staff to check my reservation and they admitted there was an error on the hotel's side. The hotel was already fully booked and they could not give us all the rooms we reserved. I was disappointed to say the least. But we took what we could because we did not have another option.When we checked out, I asked that the charges be adjusted for the lesser room. Unfortnately, that did not happen. I was charged for the 3 deluxe and 1 junior suite. I said that it needed to be corrected and that the hotel manager should contact me. I left my email and phone number. I did not get any call back nor an email.Later in the week, my family returned to Paris and since we already had prior reservations here, it was too late to change the reservation and find another hotel...Upon our arrival, I expressed my displeasure that the hotel management did not contact me regarding the erroneous charges. I was asked to email the hotel regarding their error. I do not think it is my responsibility to email the hotel to start correcting their charges. I informed the front desk staff and they in turn informed management. That should have been enough.When we arrived, our rooms were actually ready. However, the room I was given did not have a working bathroom light. We went to the front desk and the British woman at the desk said she couldn't get someone to fix the light until 2 days later. This was unacceptable, she wanted us to stay in a room without a working bathroom light! We asked for another room and after another staff member took over, we received the same room we had stayed in earlier in the week. However, it smelled like cigarettes... we expressed our concern and I was asked again to email the management...Other than the British woman at the front desk, the hotel staff we interacted with were very nice. I hope I spell their names correctly, but Ziana, Bobakar and Elwin (Elwin was the best) were very good to us. They understood our frustrations and tried to make things right. Elwin especially went out of his way to help us get what we needed.From what I understand, this hotel was bought out after we made our reservations and the owner and staff were not the ones who we had initial contact with via email. I would give a little leeway for the change in staff. However, management should have gotten back to me to correct the charges. Instead, I am now dealing with my credit card company to investigate the incorrect charges...This hotel is close to some good shopping but other hotels are close to other city attractions. also, there are other hotels out there that charge less for the same or better rooms. As of this review, I have not heard from the hotel management regarding the incorrect charges...I wonder if my experience would have been better with the previous owner and staff. They got good reviews...\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is a little hidden gem. Literally a 1 minute walk from the arc de triomphe and Champs-Elysées. When we arrived we had a quick check in and went off to our room. Our room was one of the larger rooms. It had a small kitchenette (without a stove) which was handy, it also came equipped with a nespresso coffee machine. The rooms were very spacious and each had a tv. We had a lot of luggage with us and didn’t struggle to store it. The bathroom had a bathtub and shower and was also very spacious and most importantly the rooms and bathroom was very clean. The staff here and very polite, courteous, friendly and the most helpful. We arrived to the same afternoon the rioters destroyed the Champs-Elysées, so were advised by the staff not to leave the hotel as we had children and there was gas/pepper spray in the air. One member of staff kindly escorted my husband somewhere local where he could purchase hot food for us to eat back at the hotel. The hotel has a seating area in lobby where you can drink tea and coffee for free, there is also a little self service bar which comes at a charge. As well as the hotel being in a great location, at the end of the street there are plenty of French cafes, various restaurants (French, Thai, Chinese), a Mac Donald’s and Starbucks. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others. The only reason I haven’t given 5 stars is because of the lack of food services and what was on offer for breakfast was very limited.\n",

This phone doubled as an internet hot spot and a Netflix streamer to our tv. I've never seen such a thoughtful item in a room. A metro stop was just feet away so traveling around was very easy. Breakfast and an honor bar is available in the lobby area. The real jewel of the hotel is Allyson, she is in command of the front desk. She answered ever question and accommodated all our needs.

It is also a 2 minute walk to the metro station with lots of places to eat nearby. I felt very safe walking around the area late at night. The hotel room was much bigger than anticipated and our room (a double) had every amenity we needed including dark curtains that kept the room dark in the early am, a small fridge, a powerful hair dryer, a retractable clothes line in the shower, hooks for hanging our toiletry bags, etc. Our room had a balcony facing the street and it was lovely to wake up and look out into a traditional Parisian street.Staff was great and fluent in English. Breakfast was not included but we purchased it the day we were leaving and while pricey (about 16€) it was varied and filling. I would definitely stay at this hotel again without hesitation.\n",

The location is great, a short walk from the well-connected Charles de Gaulle-Etoille metro stop, Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. We loved roaming around discovering wonderful little cafes and window-shopping.The staff is warm, friendly, speak English and are very helpful. The neighborhood has all kinds of dining options. The junior suite we had was spacious, with tons of closet space, roomy bathroom, fridge, microwave and sink. An awesome perk is the complementary smartphone with hotspot, so you can have wifi as you travel!If you stay at Magda, be sure to visit Corinne Heurbetreuse Boulangerie for breakfast or coffee, and a quick French lesson from the friendliest owner. My daughter loved our walks down for fresh croissants.We will return, hopefully soon!!\n",

If you are going to Paris and don't know your way around, know this: this place is a great choice. It's the little things though (no pun intended). The bed When they say it's a KING size bed, it's rather on the line of \"little\" king size bed. The breakfast situation is where it gets a little complicated. It's not about the quality of what is offered. Everything is there, everything is nice. Tables are tiny though. I find the \"concept\" toaster, coffee machine and egg boiler kind of difficult to get. Some instructions would be in order. For the life out of me I couldn't make that thing spit out coffee instead of hot water. But this would be totally irrelevant if only they had AN EXTRA PERSON on the floor clearing the tables and available for issues like this. THe only person they have would be gone for sometimes 20 minutes. I understand, there's probaly plenty to be done in the kitchen but that affects the breakfast experience in my opinion. The first day I honestly thought someone hadn't shown up for work, but on the second day it became clear that they were simply short staffed. That being said, the place is great. Youll have a peaceful. night's sleep in a safe, clean and pleasant place. Breakfast may be turbulent but you'll be fed. I would both recommend and go back there. \n",

All the reception guys speak good English. Breakfast is continental style self service. It can get a little crowded but all on all not bad. In the local area there are several bars, restaraunts, take aways, wine shops and a small supermarket so you can easily cater for any food needs nearby. A short cab ride into the centre of the Montparnasse area will put you in the way of many good Brasserie. Next time we are in Paris I will check the availability here first. \n",

Yup you read it right! He basically called us liars! Then he decided to ‘confirm’ with the other gentleman who had checked us in by calling him. All this time we were standing there like idiots for no fault of our own. After his ‘confirmation’ (because ofcourse Amex and the whole world apparently goes around lying!) he gave a ‘fake’ apology.

The main requirement for me is friendly and welcoming staff which Fred certainly has. Everyone was all smiles. Sadly that where it ends I won’t complain of room not being ready for early check-in as that’s just a bonus. I will complain of a faulty room and no follow up despite my daily complaints to front desk whom all said we will take care of it...... perhaps they did and couldn’t fix it so ignored it. I’m not sure. But as a hotel departmental manager, leaving your quest questioning or ignoring is the absolute worse thing you can do. Sadly this is what happened at Fred. I stopped complaining. I was told they would fix my issue and if not complete a room move. Issues wasn’t fixed. ......no complaint logged on my account. No notes for room move. To be honest the issues were pretty mediocre and didn’t really affect me as I was hardly in my room ....... however if I was then I would’ve been escalated to the GM.

As an American, you hear about the rude Parisians but they did not get the memo. They get Five stars from us. The breakfasts small but delicious with fresh bread replenish throughout the morning. Clean rooms and was very quiet. Bonus is how close they were to the metro. Thank you Tovo for your hospitality.\n",

Fred Hotel fulfilled all my needs and was better than I imagined! First off the staff is top notch and speak English very well. This is a huge deal because there can be a language barrier in France. Second they are very close to the M13 line and a half hour travel from every major attraction. Third the room was a good size and the bed was big enough for two people. This hotel was a great find and I would recommended them to friends. Thanks Fred for a great stay and putting up with the late nights stumbling in.\n",

Downside is that we got the smallest sized room for the weekend and the shower in the room is a wet room situation where the water basically floods the whole toilet. A bit of a hazard as I slipped quite a few times after the shower. The noise level within the hall is very loud and if unlucky you can hear loud individuals voices in their room. Fortunately we could only hear this once in a while and nothing during the night. Great stay for a short weekend.\n",

A few points for feedback, for the bath tub maybe the glass panel could be slightly wider so that the water wont splatter over when one is using the shower and also have some instructions on how to set the tv to english audio will be helpful for tourist like me.

Not a problem for us but outside the room could be noisy as I don't think the room was well insulated. The service at the hotel was good and they had a good baggage storage system. One annoying thing about the room is that you had to hand your key in every time you left which could slow you down. Also, breakfast was a very expensive additional option.

The rooms are true to the site description, clean, efficient, quiet, & confortable. The staff is very helpful and friendly.

      "  review_body : We have travelled to Paris in a group of 4 (2 couples). It took us some time to decide on the hotel, as we wanted to be as close to our friends that live in Paris.That hotel is located in a quite street, very close to the main road where you can find shops etc. Hotel has been refurbished and it is very modern, although rooms are veery small.For the price we have paid this was a really good choice and we would definately go back in the future.Can't comment on the food as we were spending the days out with friends and visited many restaurants in Paris rather than dining at the hotel.If you are looking for a modern hotel in a great location this is certainly the best choice.\n",

I only dealt with the Reception staff and Concierge but they were always smiling and did everything they could to assist.I stay in many hotels. This hotel is a four star property but many other hotels, both in Paris and elsewhere, could learn from the design of the room. It is not super flash or luxurious but just works. There is plenty of light, if you want it, both in the room and the bathroom. There are enough rails to hang the towels on or dry underwear and socks if you need to do this. There is useable desk space, the bed is comfortable and there are a good selection of television channels. Above all the room is quiet and the hotel is in a convenient location.I didn't eat in the hotel as there is an abundance of choice in the vicinity. \n",

      "  review_body : My girlfriend and I had the opportunity to spend a Saturday night at the hotel. To begin with, the location is just incredible: right in the heart of Paris, right above the most central subway station, walking distance to most of the monuments, museums and interesting neighborhoods. Our arrival and check-in: we both were very positively surprised with the lobby, the decorations and quality of service. We were welcomed at the entrance and guided to the front desk where Kabira, very professionally but at the same warmly and heartily, gave us all the information we needed.The room, located on the 5th floor, was clean, modern and very silent as expected from such a hotel. Most interestingly, we had the chance to enjoy a view of the city ranging from St Eustache church in the foreground and Montmartre in the background.We had a romantic dinner in the \"bubble\" located in the interior private garden and enjoyed the kind recommendations of Lucien. Breakfast was served next Sunday morning from 7 to 11 which was very agreeable and gave us the opportunity to enjoy a \"lazy/ cozy\" Sunday morning.To conclude with, we highly recommend the Novotel Paris les Halles for anyone wishing to stay right in the center of Paris and enjoy a quality of service that is considerably above the standards one would expect from a 4* hotel.\n",

The breakfast was varied and there were a good number of options. The only negative is that there was supposed to be bread gluten free options but there wasn't any available. The staff at reception was always helpful especially giving us assistance to go around with the strike. They organized taxis and transport for us on many occasions and also offered some great resturant suggestions. The place was extremely clean and room service was also spot on.

The hotel is big. Out room was on the top floor. Although the view was not all that great.Decent size room, with separate walk in shower & separate WC area. Sofa cum extra bed was offered in the room for my daughter.As we arrived here on my daughter's bday, so the room was decorated with balloons & some complimentary drinks were offered in the room for all 3 of us.The breakfast here was good, with both hot & cold dishes served. You must reach the restaurant by 8 am though, otherwise you might have to stand in queue though.The hotel also offers an outside patio restaurant, offering beautiful seating with dim lights & under the trees. The hotel doesnt have a swimming pool, it has a fitness center (Gym) though.Chatelet being the main station, connects almost all the other metro & RER lines. So, it is a huge advantage. The hotel is 10 minutes walking distance from Notre Dame Cathedral & 10 minutes walking distance from Louvre museum.The chatlet staion also offers various shopping outlets, if you are interest in shopping.We loved & enjoyed our stay here & we would recommend this hotel to everyone.\n",

We were in Paris to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday. We had a fabulous, fabulous stay because Paris is a great place to visit but also because Les Halles provided such good service to go with the spacious and clean rooms. The reception gives an excellent first impression - both in appearance (modern, smooth, clean) and the efficient check-in. We had rooms on the sixth (top) floor which were quiet. The hotel is in a great location to explore Paris. There is access to the Metro just outside and you can walk to Notre Dame or The Louvre in a leisurely 15 minutes. After a busy day of sightseeing we found the ambience in the bar to be very relaxing. Large, comfortable chairs in which we reviewed our day over a drink. The staff were excellent and we also enjoyed a bar meal here on our final evening. Service was quick and friendly. Breakfast was always busy in the restaurant, but we were quickly shown to a table, and there is a wide choice from the hot and cold buffets. On check-out, a taxi was arranged by the hotel so that we could catch our train.The location, the building and the excellent staff made our stay a wonderful one and I would recommend this Hotel to anyone. We are planning a return visit next summer. (I am aware that I have used many superlatives in this review, but we are still raving about our stay and expect to do so for months to come.

I would like to especially mention Juan Cruz who gave us the best service in giving us directions, etc. He answered all our questions, was always very cordial and is an excellent individual. He was always very courteous and attentive. I would recommend this hotel also for its location, food, great staff and excellent service. If I go back to Paris, I will definitely stay at this hotel again. Sylvia V\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at the Novotel in Paris Les Halles for 5 nights and everything was perfect. The facilities were great and staff was super friendly. Location was perfect with a short stroll to either Louvre or Ile de France/ Notre Dame / Le Marais. Metro/RER Chatelet Les Halles station is at the hotel’s doorstep which is also linked with a Westfield shopping centre. There was a little kids room and gym in the hotel which were a bonus. The only downside with our room was it was a connecting room and although the internal door to the other room was locked, we could hear people in the other room very clearly due to the door gaps. We did ask the reception to change room but were advised they were fully booked. \n",

The neighborhood is vibrant with loads of restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is good, executive rooms well equipped and reasonable spacious, some have nice views but some facing the street side face a lot of noise at night. The breakfast buffet offers healthy choices with fresh fruits and muesli with soja milk. Friendly staff, especially Mrs. Myriame, welcomes you.\n",

The bathroom was functional and large. The room was quiet. The location is excellent. Service at this hotel is mediocre. At check in we were greeted by friendly staff and we were provided early check in. As members of the loyalty program , we received our complimentary drinks which we had in the bar. Bar service was less than impressive, and the drinks were subpar. We had purchased an add on to our room package for dinner in the restaurant. We were not told that the restaurant was actually closed on the evening of our stay. We spoke to reception twice requesting a refund and the staff was extremely snooty, stating there was nothing they could do. Once they realized that we had not paid in advance, suddenly they were able to remove the charge without issue. Check out was slow and inefficient, there were not enough staff at the desk.Overall, this hotel is clean, comfortable, well designed, but I feel that the service needs to be refined to improve the experience.\n",

The hotel registration staff was efficient in getting us our room. The breakfast staff was always organized. The cleaning ladies were always attentive to our needs and had our room nicely made every day. The shower is very nice. Water pressure is good, I usually don’t take long showers, but it was a nice treat to shower at the end of a long day—especially with the rainfall shower head.

Water is not expensive--0.60-0.70 euro a bottle. In the morning of our departure date, a cleaning person knocked on our door at 9 AM when we had until 12 PM to check out. From our room, we could hear noises from the street even though the windows were not open. This is different than another 4-star hotel in the 5th ARR we'd stayed during the same trip. Their windows were very good quality and thick enough that when we closed them we couldn't hear noises. In summary, we expected more from Novotel and will not come back because there are so many better 4-star hotels in Paris with better service and value. Lastly, when we returned home and checked out online account, we saw an additional charge of $165.87 which is still pending. This is a big surprise because we already paid in full at the time of booking. Hope the charge will clear in a few day. If not, we will call to complain. \n",

Really easy access from train station (short walk). Perfect location for restaurant, fast food, supermarkets and shopping. Perfect location for sightseeing. Luckily Check in was quick and easy as we’d just come from Disneyland Paris and were absolutely shattered. We arrived after 6pm. We were put on the first floor which was great with a room at the front of the hotel. Very spacious considering 4 of us were sleeping in it. Really clean, comfortable beds (even the sofa pull out of the kids), extra pillows, towels, molten& brown toiletries, nspresso coffee machine and pods, safe (free to use), fully stocked fridge (extra charge), tv with main English channels, large wardrobe and perfect view. We didn’t pre book breakfast but decided on 2 days we would eat in the hotel (charged to the room and payed for on checkout) Children under 16 eat free on the buffet breakfast when adults buy breakfast. Loads of choice (the usual hot breakfast, cereals, pastries, bread station, children’s station) always had tables ready and good value for money when children eat free. Every part of the hotel was clean and staff always had a smile and a greeting whenever you saw them. Perfect hotel for a perfect trip. Kids loved the “poshness” . \n",

      "  review_body : A new building in a particularly appealing part of Paris. Close to the Metropolitain; lots of very good restaurants close by; rue du Commerce with plenty of shops is just around the corner. No parking at the hotel and no 5 minute parking in front either and we noted that cars parked in the street on a Monday were all papered with E35 parking tickets. There is a parking building about 7 minutes walk away. (Prepay for parking through Parclick or similar and get a lower rate than advised to me by the hotel. You also get unlimited entries and exits for the duration of your booking). Staff were all excellent, spoke English fluently and couldn't have been more helpful. Housekeeping is of a very high standard.There is a swimming pool and a hammam at the first level souterrain which is a nice bonus. The very small lobby and bar has seating for less than 10 people. Perhaps because of that, we didn't see anyone using the bar during our 4 nights.Everything about this hotel was small, except for the bathroom. We booked a \"comfort\" room at E190 per night but comfortable it was not. Using the term \"comfort\" to describe the room is seriously misleading. We carried two overhead-locker-size suitcases but there was no space to leave them out, even zipped up. The edge of the bed had gone soft on one side, perhaps from people using it as a seat. There was one small chair in the corner of the room that blocked off easy access to the very small wardrobe. Getting to the bathroom in the middle of the night was a matter of bouncing off obstructions en route.The breakfast area is equally small and is therefore cramped. The offering at E17 includes cereals and hot dishes. We checked it out - the hot dishes may or may not appeal (they didn't to us) so we opted to eat at one of the nearby brasseries for somewhat less cost.We have been staying at some of the brand-name hotels during our tour of la belle France and should have stuck with them. Rooms are larger and more comfortable, generally, and not priced as high as this hotel. We think this hotel is overpriced. Despite trying hard it is hampered by being cramped and small.\n",

The rooftop area was nice, the pool and steam room was great. We asked for late check out unaware there was a massive cost due to miscommunication between my bf and the receptionist, then we were charged €60 at check out.

Boys really enjoyed the pool and we enjoyed the spa. Happy hour was more like happy 4 hours and the garden and roof terrace are a great place to relax at the end of a busy day. We had an interconnecting room which was very modern and well equipped. Hotel is a 5 minute Uber ride from the Eiffel Tower and big shopping mall a 10 minute walk. Plenty of restaurants and cafes within minutes. Will definitely go back.\n",

      "  review_body : My mother and I visited Paris in July 2019 to see the sights, as one does. We stayed in Les Jardins de Madamoiselle for 3 nights, and were happily suprised by the quality of the accommodation and facilities. The swimming pool was just long enough for lengths, and the steam room was warm and comfortable. The gym left a little to be desired, but considering it was in the basement of a relatively small hotel it was still a nice facility to have.The rooms themselves were modern, clean and comfortable, if a little small; the air con was efficient and quiet; the shower was powerful; and most rooms command a lovely view over either the street or interior garden. My mum was especially pleased to be able to see the Eiffel Tower from her suite on the top floor.The hotel is situated near many lovely restaurants and cafés (more than enough for a different restaurant each day of a visit) and we found that the eiffel tower could be reached in half an hour of walking. The hotel is also very near the Commerce metro station on line 8.All in all this hotel was fantastic. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone travelling to Paris on holiday. \n",

It's very close to the Commerce metro station, but still located in a quieter, residential part of the city, so there were very few tourists and no crowds. Adorable shops around the corner with plenty of great local bistros and cafes for dinner/drinks in the evenings, if you don't want to stray far from the hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful, comfortable, nicely appointed, and clean. Delicious, robust breakfast offered in the mornings. Both the courtyard gardens and the rooftop terrace offer FABULOUS locations for a breakfast coffee or an evening glass of Bordeaux (which they sell at the bar) in a quiet, classically Parisian setting. Their kind, helpful, English-speaking staff that really made our stay wonderful. We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to Paris!\n",

      "  review_body : Les Jardins de Mademoiselle is one year old, located in a quaint residential Parisienne neighborhood convenient to all of Paris via the Metro. The lobby is small but modern and clean. There is a small outside private garden to sit. The breakfast room is a tiny \"L\" shape with barely enough room for the servers to work. The receptionist, Anna (I believe) was welcoming and allowed us our room early. Our room was small but modern and had a balcony. Breakfast was very good and well beyond continental. My only complaint occurred just before checkout. Our flight was delayed so I wanted to change the time of my taxi pick-up from 7 am to later. I tried calling the front desk for nearly 40 minutes with no one answering. What would have happened if me or a guest suffered an emergency such as medical or if we were attacked? I spoke to the receptionist who said that he had to go downstairs and set-up breakfast. I told him that he should have a cell phone which he said he did but it did not work. He told management. This is a horrible breach of faith for a hotel that we paid nearly $220 per night. Would I stay here again? Probably not. Would I recommend it to others? Probably not.\n",

      "  review_body : Had a wonderful stay at the hotel last week whilst exploring Paris. Hotel is very conveniently located in a delightful, safe, and accessible neighbourhood. Very short walk to Commerce Metro, making it simple to reach any part of the city (handy if you are arriving by Eurostar). Having said this, we felt it was a pleasant walk to (or at least back from) any of the major sights along the Seine, so opted to do this most days. It is also a direct walk to the Eiffel Tower. We were always greeted by friendly and welcoming staff, who were keen to help and ensure our stay was comfortable. The room was small by American standards, but reasonable for a European city hotel. Our room (which overlooked the quiet courtyard) was always cleaned thoroughly and had everything we needed for a short stay. The pool was immaculate. We did not have breakfast as there are many delicious boulangeries/shops in the area. Overall, this is a great hotel if you want a clean and comfortable base for exploring Paris, which is located a convenient distance from the 'tourist-trap' areas. I hope this new hotel maintains these high standards, so we can use it as our 'go-to' hotel when visiting the city!\n",

      "  review_body : A very clean and new hotel with outstanding staff. Rooms are average size for Paris, so no surprise. The shower is new and works very well. We are not breakfast people, so we had espresso brought to the room each morning. As others have written, the pool is brand-spanking new and very clean. The steam bath is often not hot enough, something which could be easily remedied. The hotel is on a quiet street within easy walking access to the Commerce metro. If I was to give one recommendation, I would suggest that you purchase pates, roast chicken, foie gras and several salads from the Boucherie du Square on Rue du Commerce. There is also a cheesemonger on the same street. We purchased all that plus bread and wine (also on the same street) and had a wonderful picnic on the 4th-floor terrace of the hotel. The staff provided us plates, wine glasses and utensils and even cleared everything away. Frankly, this was one of our best meals in Paris. There are also neighborhood bistros for coffee or beer/wine. This locale is great if you want to get away from the hustle bustle of the more touristy areas yet still be within easy reach via subway.\n",

When we arrived the reception staff went out of their way to be helpful.The room was fully equipped with a safe, a hob, microwave, fridge, dishwasher (& tabs) kettle, toaster, iron and all the basic kitchen equipment we needed. (as another reviewer said a roll of kitchen towel or a wiping down sponge would fave been useful too). We bought supplies from the nearby Carrefour supermarket and pretty much catered for ourselves in the room. Every time we came back to the hotel from one of our forays out we grabbed a free hot drink from the foyer.The hotel is very central and we easily walked to the Louvre and the Musee d’Orsay. In the other direction we walked to Norte Dame and the amazing stained glass Sainte Chapelle. The jump on/jump off batobus is worth doing from nearby St Michel quai. The hotel is very secure - you need the QR coded plastic key to get back into the hotel and to use the lift. My only criticism - and its a small one - is the constant feint hum of the air-con, which you can’t switch off even at night.The bed was comfortable and slightly on the firm side. The room, which faced the side so we did have a bit of a view of the river, was quiet with the window shut.We would definitely recommend this hotel - they even brought some chocolates to the room for my husband’s birthday, which was a lovely touch.\n",

      "  review_body : My husband and I stayed here for a week in November. Our vacation started out pretty stressful because Air France lost our checked bag, which had most of our clothes/toiletries/shoes. Luckily when we arrived at the hotel, check in was pretty easy. We arrived early in the morning so we dropped off our carry-on with the staff and explored around the area. Overall, the hotel staff was very friendly and professional and our room was the perfect size for us. It was a little small compared to American standards but I think that's the normal size in France. PROS: Shout out to the weekend manager (Mr.Tuong) who was very accommodating and also very helpful when it came to showing us how to navigate the city and which places to go. The hotel's location was perfect; right next to the Seine River, 15-20 min walk to the Louvre, and 15-20 min metro ride to the Eiffel Tower. Near St. Micheals statue (5 min walk from hotel), there are a lot of shops and restaurants to explore. CONS: Whenever we had to print something (ex.boarding pass, tickets), the printer did not work so we had to bother the receptionist to print from their computer.Depending on your stay, housekeeping only cleaned our room once during the week. This wasn't a big deal for us, just more of a surprise. However, they did have a room in the lobby for you to get new towels & toiletries if needed. METRO HELPFUL HINT: It is so much easier and cheaper to take the metro/train than a taxi/uber/walking. Individual metro tickets were over 1 Euro going one way and a lot of times you had to change stations. If you plan to use the metro, train, or bus, definitely get the Navigo Decouverte Pass. It's about 30 Euros and includes the pass (good for 10 years) and 7 days worth of unlimited rides in 5 zones of Paris (this included Versailles, Disneyland, etc). You scan your card at each terminal and since this card is nontransferable (unlike the NYC metro cards), each person has to get a separate card. We got lost a couple times and since this was unlimited, we didn't have to worry about adding more money on.\n",

So, we scrambled online to find an alternative at the last minute, using \"apartment hotel\" as the search criteria. That's how we found Citadines - several in Paris - and in particular the Citadines Saint-Germain-des-Pres. The price was equivalent to the flat we had scheduled and it was located on the Seine a 5-minute walk to the Louvre, Notre Dame and lots of shopping and restaurants. The hotel was nicely appointed and the room was immaculate. We were on the 6th floor overlooking the Seine with a breathtaking view of the city. The room was spacious, the kitchen had two burners, a microwave, dishwasher and small fridge. And the staff were courteous, efficient and very helpful (we had a lot of questions, as this was our first trip to Paris). Having found this haven, we were free to enjoy our vacation with peace of mind.\n",

There was a link from a bathroom that flooded the floor of the room and the hotel did nothing to address the problem. For two days, we waded through the bathroom scum. Finally, they put is in another room without fixing the problem. The staff really doesn't care and if you do have a problem, I'm afraid you are without recourse. Sad that the hotel cares so little about sanitation and the health and safety of its guests. I never write poor reviews of hotels, ever.

This is our second time in Paris with the kids, and our first trip was a week, and this one was 10 nights.We stayed in a 1BR apartment, and our room had ample space. The living room became the kids room as the couch became a pull out double bed. TV’s in lounge room and bedroom so allowed separate viewing.Toilet was separate from bath/shower. The small kitchenette was brilliant as we could have breakfast each day.Were you are is central Paris, in a lovely safe area. We wandered around in the morning to get breakfast in local patisserie’s, we ate out in the evening in wonderful restaurants, and ate fast food at the many Greek and Lebanese foodaries.Our room was only serviced once during the stay, but it allowed us to relax and be a bit messy. If you needed towels etc, they were all available downstairs.Downstairs is a laundry and coffee bar, and you can get breakfast if you do desire it. Staff are wonderful, and if you need to print Disney tickets ( we went for the first time this trip) they will print them for you if you email them to their address. They were great with this, and they didn’t charge us.The hotel doesn’t have the French charm some people look for, but we stay here as a family. If you want French charm you need a different hotel.The St Germain area is brilliant, and Citadines St Germain is brilliantly located. Notre-Dame is to the right, Pont neuf is to the left and you can easily see the Eiffel Tower from there.Our Parisian home away from home.\n",

Listed below are the positive and negative factors:Positive Factors - In General the staff was very helpful except as noted below- Our family of 4 had a very large 1 bedroom apartment with a good sleep sofa in living room. See photo of view from apartment below.- The apartment was quiet almost all the time and had a fully equipped kitchen - Saint Germain location was central located to the Saint Michel area with tens of restaurants, shops, bakeries and markets. The canal is right across the street where you can walk/run,catch a boat cruise or rent bikes- Also very close to Metro, Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral (under repair) and other museums Negative Factors - The 2 elevators in the main tower ran in my opinion in a unsafe manner. As you ride up in the elevators they shook in a jerky fashion that I never seen before in my entire life. I reported it to the front desk 2 times with no action. I reported it a third time to another staff member who promised to have their maintenance staff look at it but, the problem continued to the morning we left.- The fitness center only had barbells up to 9 KG and the weight machine was very dated. The elliptical machine didn’t fully work. The fitness center wasn’t even close to what you find in a Residence Inn.- There is free coffee and tea in lobby but, you have to pay for breakfast and to have your room cleaned. Given the moderately high room rate we paid I consider this to be a serious drawback.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here for four nights during the heat wave in early July. The air conditioned rooms/lobby were much appreciated. This is not a 5 star luxury resort, it is a no-frills functional apt-style hotel that is ideal for families. We had a small suite style room that had a king sized bed for the adults and a couch that rolled out into two twin sized beds for our two kids. The bathroom was large with a tub/shower and the kitchenette contained the amenities you would need to store food/have a few meals in your room. Our room was not serviced at all. We knew it would not be cleaned daily, but we thought someone would come to clean it at some point as we were there 4 nights. We did not put in a service request, so look into this if you are contemplating a longer stay. There is a linen closet in the lobby area so we did drop off our dirty towels for fresh ones half way through our stay. The gym area is small and not air conditioned. (I could not find AC or a fan). There are a few treadmills, a few weight machines and free weights. Probably fine most of the year, but it made working out during the heat wave difficult. The hotel faces the Seine, you step out the hotel and it’s literally at your footsteps. At first, I was overwhelmed with how touristy the area was. However, as you walk south, away from the river, it immediately quiets down and becomes much less hectic, like a regular neighborhood. Because of this, I think the location is ideal, as you get the best of both worlds. There are several subway stops within a 5-10 min walk, a post office, and grocery stores. Breakfast at the hotel is pricey (I can’t recall if it was 16 euros or 26 euros for adults, half price for our 7 yo, and free for our 5 yo.). It’s a non-impressive buffet style hotel breakfast with bread, jams, fruit, cheeses, cereal, and a few hot items (egg, a meat, waffles). Plenty of coffee and juice. There is complimentary coffee, hot water, and hot chocolate all day in the lobby as well. We ate there a few times because it was stress free, the kids enjoyed it, and it fueled them up for the day. It’s hard to grab a cab from the front of the hotel because of the traffic and the river, the hotel actually recommends a pick up point down the street. That’s fine for a regular day, but we had an early morning flight to catch and didn’t want to drag our heavy suitcases to the taxi pickup point. The Front desk clerks were very helpful in calling us a taxi for the airport, the driver came promptly, parked right in front of the hotel and helped us with our bags. The hotel also made sure the fare was the standard rate so we didn’t have to haggle or negotiate with the driver.If you are realistic about what the hotel is and what it is not, then you’ll have a very nice stay here. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again our next time in Paris.\n",

Two different Metros were very close so getting anywhere was very easy. (Four stops to the Eiffel Tower). On arrival the staff were brilliant and could not have been any more helpful. They were able to point out where a Supermarket and Post Office were located as well as the Metros and good Cafes. They were also able to help me with which Metro lines to use.The hotel has a laundry for guests, which is very handy when spending a month away from home.What was also great is that with the very hot weather in Paris the Air conditioning was excellent.All in all, a great place to stay\n",

You will not find a better location.We chose this hotel because they offered a junior suite, which is essential if you have a teen and cannot afford two hotel rooms at a really nice hotel. We were very happy we chose this hotel, and while it was not perfect, the many pluses outweighed the very few negatives.Pluses:GREAT service, friendly, multilingual staffThe coffee machine in the lobby was AWESOME. The junior suite / 1-bedroom apartment was perfect for a family.The kitchenette was really niceAir Conditioning in Paris when it's hotVery nice beds and beddingRooms were quietLocation is absolutely unmatched.Minor improvements would be wonderful:Laundry machines did not always work perfectlySignage was sometimes insufficient. When a large portion of your clientele does not speak French, perhaps signs in laundry room, breakfast room, and other common areas in English would be useful.Our 1-bedroom apartment had a distinct lack of furniture in the bedroom. Yes, space was at a premium, but it badly needed a corner shelf or someplace to store clothes.Overall, this is a really, really good hotel and we will stay here again as soon as we can!

When we arrived to the hotel after a long day we were informed that our reservation was cancelled for no obvious reason. Lee Trinh the manager was not helpful at all in resolving the issue. On the contrary, he kept changing his statement regarding what had happened for a LONG 4 HOURS until we contacted Delta Vacation that made him accommodate some of us that night and the rest end up checking in a separate hotel till the next day. The hotel itself and the location was great, yet the unprofessional front desk service wasted the rest of our day that we could have done so much in the city that day.\n",

He said “The driver was waiting there since 5:05am and you are 20 minutes late! He is hungry and cold.” Ummm I said 5:15 they call so he can be there by 5: 20am which is when we were there! Plus we are paying him! It’s not a shuttle service, moron! So that’s self explanatory. Toilets were not serviceable so we had to use the lobby toilets. Tubs didn’t flush. So we had to leave the next morning with our suitcases and wait for the new unit to be cleaned. But at 2pm the room was still not ready! That meant our kids couldn’t take their naps and they were jet lagged! We paid for those hours and they didn’t prioritize our room! Knowing they had guests that already were homeless after having paid for the weeek! Apartments need major remodel I mean gross!\n",

So almost all the museums, or landmarks are close to walk to or take the subway. There is a person name Fabiola who was the best. She was a true angel. If you can think of a person who is the best customer oriented it is Fabiola. She made restaurant reservations, printed our boarding passes, called taxi service for us when we checked out. She did everything in her power to make our stay as pleasurable as it can be. The only reason I did not give it a 5 rating was the room and hallways need to be updated a little. I know the location makes this hotel and the lobby is very nice, but maybe a little paint and some new rugs and it's a perfect 5. I would definitely recommend this hotel and the price is reasonable.\n",

      "  review_body : We booked for 3 nights. On arrival our room wasn’t ready even though we were supposed to check in for 3pm. Nearly an hour wait, we were talking to the receptionist when our kids who were sat with our bags ran over and told us that someone had taken one of our bags!! We frantically started to look around and then quickly told the receptionist who was serving another guest. She was not in the least worried and told us to wait. We then told her no, that this was urgent, and that she needed to deal with the situation. She then made a call and it transpired that another guest had walked off with it to his room thinking it was his! The lack of concern really annoyed us. On our first night we asked for extra pillows as our kids were sleeping on the pull out bed. This was two singles that had hard metal frames. We were worried that the kids would be badly scratched if they fell in between the beds. My husband called down to reception and was told there were pillows in the room. When my husband explained that he needed more, she kept saying they were in the room. As he kept explaining over and over again, she put the phone down on him!Breakfast was certainly not worth €16 for adults for the choice. It was really basic and consisted daily of two hot items, scrambled egg and bacon or scrambled egg and sausage for example. There was also a very small selection of fruit, crepes and other pastries, a couple of different yoghurts and some cereal, bread and cheese. Staff at breakfast were really nice and so too was the gentleman from housekeeping who brought us the extra pillows. Pros-The hotel provides free coffee and hot drinks, plus fizzy and filtered water- It’s so central you can walk to the main sites and are so close to the Seine.- Room was large and airy-Bathroom looked nice and newCons- - Staff in reception need a course in Customer Service!-The floors are very tired. Carpet and hallways look dirty and dated- Room could have been cleaned better. On the first day they didn’t even make the kids beds even though we had a servicedapartment -Curtains in our room had holes in them!\n",

Paris was going through a record-breaking heatwave but our studio was a cool, air-conditioned haven from sightseeing. There are so many bakeries, traiteurs (shops selling ready cooked food), street markets and cheese shops in central Paris (some just round the corner) that it made sense to stay in a place with a kitchenette where we could prepare our own food, rather than being confined to eating in restaurants. Our linens were changed and the bathroom and kitchenette cleaned mid-way during our week's stay so housekeeping was adequate but unintrusive. I was impressed when I developed a medical problem on the Saturday of our stay and a guest relations manager kindly helped me sort it out in a very efficient way. \n",

      "  review_body : Where to start. The Citadines St Germain des Pres, Paris is a wonderful apartment hotel in an incredible location in downtown Paris along the Seine. We are a family of 4 with a 16 year old boy and 10 year old girl. A challenge we had was finding a hotel room in the city center with three beds (King/Queen and two singles). Most hotels recommended two rooms but the rooms were not interconnected, meaning we would have to go to the hall in order to enter the other room. This was not something we were comfortable doing. We discovered the concept of the apartment hotel which is literally a small apartment with two rooms, bathroom, and a small kitchen. We continued to have issues with three beds. The Citadines had a pull out couch that turned into two single beds side by side (but separate) however, we chose to rent a roller bed. We chose to also upgrade and stay in a room with a Seine River view. The room was huge! Even with the roller bed there was plenty of room in the hotel for four people with 8 bags. Upon entering the room, there was a small anteroom with a good sized closet, a door opposite the main door to the bathroom, and a room to the right with a king bed, desk, TV and closet. There was also a room to the right with another smaller closet with safe, a large desk, couch (which pulled into two single beds) a small table and two chairs. We also added the roller bed. There was still plenty of room to move around. The real jewel was the small kitchen with a two burner cook top, fridge, dishwasher, sink, and microwave and plenty of counter space. The cabinets were stocked with service for four, pot, pan, and mixing bowls. There was a toaster and kettle for boiling water. The room was also stocked with cleaning supplies. Breakfast was available a la carte in a dinning room but for four cost about 50 euros so breakfast in the room was a real blessing. Something to keep in mind with the apartment hotel is that service is not offered daily, but towels were available for exchange and there was a trash chute on the floor to remove trash from the room. The hotel had a laundry room (two washers and two dryers cost 18 euro) the dryers were mostly useless and did not really dry anything but there was a clothes drying rack in the bathroom. There was also a laundry service we did not use. The view of the river was incredible, to the left was Pont Nuef and the Louvre, to the right was Notre Dame (you had to look out the window to see the cathedral but easily visible). we had to pay a premium for the river view, but for our first vacation to Paris is was worth it. The \"master bedroom\" had a view of the courtyard and was much less impressive. Arriving, we had rented a car for the first half our trip outside of Paris. There is no parking in front of the hotel but there were two \"drop off lanes\". The hotel has underground parking but it is on a very narrow street and with any larger than midsize car may not be able to negotiate the turn into the parking garage. We parked in public parking 1.5 blocks away and walked easily to the hotel (after checking in we returned the car as planned as we did not need it in the city). The lobby was clean and bright. There are two coffee machines with espresso, cappuccino, or hot chocolate available 24/7. The staff were courteous and extremely helpful. They all seemed to speak English and were ready to help. A special acknowledgment is needed for Hedi (Pronounced Eddie). He provided us an excellent orientation of the neighborhood, explained restaurants, markets, parking, and shops to us. Making recommendations for restaurants that we followed and DID NOT REGRET.I would recommend this hotel to any family and the Citadines will be first on our list when we return to Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed in this hotel two nights while we waited on a flat that we rent when possible in the 5th on Rue De Ecoles.We chose the location because we have previously rented Apartments on the Quai des Grands Augustins close on either side of this hotel and like this section, close enough to the central Islands and the Boul Mich to quickly drop in with a short walk or hang out with some locals we’ve come to know. Extensive excavations were occurring in central Paris, underground utilities and roadwork to be completed before tourist season began. They were finished so far as we could see on a later trip. . Thus hotel was quite easy to adapt to. The Citadines chain has a number of hotels inParis - we’ve only stayed at this one? It is an much older building in. Sections with extensive modernization that does not detract from a good bit of charm with rooms that a void the cookie cutter mold. Our mini suite was nestled under an upper floor roof, long and narrow, a sloping ceiling in part that was not difficult to negotiate. The well-furnished bathroom was at one end; a sparse kitchenette & sitting area in the middle - the bedroom at the other end. It had character and charm. We had a view of the old street behind the hotel with houses dating to the 1500s. So while the hotel is up to date, the neighborhood is historic and charming..The hotel had a sizeanle clientele of students and academics.The hotel cafe was excellent for breakfast. \n",

I asked to be moved to another room with a tub. We were moved to room 109 which was very nice with a closet and better bathroom. The breakfast was ok, but not too much variety for the 3 days we were there. It would be nice to have fresh omelettes or made to order items.

We could hear our neighbors having a phone conversation.- 'Closet' space was very limited for 2 people to hang any clothes.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed here for three nights. We are unable to compare the hotel with hotels in Paris but compared to others in which we have stayed in Europe for the price, this is average. Decor is not our taste. It is very convenient to some of the attractions. Our superior room was a decent size with nice bathroom. Very clean. Mini fridge was nice. The promise of free drinks is fine but our fridge not restocked. We also did not get restocked on coffee. Breakfast buffet is okay. The free snacks in the afternoon and evening are a nice addition. We wished that the room had a couple of drawers or a place to spread the suitcase. No washcloths. Service was fine.\n",

      "  review_body : It is our last night in Paris. We have been here five nights so far and it has been unforgettable. The hotel is in a great location that is walking distance to the Louvre.Metro stations were nearby and easy to access. On our way in from CDG, we took the RER B to Chatelet Les Halle's and found it super easy to get to the hotel.We thought the hotel was in a great location for walking to all the attractions.I'm not sure what the average walking distance is for people on vacation but for reference we did about 30,000 steps per day on my wife's Apple watch. We pretty much walked everywhere except to Versailles. Walked to Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coeur, and Notre Dame. I think if the spot was within a 2 mile radius of the hotel, we walked and explored.Gemma was fantastic at the front desk. She had some macarons set in our room for my birthday which was a nice touch. Staff during breakfast were nice and helpful. Thank you!The included breakfast is nice to have but I felt the included minibar and snacks/drinks was great for hydrating and filling out water bottles. Most Astotels are north of the Seine and I wouldn't go out of my way to walk to one for a drink/snack. But while out and exploring, we did stop into any ones that we were near to use the restroom or get water.I would come back again! Thank you Hotel Malte staff.\n",

      "  review_body : I have spent many nights in mid-range Paris hotel rooms over the years; Hotel Malte was by far the best. Kind, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful staff, no matter what time of day or night you approach the front desk. Comprehensive breakfast buffet, including a variety of hot and cold items, plus friendly staff who offer you tea or coffee. As a unique and added bonus, their network of Astotels on the Right Bank invites Astotel clients staying at any Astotel to come in, between 2 pm and 2 am, for a snack, a rest and to use the washroom. Hotel Malte is superbly located within walking distance of the Louvre, Notre Dame, la Sainte-Chapelle, l'Opéra, la Seine and close to métro Bourse and les Pyramides. The hotel is nicely decorated, modern and clean. Our room (510) was also clean and nicely decorated. It had a large window opening out to the courtyard; facing the courtyard guaranteed a quiet sleep. The bathroom was very modern, and featured something I haven't come across in a Parisian hotel before: a bathtub. The closet was big enough to accommodate our clothing, two terrycloth robes and slippers were supplied, and the mini-bar was restocked everyday with bottles of water and juice at no extra charge. The elevator worked all the time and was big enough for a few people and their luggage. There is nothing we didn't like about our stay at this hotel, and next time we go to Paris, I will be able to save myself hours of research on TripAdvisor, and simply book Hotel Malte, as they are doing everything right. Thanks, Malte, for a great, hotel experience in Paris.\n",

First of all, it's in a fantastic location which allowed me to walk to all of the major attractions that I wanted to see. The room was very comfortable, albeit small (but hey, it's Paris not Montana) but very nicely appointed with everything that I needed (wifi, room safe, hairdryer, etc.). Breakfast wasn't included in my price but for 10 euros I decided to have it there anyway considering that I would pay that much if not more if I went to one of the local places. Plus, it was very good. Also, it's worth noting that the chain has other hotels in Paris which you can use for restroom stops and free wifi if you stay at any of their hotels. Also, they have free drinks (coffee/water, etc) and snacks. I highly recommend this hotel if you're thinking of staying in the area. Also, for the first time ever, I'd say that the traveler photos don't seem to live up to just how nicely this hotel is decorated and kept up. I really feel like I found a hidden gem in Paris and would stay there again (fingers crossed!). I'm giving it four stars only because the rooms are not exactly sound proof and I could hear my noisy neighbors, but that is my only negative observation.\n",

The daily breakfast (pastries, cheese, fruit, crepes, etc.) was included in our room rate, and they have complementary snacks set out at night. The room was a bit smaller than we are used to in American hotels, but I guess this is standard in Europe. The drinks in the room fridge were complementary and the fridge is re-stocked every day. We had a hard time getting used to a shower with no shower curtain, though. One false move with the hand held shower, and you've got a wet bathroom. I'm sure the housekeeper appreciated that.It's about a ten minute walk to the Louvre, and the closest Metro stop is at the Opera, which is about another ten minute walk in a different direction.If we ever go back to Paris, the Hotel Malte will be our hotel.\n",

Staff were great, always helpful and friendly - especially Gemma who went out of her way to make us feel welcome and provided an exceptional service From both Alejandro and Gemma, we discovered places to experience and they also helped with dinner reservations. They are both so patient, knowledgeable and sweet.The 24 hour complimentary snacks and drinks in the lounge was unexpected and a really nice touch. Would definitely recommend.\n",

We had a room facing the inner courtyard which was quiet at night. The hotel breakfast was outstanding with great variety and good quality. The hotel staff were kind and very accommodating. They called and ordered a van for our party of six when we asked how we could get to the airport. Location is excellent with the Louvre and Tuileries Gardens a ten minute walk and metro a five minute walk.\n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I arrived May 7th. We stayed for 5 nights at this excellent, centrally located boutique style hotel, just a 6 min walk to the louvre, and a few minute walk to the Opera House/Galeries Lafayette. We were welcomed by a most professional, friendly receptionist, named Gemma, and she was quite a gem. She was enthusiastic and eager to warmly advise us and assist us in every matter. The hotel staff and the wonderful hotel manager Stephanie came thru with every special request we asked for above and beyond what we ever expected. Gemma assisted us with a special room (close by to the reception to our request). She also advised us with the best metro/bus app, how and where to obtain a Navigo weekly pass and sim cards for our phones, she explained us where the best places to visit are and which places she suggested to avoid. These and other tips were extremely helpful and saved us a lot of time and money ensuring a smooth experience. I thought that the friendly service was extremely personal. I felt that the staff was sincere and caring looking out for our best interest and it was obvious to both my wife and I that they really wanted us to just have the best time we could. Stephanie and Gemma were attentive to our needs and every special request. She even took the initiative to search online to help us locate the types of places and restaurants we were interested in visiting. They constantly asked if they can help us in any way. The entire reception team (whom I don’t remember all the names) were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was a standard double room. It had everything you need in a room. Good size, quiet, clean, newly renovated and excellent room temperature. The cleaning service was excellent. Every day they made up the room like it was the day we got it. The room was not small as are many hotel rooms in Europe, but rather a decent mid-size room. Bathroom was excellent and big, everything was newly renovated. There were many mirrors in the room, an excellent makeup mirror for the ladies. There's a small mini bar which the hotel fills up daily (free of charge) with bottled soft drinks/bottled orange juice/water. I thought that was a great perk. But there's even a better one, between 2 pm and 2 am the hotel lobby has an excellent (constantly running) complementary refreshments buffet full of cakes, donuts, chips, cold drinks, hot drinks, coffee machine, bar, nuts, vegetable dips etc. It’s kept very clean and was constantly replenished. The staff is very dedicated to the hotel and customer service. Even coming back at 1 am, the receptionist brought me something from the kitchen to my special dietary request, another example of unexpected personal service.Breakfast was wonderful, fully serviced, hot food, salads, fresh fruits and juices, fresh begets and pastry. Fresh Coffee brought by a waiter.That being said, I'm not only recommending the Malte Astotel Hotel to future guests looking to enrich their trip to Paris, but I also want to personally thank Stephanie, Gemma and the rest of the staff for your personal and professional service. Next time in Paris, we hope to see you again.Sincerely Pinchas\n",

      "  review_body : The hotel, rooms, service, breakfast and location are all very good. The bed is comfy and we faced a courtyard so it was quiet. Maybe it's me, but I just can't seem to shower in European showers with that glass covering the first third of the shower. The floor is just soaked by the time i'm done, and instead of trying to be environmentally conscious about not using too many towels, I'm using the whole allotment trying to dry the floor! Ok, done venting.This was a new area of Paris for us, and i'm glad we tried it out. Lots to see, easy to walk. I would give 5 stars to Gemma, who greeted us at the front desk. We were tired and hungry. She got us into our room quickly, and explained everything, including these special deals at other Astotels in Paris. She vas helpful with suggestions on where to eat, walking directions, just about anything we needed to know, Gemma had the answer. I hope she is a valued employee!\n",

      "  review_body : Having stayed twice previously in St Germain des Pres, we were uncertain about staying in a new area. We happily found Hotel Malte to be nicely situated, with easy access to the Metro and many surrounding sites -yes - it is very easy walking distance to the Louvre - (but then you end up waiting 10X longer in the ticket and security lines at the Louvre than the walk from the Malte) The rooms are small but spotlessly clean -we stayed in the standard room - and the breakfast buffet makes it difficult to leave the table. Salmon, scrambled eggs, bacon, a wide variety of pastries, on and on dining delights. Also, later in the afternoon additional treats are put out for the the guests. The front desk staff - Gemma, Alejandro, Thomas, Elvira go WAY beyond just helping you - they want you to be comfortable and at ease. It's always possible to stay in a nice hotel, but when the front staff makes you feel like you're \"at home\", the hotel gains more than just a few stars- you know you made the right choice. Many thanks to all of them.\n",

When we arrived our room wasn’t ready but no problem we could have a drink and they’d store our bags until we returned later so we could explore the city. On our return they had moved our bags to our room ready for us. The hotel was very clean and beautifully decorated. The breakfast had plenty of options as did the snack bar in the afternoon. I like breakfast tea at any time of day with cold milk, not cream and they were very accommodating. Excellent recommendations were made by reception and they were very knowledgeable about getting about and museums etc. My um and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend here as a fab base near a lot of the main sights and transport iptions\n",

Incredible burger joint across the street (Mamie Burger). The rooms were quiet and spotless clean. Same with the hotel. My only complaint, and while small, still played a major role in our trip, was the poor internet. We were in room 110. Right above the check in. Not sure how WiFi couldn’t even accidentally find its way into our room but it did not. It was sad not being able to share our two week vacation each night without venturing downstairs to find reliable service. It is 2019 and this really should be fixed. Other than that, this was just about as perfect a stay as you can get in Paris. Just be prepared to have issues with internet service, if this is important to you. \n",

It also comes with a small fridge and a safe. The fridge is stocked with free water bottles and soft drinks, which are refilled daily - a very nice touch. The bathroom is modern and very clean. The beds are very comfortable. Our room is facing the atrium and it's very quiet, although when the doors were closed in other rooms it makes a pretty loud noise.Breakfast is served in a very spacious and cozy lobby. It comes with decent amount of varieties. They also serve free snacks in the lobby through the afternoon. We've stayed in another Astotel hotel a couple years ago, and the snacks at the time were much better than what they offer now... sigh.Overall it was a very pleasant stay. The only downsides are that the WiFi was not very fast at times. Also they don't have a business center.

This was my SECOND stay at 34B-Astotel because this is how good it is. (thinking about a third already) The location is ideal if not perfect. Very close to all tourist attractions by foot and Metro, the neighbourhood if filled with restaurants for all budgets, cafes, creperies, bars and so on ( I personally recommend The frog & Underground for the best beer and tasty food).The hotel is spotless clean, the rooms are impeccable (one of the few times I saw the cleaning staff actually vacuuming the rooms), with perfectly working heating/air-conditioning.Beds comfortable, free mini bar and most importantly QUIET. It is really hard to find a quiet place in Paris for good rest. First time at this hotel I stayed in the interior court which was extremely quiet but this time I had a street facing room. At first I was scarred of the noise because the streets are very loud and crowded but the hotel is SOUNDPROOF so don't worry if you also get the street rooms.Breakfast is good, not the best I had but decent. Everything is fresh and almost for all tastes. Coffee is horrible, could never drink it, but there are a lot of coffee shops and decent prices nearby. Open bar amazing, found some of the nicest treats there (donuts, muffins etc).Gave 5 stars for the price-quality report, hotel is actually between 3-4 stars.\n",

      "  review_body : We had arrived into Paris on an early flight so on arrival at the hotel our room wasn’t ready which was fair enough and my sister was staying in nearby Les Halles anyway so we went to her hotel instead. We returned after 2pm as advised only for the room not to be ready still. Our friends had arrived in the meantime and checked into their room. Ours was eventually ready by about 4pm. My only criticism. It was worth the wait however! An amazing room over 2 floors with a patio and a spiral staircase! Lovely hotel with plenty of natural light and quirky design touches (tricolore facade, toy car and rocking horses in reception, mini red Eiffel towers on display outside). Sumptuous breakfast awaited every morning. The icing on the cake was the soft drinks and snacks available daily in the lobby and the minibar which made the room rate very attractive (for Paris).Everywhere was spotless and staff were friendly enough. Nice neighbourhood with good local eats notably Archibon. We would stay again or at another Astotel without hesitation.\n",

Breakfast was ample and there was no rush to get to the food and there was a chill out area for guests. Fridge contents were free and topped up daily and extra drinks and pastries and biscuits from 2pm-1am were a bonus. We had a room on the 2nd floor looking into the courtyard area which was nice and quiet and the beds were comfortable. Once you have got your bearings, the metro station is around the corner and there are several in walking distances. You can easily catch the 85 bus to Sacre Couer which only takes 20 mins. You can also use your 1 day metro card on the buses as well. all in all an great stay in Paris for long weekend break!\n",

      "  review_body : This was our third or fourth stay at 34B. Obviously, we enjoy the property. What we especially enjoy is the VERY strong air conditioning and when it's summer in Paris, I won't consider staying anywhere else, not even another Astotel. Sure enough, we had the bad luck to have weather in the mid 90s during our stay, but we were always able to come back to an incredibly cool room (literally, and also figuratively). The staff is excellent, super helpful and friendly. We got a superior room, which was very spacious. We loved breakfast, the free mini bar and the free afternoon snack area. We really enjoy the neighborhood, which is very convenient. If I had to find things to complain about: The wifi was not working sometimes, and sometimes it was super slow. There's not much space to hang things, and only five hangers, so that's one small drawback. I've never seen more than five hangers in a room. And also, on this trip, some of the pillows were weird, like someone had chopped up foam and thrown it in a sack. But two of the pillows were perfectly normal. Still, for the price, this is an amazing hotel.\n",

The breakfast was plentiful and included hot choices of sausage, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes and crepes. As well as breads, meats, cheeses and pastries. All tasty and enough to fill you up! We booked a standard room which was comfortable and clean. The bed was big and comfy with lots of fluffy pillows. The downsides are the WiFi was poor up in the fifth floor, if you like to watch TV at night there are only 2 English news channels and the room could have benefited from an iron and ironing board.

      "  review_body : There are too many choices when picking a hotel in Paris, but between Trip Advisor's reviews and Astotel's website, it was easy to choose this hotel. We booked directly from the Hotel 34B website, which gave us the lowest rate and also free breakfast. The communication from the start with the e-mails was wonderful. I explained that we were staying in Paris to celebrate our anniversary and anything they could do to make it special would be wonderful. The hotel decor is great and the location is close to two metro stops which can get you every where. The breakfast was also wonderful with many choices. The other pluses are the free drinks in the room's refrigerator that are refilled daily and the snacks and drinks in the eating area that are available from 2 pm until very late. I also loved the seating area where you could relax and stretch out whenever you wanted. We stayed in a superior king and the room was wonderful as well as the bathroom. I loved the shower, and the little details like the magnifying mirror were great! When in France you should always try to speak some French, but if you are uncomfortable doing so, the staff speak English. All of the above would be more than enough to have me return to this hotel, but the icing on the cake was that we were treated to champagne and chocolates on our anniversary. It was such a wonderful surprise and made our day very special. Thank you Hotel 34B for the wonderful 10 days that we spent there and we're hoping to return! Merci!!!\n",

We booked the 6th floor family connecting rooms- which was basically the penthouse to the hotel. There was a little corridor with one room housing 2 twin beds, and another one leading to a bigger single king-sized bed. Switches were well-placed. The included mini-bar was just a welcomed reprieve (no alcohol). Toiletries were stocked well and of good quality. The bathrooms were super clean. The beds were awesomely comfy. Included breakfast was varied, well-stocked and had a lot of choices. The open bar (without alcohol) was nice but I never really got to utilize it; you can go to any of their associated hotels and also use THEIR other bars. It was closed to everything north of the Seine and 3 minutes from a metro stop. What more can you ask for?\n",

The room and bathroom are very cleanThe bathroom is with good space the toilet inside the bathroom not in a separate space as in other European hotels and near water for the Muslim people to connect outside washer to the toilet but note there are some rooms in the hotels has separate toilets so if it important for you as for me be sure from the reception about the room.Our room was in the 5th floor on roof and has nice view. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as it was not worth it outside the hotel there is very good cafe and bakery we had our breakfast there and was much cheaper with more quality also the hotel near metro station and supermarket and shops it is in good location.\n",

      "  review_body : This nice hotel is centrally located around everything you need, you can find great bakeries and restaurants just a few minutes walking from the Hotel. The main station for Metro, Trains and RER just 5 mins. walking. Room size is decent with comfy beds, clean sheets and big bathroom, but the toilet can be so cold during the winter. Staff are marvelous, they warmly welcome you, gives you great advice of good places to eat, to shop and to relax. There was a strike that shuts down the public transport and the staffs gives good solution to navigate around Paris during this time. The elevator is unique and serves well, room is clean and this hotel is highly recommended not only for business but also for leisure.\n",

      "  review_body : We booked two rooms here on our day of arrival, and were not disappointed. We decided to amend our travel arrangements to avoid the transportation strike, so railed in to St. Lazare Wednesday evening, and walked the very short distance to the Atlantic. The hotel is literally adjacent to the station. On arrival, we were greeted cheerfully, and given an overview of the property. We were only there for one night, but each time we left, the staff remembered us on return to the hotel, and had our keys ready. This was a really nice touch of hospitality. Overall, a great one night stay in a central location, for an affordable price. We would recommend this property.\n",

      "  review_body : Lovely boutique hotel close to Gare St. Lazare. We were 3 adults (parents plus young-adult daughter) so needed a larger room with queen-size bed plus a twin. Not large by US standards, but very comfortable for our 6-night stay. Exceptional bathroom and shower: modern, spacious, clean with great water pressure/temp control. Air conditioning was excellent: Paris was in the midst of a heat wave June 20-26 so we retreated to the hotel between 5 and 7 before heading out for evening activities. St. Lazare station is a 5-minute walk away. We took the Metro every day into the city center. Entrance to station is through a multi-level shopping mall. Always stopped at grocery on lower level for the day's provisions. Enjoyed two light dinners in the ground-level brasserie. Food was as wonderful as the air conditioning! Most often we ate breakfast in one of the small restaurants around the hotel, but the Atlantic offers both full and express breakfasts that are good and fairly priced. Upon arrival, we noticed that there was some construction across the street from the hotel and worried about noise. No noise at all inside the room, and our windows looked out on one of the construction areas. Wonderful stay! If we could have stayed longer, we would have.\n",

Pls note that airport taxi cost 55 euros flat, we were conned by the airport taxi who switched on the meter once we got to the city and paid around 80 euros. Anyway we booked the room for 3 pax and it was sufficient just that the only lift was small and the old school type so a little slow. You have to leave the hotel room key with the reception every time u head out and they don't do any security check so I suggest u lock all valuables up just in case. Toilet in our room was quite big, only thing was the shower. It was difficult to adjust the temperature so it was quite hot. \n",

We stayed in rooms 113 and 112. 113 had up dated fixtures, 112 had a tub to climb into. Using the bathrooms was always an issue. Many times windows and doors had to be opened to air out the room because it was so small. Be sure to pack away all your stuff because in no time the room turned into a hot mess because of the limited space. The service was done daily, the only thing was the cleaners would come super early- just put the 'do not disturb' sign up- but remember to remove it when you want your room cleaned. The down sides to this hotel include: they give you only one key to your room. Every time my husband went out I had to get up or wait around to let him back into the room. One time I was taking a shower and he had to wait in the hallway. The key also controls the lights in the room, so the one I gave him the key I was left in darkness until he came back- the tv worked. Also, once everyone in the room left for the day we had to give up the key and then pick it up whenever we returned. Late at night the doors do not open automatically, you'll have to ring the bell. The ups: best location- SUPER easy to commute MOST of the must see attractions in Paris. I gave this hotel an excellent rating only because of location. Trains and buses are near and usually only 25-30 mins away from any attraction. Staff is pleasant, they didn't replenish the toiletries when they were used up- I'm a collector of hotel goodies so I was disappointed. I would book this hotel again but have only 2 persons to a room.\n",

The bathrooms were huge and the water pressure was a delight. The tubs were deep and comfortable too.The rooms came with a mini fridge, enough to hold bottles of water or any other beverage you may buy. Although the mini fridge is stocked with spirits, there was room for other items too.We opted for the breakfast in the morning. It was wonderful. We ate there for the three days we stayed. It was fresh, the croissants were amazing and the two ladies always kept up with ensuring items were replenished.However, I must say the staff at the front desk were fantastic. We had an incident where and item was left and in Uber and the front desk spent countless hours contacting the driver and bugging him until he returned the item that evening, at midnight.

It is very close to a major train station, which includes the metro and sncf. The breakfast was basic and expensive, but use it if you're in a hurry or just don't want to be bothered; there aren't many Parisian breakfast places around, just bakeries and delis.

      "  review_body : We stayed here over the Easter weekend. We got a taxi from the airport which cost us 120euro! We spoke with the hotel only to be told that it should of been 60 euros at most, we were basically told there are three main taxi companies in Paris and this can't of been one of them and tough luck for getting diddled out of money, although this is not the hotel staff's fault I do believe that they should of been more sincere and not gone with the \"tough luck\" approach. The hotel room was very clean but a little on the small side, but what you would expect for the price. We ordered room service one day and it was lovely, however you aren't far from lots of restaurants so you'll never be short of options for food. My partner asked for an iron one morning as there isn't one in the room but they have ironing rooms - one iron wasn't working so went back to reception to ask for another only to be told the iron was working, after lots of back and forth the lady behind reception begrudgingly went to the other ironing room with him and unlocked the door, not before making a comment of \"I'm not doing it for you\" when never asked to. The bed wasn't overly comfortable but still managed to sleep okay. Check out was good - the gentleman on reception at 4:30am was lovely.Overall the hotel was in a great location and was clean - however the staff could of been better.\n",

We loved our stay - our room size was perfect, the bed was comfortable, and the breakfast was impeccable. The staff are so friendly and kind, even before our stay the front desk helped me make dinner reservations for restaurants that didn’t allow me to make one online. The hotel location is also wonderful, it is near a large park and delicious restaurants (we strongly recommend Le 217 Brasserie and Bistrot de le Porte Doree for dinner, and the Boulangerie (Vandermeetsch) across the street had the best pastries of our trip (be forewarned, there is a line out the door at almost all times!). The only downside to our stay was that the metro strikes interferes with our ability to take public transportation with ease. We took a lot of Ubers and Kaptains, but were able to navigate our way home one evening by train using google maps and getting creative. This was just unlucky, as long as the metro is running, everything about this hotel and location is perfect! \n",

The hotel is about 10 seconds from the metro (exit 3 I think) with a 24 hour reception. We were on the top floor, you could feel the metro underneath but not enough to keep you awake at all (my parter did not even notice). Checking in and out is very easy. We did not stay for breakfast so we cannot comment here. The rooms are very clean, as well as the bathroom- which had a separate very small toilet but this does not matter. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are nice and warm (we stayed in winter) but with the big window, it looks like it would be cool in summer. Overall, the staff were lovely and the rooms were perfect, it does look ever so slightly tired like it will need some work doing in the main areas (staircases) in the next few years. Especially with the good value, we thought it had lots of lovely character compared to lots of the modern Paris hotels. We would stay here again! Thank you!\n",

At night time, when you are exhausted after coming from Paris attraction tour, you don’t need to walk to hotel. It is just outside the metro station. While coming from Disney, we have taken uber cab. As it is on outskirt of Paris, it is close to Disneyland and we have saved the money and time in it. Location is also close to Gare De Lyon station, we have taken cab from the hotel and it has taken around 15 to 20 min to reach station. Room is having a water bottle with wonderful design, we just loved it. Room size is small, but we have enjoyed it.Staff is superb helpful and polite. They will guide you what ever, you want to know.Grocery store is also at road crossing to hotel. We have taken water bottles and fruits from that store.Hotel lift is small but that is not a problem. You have to be in lift for only few seconds, so not an issue. It was basically a fun. Ha ha.Breakfast is also very nice and have good variety of food to choose from. Sitting is also very nice. Hotel only serve breakfast. For lunch and breakfast, you have to go outside.

Free bottles of water were in our room (sparkling or still), and for a reasonable charge they will also provide flowers, petals, wine, or champagne. The Metro stop is only a 1-2 minute walk away. We did not opt for the hotel breakfast, as there were several nice cafes and restaurants nearby.

We found Hotel de la Porte Doree on TripAdvisor, and took an Uber to check it out.

      "  review_body : I absolutely loved everything about this hotel except for the rumbling and noise from the metro underneath. I understand why they offer ear plugs in the rooms.The bedding and towels are very high quality, and the rooms impeccably clean. The rooms are beautiful and well air conditioned. There are some nice teas along with a kettle and things for coffee. The staff is lovely and very helpful. I also appreciate their ecological approach. Unless you’re a very light sleeper, I highly recommend!!\n",

The breakfast was generous and had enough variety to keep everyone happy. There were some nice touches in the room, such as flapjack on arrival and a few toys to play with. The shower and bath were lovely and everything was very clean. \n",

It is a great value with wonderful customer service. The rooms are very clean and well appointed with comfortable beds. Coffee and water is available all day in the lobby.The front desk speaks English and is always available to accommodate your requests. It is very easy to get around Paris with the metro within a minute walk from the hotel's front door. Across the street is a bakery, grocery store and ATM. The Bois de Vincennes is a five minute walk from the hotel and a zoo, flowers, boats and bikes for renting many. walking trails. I have recommended this hotel to many friends.\n",

Fridge in room really helps. Staff are extremely helpful. Other people have commented on the noise. We were on the top floor and were not disturbed. Could hear metro but it was in no way disturbing and its proximity to the hotel was an enormous bonus when travelling around.We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, instead got exquisite pastries from the boulangerie opposite and fresh squeezed OJ from the Franprix next door. I travelled with my two daughters 15 and 7. We stayed 2 nights - 1 day at Versaille, 1 at Disneyland and 1 sightseeing. The hotel were extremely accommodating and let us drop off our bags prior to checking in and looking after them after checking out allowing us to maximise our time.Would recommend getting the hotel yo book car yo anf from CDG.

      "  review_body : I am totally baffled how this hotel has such wonderful reviews, this hotel is just one disappointment after another. I can handle the outside noise, including the subway that roars through every so often. I live in a very loud area myself but you can hear every floorboard creak, door shut, and the sounds reverberate. The room is ice cold, it’s below freezing outside and I’m told by the front desk I cannot control the heat myself, I’m stuck with whatever temperature the hotel chooses. I’m not even going explain how ridiculous this is. I’m a person who likes to be cold (I live in a cold climate) but this is uncomfortable. The “helpful” front desk person who pretends not to understand English or French suggested I get another jacket (I guess this is the only English phrase they know). Based off the 3 interactions I have with this person I can only assume they would rather be anywhere but here also, ME TOO! The bathroom is the temperature of Siberia and the only source of heat is a towel rack that is so close the toilet so if you want to use the toilet, you should sit sideways (yes, side saddle the toilet) to avoid getting accidentally burned, I speak from experience. The bed is small but I guess that’s good so my partner and I can huddle together to stay warm. There are only big square euro pillows, which are not good for actually sleeping. I think the bed is too small to have 2 rectangular bed pillows, so I guess that’s why the hotel chose to use pillows that are typically reserved to decorative purposes. Earlier someone tried to unlock our door unsuccessfully, that didn’t leave us with a good feeling. The WiFi is spotty and has a weak signal. I have yet to use the shower, maybe it’s the best shower in all of Paris but I’m not holding my breath. The good thing is my partner and I have a really good sense of humour, our stay is playing out like a bad comedy movie.\n",

      "  review_body : I had a wonderful stay at Hotel de la Porte Doree. It's located minutes away from a metro stop and on a bus line that goes to two of the major train stations in Paris (Gare du Nord and Gare de L'est). It's on the eastern edge of the city away from the action but there is the beautiful Bois de Vincennes nearby and lots of little shops, bakeries, and eateries to explore. We stayed in a double superior room and while it's \"small\" for American standards, I found it to be good enough for our purpose. The room was comfy and brightly lit with natural light from a large window. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and more than willing to answer any questions and provide suggestions. Many thanks to Jerome and Sarah for being especially kind during our stay. My only complaint would be the breakfast buffet. We wished there was more variety and/or options. Other than that, I definitely recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to Paris and looking for luxury on a budget. You won't be disappointed.\n",

We arrived on a morning flight and they accommodated our baggage while we had lunch and got us into a room early. The room was a bit small as expected in an older building in Paris, but clean and comfortable and with enough floor space to lay out my exercise mat. Location was fine, just steps from Metro, restaurants, bank and even a laundromat close by. Breakfast was very good with a nice selection of breads, proteins (meats, cheeses, eggs, yogurt) and cereals, including several organic choices. We also appreciated the availability of coffee and ice water in the reception area throughout the day and ability to make coffee in our room. Wifi worked well. Very good value and will happily stay again if/when we can get back to Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : So just arrived home from a 3 day break in Paris staying at the de la porte doree.First things first is the negatives. This is not really what I would call a hotel, for British people this is more in line with a guest house than a hotel which gives you the negatives that come with it, no lobby area to convene and sit and also the rooms have very thin walls meaning you hear the rooms next to you (everything!) and you hear the train coming over every 20 minutes.Secondly its not really in a convenient location for a city center break. There isnt a touristy thing to do within 20 minutes on the tube, your a good 50minutes-1hour away from Disney and you cant reach anything without changing metro trains.That being said the rooms are nice, I like that they are trying to be a green hotel, BBC on the TV was a welcome positive on a night when we just wanted to chill out and the area has its own little positives with shops and bars around.Overall its a nice place to stay but I cant see me coming back if I went to Paris again.\n",

The hotel contacted me via email after booking to ask if there was anything I may need...and this helped the check-in process to be easy and quick. Check-out was also easyMy room was spotless and was kept that way my entire stay. The rooms are small, but, that is to be excepted in Paris. If you’re looking for a large room...be prepared to increase your spending budget.The elevator is tiny...and narrow. If you have minimal luggage and are not claustrophobic, you’ll be fine. If not, there are stairs.All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. I did not take breakfast in the hotel, so I can’t speak of that. The hotel is close to shops, restaurants and public transportation.The hotel is fairly quiet. You can hear guests in the hallway...but you cannot hear your neighbors in their rooms. However, I do caution, if you have a sensitivity to noise, give this place a pass. You can hear the metros rumble along all day + night as the property is located above the metro station.\n",

      "  review_body : I rarely stay at the same place twice, with Hotel de la Porte Doree being the exception. This was our third visit, and first with baby. Communication via e-mail was quick. Staff are friendly and efficient. We ended up in an executive double and found the room nicely decorated, large, spacious, and with a tub. They had a play pen, toys, and books ready in the room when we checked-in. There is a bottle of sparkling and flat left in the room daily. We had breakfast at the hotel on this trip and found good value as there were cheese, meats, fruit, juices, coffee, breads, and quiche....in a buffet setting. We still love the neighbourhood, but found the near by park a little worn down and in need of attention by the city. When taking transit to the local sites we liked to take line 6 as much as possible as it was above ground. One check-out we left our bags in the lobby, however this time they seemed more secure and locked the bags with bike locks, which was new from the last two times. I can not think of another option when going to Paris.\n",

This hotel is close to everything you have to use Metro but for the price you pay and room you get worth it.

It’s in a busy part of Paris sand comes with a lot of traffic noise nearby. The metro noise trundles by every few minutes and alongside cars and street noise meant that sleep was affected.

      "  review_body : My partner and I visited Paris this weekend for 2 nights and chose this hotel to stay. It's wonderfully located on the East District of Paris only metres from Dorree metro station. The hotel has a very boutique feel about it, even from the outside. We got there before check in and were able to drop our bags off and head into the City Centre. On our return that evening, we were pleasantly surprised by our room.The room itself was very compact, with a seperate toilet and shower room (the shower room was very tight - although I'm not the smallest of guys my petite wife also commented on it). The décor was very tastefully done managing to incorporate some of the original features. The bed was comfy but not necessarily to our taste. At home we have a low Japanese style bed so found it odd being high up. In addition the pillows were quite puffy and square in shape which again was just different to what we were used to. There were a few damages to the floor and the toilet annoyingly was too high off the floor.We didn't have breakfast there so are unable to comment. The coffee provided in the room wasn't great and there wasn't enough milk but not a deal breaker. I feel it only appropriate when reviewing a hotel you have to consider the star rating it is and the amount paid. That being said I think the rating of 4* is very reasonable. We enquired about upgrading the room which we were offered on our 2nd of 2 nights which was nice of them but thought it wasn't worthwhile. All in all, a lovely, reasonably priced hotel which I'd recommend friends to stay.Tip: 217 brasserie and Beyit Jedo were both fantastic and within walking distance of the hotel. Also the Metro can be heard, but they do provide ear plugs. If you don't live in a city, it may be an issue but for us it wasn't. \n",

However, during our stay we could not find any faults with the hotel at all and we had a great time! The room was fairly small but comfortable, clean and well decorated with a lovely modern ensuite bathroom. Despite the cold weather, the room was cosy and the adjustable thermostat came in very handy.Travelling to central Paris was easy on the metro using the ticket 'Mobillis' (€7.50 for unlimited one-day travel) and took approximately 25-30 mins to get to the Eiffel Tower or Arc de Triomphe. There was also plenty to do near the hotel - we were very impressed with the local boulangerie \"Vandermeersch\" and the bois de vincennes.All in all a very enjoyable stay :)\n",

A Metro station outside the hotel provides connections to any of the sights you want to visit. Some excellent restaurants on the main street, a huge park with boating lake 2 minutes away, and a zoo and aquarium just a short stroll away too. There is so much directly outside the Hotel, but of course you will want to visit the main sights too and the previously mentioned Metro is right on your doorstep for this.Some reviews mention noise from the Metro. We have never experienced this. We have experienced the fantastic breakfast, the very clean rooms, the very comfortable bed, and the excellent, professional, helpful service of the hotel staff.I am repeating what the other reviewers are saying, but maybe we should say nothing at all.....we should try to keep this place a secret to ourselves!\n",

One thing I can see travellers finding annoying is that the metro is directly underneath, however this did not annoy me in the slightest, since the earplugs were provided, and being on the 3rd floor it wasn't that noisy.Located in a lovely, tranquil area of the city - we felt safe walking around the area late at night in the dark even though we are both women.About 25 mins on the metro to the centre of the city, which isn't a problem. Every day we got the metro to 'Opera' where we then hopped on an 'Open Tour' bus, which is a company that has bus routes around the centre of the city, allowing you to see the sights and experience Paris, being able to get on and off whenever you wish to. Bus tickets can also be bought in conjunction with a boat pass which allows you to board a boat which takes you down the seine, and has several stops just like the bus ticket. Just a little insider tip, since we wasted €50 on a 1 day pass for the metro, however a 2 day pass was only around €20 euros for the bus and boat pass;)If I return to Paris, I will be coming to Hôtel de la Porte Dorée!\n",

      "  review_body : We loved the hotel, it is so cosy and comfortable. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the metro. I was well aware of its existence before booking but wasn't expecting it to be so loud, saying that my travelling companions weren't too bothered so maybe it is just me and by the 2nd and third night I wasn't so aware of it.We stayed in a triple room, room 39 on the ground floor, we had plenty room for the 3 of us. The beds are v comfortable and the added touches eg robes, slippers, welcoming cookies are a lovely touch. The bathroom is beautiful, however the bath is high for getting in and out of and hasn't an anti slip mat or a grab rail for older people which it could do with.My mother is elderly and wouldn't be able for the steps at the metro but the no 46 bus outside the door is wonderful, its very frequent and brought us to the hop on hop off bus and we were able to see parisians going about their business.The area felt very safe, plenty of resturaunts and convenience stores. A market across the road on sundays. Near a wonderful park.Would I stay here again? certainly it is a credit to the owners and their wonderful staff.\n",

Jerome and Vacine at the reception desk were welcoming and very helpful with navigating the metro, language pronunciations and places to eat. Located west of the city center, it is out of the mainstream but very convenient to all of Paris attractions using the metro. On our first day, we explored the neighborhood and found an open air market spanning several blocks with vendors of fresh produce, fresh fish, baked goods, cheese, meat and clothing. We liked both the Belle Mere and Tramway restaurants - both a short walk from the hotel. We would highly recommend this hotel based on overall value, hospitality, cleanliness and getting a true feel of a Paris neighborhood.\n",

      "  review_body : This was my fourth time to stay at Hotel Porte Dorée and once again I was not disappointed. We stayed August 11th thru 18th, 2017. Hotel staff helped us arrange taxi pickup from airport to hotel which was waiting for us upon our arrival. We arrived early in the morning so the hotel kept our luggage safe while we hit the ground running on our vacation. Check in was quick and simple when we returned exhausted late that evening and our room exceeded our expectations! Lovely spacious room on the top floor (thank goodness for the elevator!!) with comfortable bedding, generous towels, toiletries and a bottle of Champagne waiting for us. We had breakfast a couple of mornings at the hotel which was delicious and plentiful. The staff was always cheerful, kind and courteous no matter how early or late the hour. We have gotten to know Gopi and was happy to see his smiling face again this year. He always makes us feel at home!!! We love the Porte Dorée area. It is quiet, clean and we feel safe there. Metro and bus access on the corner so very easy to access anywhere you might want to go in Paris. The hotel also helped us arrange a shuttle to the airport for our trip home. I highly recommend Hotel Porte Dorée for your next Paris vacation. I'm hopeful I will see them again next year!!!\n",

It is very close to metro station (only 3meters away) and its very close to the expo center as well which is a big plus if you are visiting Paris for an exhibition. The only thing that needs improvement is the breakfast but not only in terms of quality but logistics as well. The breakfast room is very small and as a result if you try to have breakfast at rush-hours (9:00-10:00) most likely you wont find a table to sit and you will be standing in the line and feeling lucky.\n",

We stayed on the 3rd floor. The suite was big and excellent for our family of four (2 Adults and 2 Kids aged 13 & 8 years old), the stay was very comfortable and sleep quality was very good despite metro and RER line next to the hotel. Tram line 3A and Metro line 13 - Porte de Vanves station & bus stops are right across the hotel and it was excellent for us as we used only the public transport during our entire stay in Paris using Paris Visite travel card. Our stay was made more personalized and comfortable with provided amenities in the suite with microwave oven, kettle, Nespresso coffee machine etc, everyday complimentary Nespresso coffee capsules were a very pleasant surprise . Though not much of convenient stores and restaurants in the area, Porte de Versailles (Expo area) tram station is just 2 stops away with good choice of restaurants to pass a nice time for lunch or dinner. The included complimentary breakfast was good and tasty with good choice of breads, tasty croissant, good choice of yogurt and excellent coffee / hot chocolate. Our interaction with the staff was very minimal as all our requirements were well met. We would definitely stay back here during our next visit. I would have given a full rating for this property if not for very minimal issues ( like complimentary water not provided in the room on our 5th day, breakfast area is small and can get real congested and long time waiting for the tables to get cleared especially when you are with a family of 4 or more) - these are minimal issues which did not bother us much for which I had given a point less.. overall excellent stay at this property for us and would definitely recommend this for families.\n",

      "  review_body : I don't know what else you could want from a hotel. We stayed here for 4 nights this week during a last minute family trip to Paris. Thankfully its a little out of the city because the protests were on so the parts of the centre were closed but we were able to travel freely. We travelled with a child, she loved it. The beds are comfortable, rooms dark, clean and have everything you would need including a microwave and a kitchen sink and a really lovely shower. The little kitchenette saved us a fortune because we were able to nip over to the little market shop over the road and get some cheese and biscuits and just some light stuff so we didn't have to 'eat out' for lunch and dinner, we packed some sandwiches to take around the city with us so we didn't spend so much in the tourist traps. If I had to be critical I'd say - breakfast is lovely continental breakfast with everything you'd want but the same thing everyday. After 4 days I was a bit tired of the same thing - but happy to be fed good quality good at a reasonable price. The rooms are very quiet and I had read that some people were unhappy because they could hear the trains rumbling in their room (the downside of being so close to the metro) - we stayed in 408 and could hear the trains sometimes but this was because the room is generally so quiet but to be honest we're city people so it really didn't bother us. The room was very quiet. Gym was good, check in easy, bedding ok.\n",

The hotel was clean, modern and spacious.The kids stayed in small camp beds which were fine. We had a king. The bathroom was huge with a bath and very large shower. The only thing we disliked was the toilet ( which was separate ) had NO hand basin. So you had to walk the full length of the room to go into the bathroom to wash your hands after using the loo. Bizarrely there was two TVs in the same room.Breakfast was lovely, really good with fresh pastries, yogurt, cheese, eggs, coffee , fruit, chocolate juices and pancakes. The kids were in pancake heaven.Position was good. There was an underground station a few steps away making the train ride to all the sites easily accessible.A carrafour, patisserie and restaurants were all close by ( 2 min walk ).Highly recommended. We would return.Thank you to the hotel for our little treat as we checked in. Really appreciated.\n",

People keep saying it’s in a good location, it actually is not. You have to take a 20+ minute with changes metro anywhere. You also can’t just walk around outside your hotel because it’s not in a safe area, very dirty with lots of litter around.

The expectations and high Standard set by Accor Group were not met.The Decor and the look of the Hotel was modern and the Facilities inside the room were adequate.Barring a couple of Staff Members, others were Rude, Impolite and showed a Lack of Professionalism.The Room was Spacious enough to accommodate Separate Bedding for the Kids with Cartoon Character Inspired Bedding, Room Slippers and Eye Mask. That was the only Positive point of our Stay.Breakfast was served till 10 am only. Limited choice of Vegetarian Breakfast.The reason I am giving 3 Stars and not 1 Star is to Encourage and Motivate the Staff and the Management to provide a Superior Service to the Guests and make sure the Hotel Novotel Suites offers a Delightful Experience in the fabulous City of Paris.Location is bit far but well compensated by easy access to the Metro, Tram and Bus.Value for Money is Great for Families but lack of Courteous Staff made it a Regrettable choice.I would not return to this Hotel unless I Read Excellent reviews from Other Guests who Stay at this Hotel.\n",

We liked the location as buses take you to Saint Michel, Les Halles in 20 mins and the metro is at the hotel footsteps. The downside of it is the noise coming from trains that we could hear even though we were on the 9th floor. The staff are friendly and helpful. We asked for them to print out our tickets which they did. The beds are very comfy and quite big. Good bathroom but there is no washbasin in the toilets which is not very convenient nor hygienic.Breakfast was lovely: really tasty products: beautiful madeleines, buttery viennoiserie, selection of cheese, bread, yogurts,...I would go back again.\n",

The reason i am giving bed reviews for service cause they even i am check in online they are still asking my credit card. What the hell . Anyway . No worries there. In breakfast they didn't came even single time to take your used plates even once. ... we came at 11pm with family with infant & gate was closed so we put outlr keys outside of the door but key won't work so we have other rooms keys which also not working. So we are banging doors front desk RACHEL ( lazy lady ) can see us with family of 8 . & don't want to open door or help. Someone from guest seating on sofa stood up & open gate for us. OMG. What worst lady ever. & when we came inside she said i was on the phone . Even if she is on the phone she should hold the phone & help us cause we are with 4 kids including 2 infant . Even the internet is on & off not working good. This is my 1st bad reviews in my past 20 years of staying in hotel. Accors hotel is sucks here.\n",

It may be a little far away from the ''city centre'' , however nearby (20-100 metres away ) is a cornucopia of public transport that one can take to go straight to the city centre, to the airport, to versailles...As far as the hotel room is concerned, it is very convenient and offers usefull amenities such as a microwave oven, a refrigerator, 2 televisions and a big bathroom,ect.It was great being offered coffee capsules, water , tea and biscuits for free every morning.One is not being distracted by noices, since there is double glazzing.Lastly the reception and the staff was very helpfull and kind.I trully suggest this hotel for travellers who want to explore more than the city centre and would prefer for their stay to be in harmony , a little bit away from the too busy streets of paris - dont get this wrong its not that far away, its ideal and really close to the city centre by metro or even bus (bus 95 from the opera)-. But especially for families who need a little more space , the 30m2 hotels' rooms are more than convenient. \n",

Room was an adequate size for a Paris hotel, although pretty small.Good room design for such a small space with few drawbacks - separate toilet room but no sink to wash your hands, very high toilet bowl/seat (even for adults), no shelves at bathroom, and only one chair near the table.Hotel location is pretty far from the main tourist attractions, but metro station literally at doorsteps. Nice neighborhood with local bakery, pharmacy and laundromat just across the street. One negative thing that bothered me is that room windows cannot be opened and you have no control over room temperature (even that you have a climate control in the room - it's locked).The room became too hot and stuffy in nights .

      "  review_body : I'm staying here this week after a week in Novotel Porte D'Orleans a few km away. Of course I can't help but compare but these are quite different hotels. Novotel Suites doesn't have many of the facilities of its near neighbour: No restaurant, no full cooked breakfast. It's probably aimed more towards those who will be getting out an exploring Paris than the business traveller who wants everything in one place. That said, if you do want to stay in your room all week, the microwave and the nearby supermarkets certainly mean it's possible.The area is nothing special but it doesn't take much to stumble on some fantastic food in the neighbourhood. I ate at the Indochine on Rue De Dantzig tonight and it was terrific. The Timbre Poste nearby has a reputation of its own amongst my colleagues. And you can pretty much fall into the Metro if you want to head further afield.My first impression of the room was not great. There is a pullout sofa bed that was pulled out and badly made. As a single traveller I'm not sure why it hadn't been packed away and I ended up doing this myself. Similarly the towels weren't in the state I'd expect from a freshly turned hotel room. I've seen some other comments on here about the housekeeping but on returning to my room this evening it had been nicely made up.Once I'd packed the bed away I have to say the room is fine and in some ways preferable to many hotel rooms in Paris. There is floorspace to exercise in. The bathroom had all the facilities in one place. The bed can be curtained off from the sofa bed. Not everything makes sense - the tv is behind the sofa and not visible from the bed for example (although it is on wheels). Generally though the facilities are clean and the room feels fresh.The noise from traffic and trains is not unbearable from where I am. I certainly slept soundly last night. I can feel the rumble of the metro on occasion but it's not distracting.The restaurant in the lobby area is open and informal. A simple continental breakfast is available and there are plenty of interesting looking books to browse over breakfast. I like the easy informality of this hotel. Despite the niggles I've mentioned I will almost certainly stay here again. I'd definitely consider this hotel for a family trip because of the generously sized bedrooms.\n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I stayed four nights at this hotel. The website gives a reasonable representation of the hotel rooms - but the area around the hotel is not that special. It is next to a railway line and a nondescript boulevard. The positive point is the very spacious rooms - nearly palatial by Paris standards. A lot of people stay here with families and in our room there was a curtain to split the main bed from the sofa beds for the children. The downside however is that the main queen-size bed is quite small. I slept on the sofa bed which was Ok The hotel is not so easy to reach if you are coming from an airport (even though it is next to a metro station) . We came in via CDG , and we transferred at Montparnasse to get there via the metro. There were a lot of steps we had to take with our luggage - this may not be adequate for everybody. We flew out of Orly - there is a 37Euro fixed price for this aiport. You could theoretically take a taxi to Danfert Rochereau / RERB and then use Orlyval or Orlybus to save some money and avoid the metro steps We arrived quite late after 10PM and were happy that the brasserie / zinc accross the road (Marechal Brune) still served food . If you want to eat nearby , then walk in the direction of either the Plaisance or Convenant metro stations. The breakfast at 15€ is Ok but not better than an IBIS breakfast at 9.5€ when I stay for work in the IBIS near Basle. The rooms are sound proof - but I used my earplugs anyway to avoid the train noise in the early morning. For Paris , this hotel had good rooms and a very good price / quality ratio. I would stay here again\n",

You will have a hell of a night with train sound.It is very close to the underground metro station, so it is convenient to travel around. Service and attitude of the staff is extremely poor, way below the Novotel Europe Standard. Anything thing you request you always have to come down, there is no so such thing as room service in this hotel. Staff are also rude, we clearly mentioned that we wanted a noise-free room, but we were given the room facing the railways. Which was terrible and disrupted our sleep for 2 nights. They did not allow us to even change rooms and simply shut us down.They do not want to provide in room slippers as well, the staff in the reception said our room is not an expensive room, so no slippers.Above all, breakfast was even more worst. Same food items is repeated daily. Variety is also very less. More importantly, it does not even look like a dining area, it is so small and cramped. I strongly do not recommend to stay here.If you are looking for hotels, i recommend citadines saint germain-des-pres paris, for the same price and its located in a prime location.\n",

First why we choose Novotel basically cause they give you a family room with same price of regular double room price. .. in addition to double sofa bed for kids ... that's not all but also kids eat free (of course if you have a meal plan).I was worried only from the location as it is a bit away from attractions center, but it turned out to be a perfect location! The hotel itself looks new and modern, cleanliness was fine, front desk and staff were really kind and helpful. The only thing that if you need some extras like plates, forks. .. , you've to go down and fetch yourself. The room itself was good, a bit tight but cozy. . The only downside -as many complained- that toilet is separated from the bathroom. The bathroom has a good space combining both tub & shower (I would say if they provide only one of them there would be a nice space for toilet inside the bathroom)Now back to location: it's really -letterly- true that the metro at door step! (Metro line M13) and a few meters away there's also a tram stop (no. 3 & 3a) Port de Vanves is name of stop for both. It's almost 20 mind. away from most of famous Paris attraction and Mr. Google Maps will professionally guide your way.And here you find all you need around you, restaurants, grocery, bakery laundary, cafes, barbershop, .... and many more only you need to cross the road! And not to mention you pay like a local!Some people copmlined about the noise from the trains, to be honest I could hardly notice it (knowing that I'm really such sensitive to such noises)Our stay was including the breakfast l and it was good (small, simple and not too many varieties but it was good enough to fuel for long day)Overall we liked our stay there and we really recommend it for families, and for sure if we get the chance to come back we will happily do it.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at this hotel for one night. The rooms are very large for Paris and nicely appointed, lovely bathroom, no toiletries provided, which didn't bother me. Bed was very comfortable with nice linen and lovely towels. The only downside is that the hotel is right on the train line and the rumble from the trains is rather disturbing. We were on the 3rd floor so my tip is to ask for a higher floor facing the road .The room has a kettle and coffee machine, Nespresso pods. And herbal teas.It is good value at about 100 euros a night. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but went to the Boulanger opposite and had the most Delicious almond croissant and coffee. Definitely worth a visit.\n",

We called, emailed and contacted numerous times the hotel and mostly they ignored us. I have contacted them see if we could move the stay, get a part refund or credit due to the situation and they basically told us to go away. I appreciate rules but the hotel we were stuck in went above and beyond to help us. Novotel Suites Paris Expo Porte de Versailles did NOTHING. Disgusting and this means I will now avoid this chain for business or personal. Takes NOTHING for a multi million $ company to do something small.\n",

      "  review_body : We have had the most amazing stay here over Christmas. A charming boutique typically Parisian hotel right in the heart of it all.I have travelled with my daughter who is in an electric wheelchair and we had equiptment delivered to the hotel.I knew this was a typical Parisian hotel, that's what I wanted. Via phone calls and emails, Victor and Suzan who were were so efficient, they arranged everything perfectly, even a taxi to collect us. Customer service at its finest. We even had a room with a balcony that looked onto the Eiffel tower. So beautiful to wake up to and watch lit up and sparkling on in the evening.15 mins walk away to the Tower and the Arc de triomphe. Perfect destination. Surrounded by restaurants, bars and supermarkets.The room was typically Parisian but a fair size. Comfortable beds, mini bar stocked with treats if needed.Such a clean hotel with polite, friendly, helpful and courteous staff.Breakfast was your typical continental. Be warned, the smell of fresh baking croissants will wake you, so lovely ❤️ We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, we would DEFINITELY return. If you are reading this now wondering whether to book, then you must.Suzan, thank you for being amaxing. Victor too. All the staff here went above and beyond. I can't recommend this hidden treasure enough. Thank you so much for making Christmas so memorable for both of us \n",

Howeever the friendly staff let us put our big luggage bags in a secure and locked room behind the check in desk which was amazing. We then had the option to walk around the Champs Elysees for a bit. The location of his hotel is amazing. It is walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de triomphe and is located next to amazing hotels and restaurants. There is also a convenient bus stop down the road. The hotel breakfast is not free at the time of our stay but was amazing. The options were not exactly huge like you would experience at a Hilton or Marriot but they tasted amazing. Featured all types of cold cuts, crepes, bakery times, yoghurt, juices, fruits etc. The rooms were not that big but they were nonetheless clean and modern. Overall this was an excellent option for a 3 night stay and i will for sure return here. The best thing about this hotel was the excellent location and the friendly staff/\n",

We could not believe how small this room and the bathroom was. The window opened up to a dark tunnel of ugly concrete walls of other buildings.We had just checked in after a long flight from the USA and were in the room about 20 minutes when a staff member just walked right in on us. No knock at the door, nothing. When I asked why, she said she was just checking in on us. Weird.We could not get the safe to work and all of the staff that we came across at the front desk were rude and unhelpful as far as recommendations or directions go.Without a doubt, we would not stay here again.\n",

      "  review_body : The overall experience was no more than average at best. We have both done a fair amount of international travel, so we are familiar and totally fine with smaller hotel rooms from time to time. That being said, this room was very small (bathroom as well). The location is good as you can walk to many locations you would want to see in Paris and walking out of the hotel to see the Eiffel Tower is definitely a plus. That being said, the red flag for us was coming back to a room door that was left open by the cleaning crew. The room door must have not shut all the way as they left the room (innocent mistake), however obviously many of our belongings were in the room all day and this could’ve been a bad situation for us. When we brought this to the attention of hotel staff, the response was less apologetic and more “well good thing nothing happened”. Overall it served it’s purpose as a place to sleep but don’t expect much else. \n",

My only complaint is there was a sign, that said if you hang your towels the hotel will not wash your towels as a means of saving water. We hung up our towels each day, but were still given new towels daily. We are extremely eco conscious, and wanted to reuse our towels. Please do not urge visitors to save water, if the house keeping isn't going to take it seriously. There were environmental protests during our stay, so its ironic the hotel wasn't helping to instill good environmental habits.\n",

Was abit disappointed with the room as we had high expectations but were given a ground floor disabled room, neither me or my boyfriend are disabled. Also the key was very old fashioned (it was an actual key) and had trouble opening the door multiple times which I can only assume to be a result of the old lock? It was disappointing as we had requested a room with a view as it was our anniversary but I understand most people will want a view and it is hard to supply everyone. Also we noticed on arrival that we, as british people, had to pay more city tax than the spanish people who were checking in before us? i’m unfamiliar with the law so that might be legitimate but we was quite confused. However the man on reception was very friendly and extremely bilingual, he switched to your language whenever you came into contact.

The front desk staff bent over backwards to help with anything they could, we even happened to be there on the day they swapped out all the mattresses in the hotel and they even did everything they could to make sure we weren’t bothered by it. The location can’t be beat. It’s a quick walk to the Eiffel Tower and the Arc is at the end of the street. Restaurants and grocery stores (we needed to get some bottles of water) are all over. Overall a really good experience staying there. \n",

The rooms are clean and pretty spacious, we were four girls with four pretty huge luggages. The bathroom is big, with a bath tub, shower gel and lots of towels. The only thing I can say that I think they should work on is their breakfast which is the same every day, low in options and not that good (i even found a couple of things that were past their expiration date).

      "  review_body : The hotel is in a great location with the eiffel tower, arc de triomphe and champs elysee all a short walk away. You can see the eiffel tower from out the front of the hotel and we requested a room with views of the eiffel tower which the hotel happily accommodated. The room we had (412) was small but clean and adequate enough with tea and coffee making facilities, a chargeable mini bar, hair dryer, a safe and good array of toiletries in the bathroom. Breakfast is good, cereals, toast and pastries with teas and coffees - however the only small complaint I have is the way the breakfast hall is maintained. The first morning we went down to breakfast there were only 3 tables occupied but all the others had breakfast plates etc left out on them waiting to be cleared, the milk was warm on the side, there were no pastries, juice, cheese or meats left out and we struggled to find any jams as all the ones on the tables had been taken and not refilled - there was noone around to ask in the dining hall and with half hour still left of breakfast we found this frustrating. Eventually a lady came out and restocked the croissants so we just had these and left. However the second day was the complete opposite and everything was freshly stocked and plenty of tables - perhaps just luck of the draw when you go down and only a small and very minor complaint on an otherwise great stay. We found all the staff we encountered to be extremely helpful and welcoming, ordering a taxi for us when needed etc. Once we had checked out and nearly got to the train station in our taxi I realised I had left my engagement and wedding rings on a table in the bar - one quick phone call to the hotel and they assured me it had been handed in safely and we quickly went back to collect it - we are very grateful for the guest who handed it in and the reception staff for keeping it safe for me. Overall we had a lovely stay and would return to this hotel next time we are in Paris. Thank you for a pleasant stay.\n",

      "  review_body : I give them 1 Star because I can't give them 0 Stars! Please read this entire review. Let me start by saying my wife and I have celebrated a 33rd birthday, a 50th birthday, our engagement, and our honeymoon with this hotel (all separate trips to Paris). When we returned after a 10 year hiatus in 2017 to celebrate our anniversary and a honeymoon redux, what a shock! The lobby is the same worn out version it was 10 years ago. After communicating with them about the occasion, the staff could really care less. We had hoped for a specific room we used to stay in but were given a tiny, hot room above the floor we wanted. Their excuse was, those rooms were now \"family\" rooms. They now cater to families. They don't care about repeating guests who have built a special bond with them. The lovely little breakfast room in the basement has become a dining hall for families. The little romantic table under the stairwell is now a bathroom... Our room was hot, tiny, and had an excuse for a shower that was so small, the knob would move from cold to hot because there is no room for a person to turn around! We had planned to return to the hotel (as we did in 2007) after touring Normandy (we had a reservation for an additional 3 nights) and had reservations for our favourite restaurant on the actual date of our anniversary, the first night back to Paris.We were in Fécamp on the morning of our return to Paris (and our actual anniversary date) when we received a notification of our room's cancellation at the Hotel Elysees Union!! FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY! I called the hotel and they didn't have the guts to admit they did it! Booking dot com didn't understand what had happened and helped us find a replacement, The Hotel Duret that I highly recommend!! This was the most expensive hotel we stayed in during our entire trip to France and was by far the worst hotel we've ever experienced. Stay away from this poor excuse of French \"hospitality\". You can do far better.\n",

The location is great, 10 minute walk from both the Arc du Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower just off Avenue Kleber. All the staff were so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We had a two bedroom apartment on the top floor and it was ideal for our family of five, including three teenagers. The room was really clean and comfortable with two TV's, two bathrooms and a small kitchen area with a fridge, dishwasher and washer/dryer. Breakfast was included and filled us up before a day's sightseeing, there was an excellent selection of cold meats, pastries, fruit and cereals. Sylvie made sure there was a table for everyone and was always cheerful and friendly. We were let down by our return transfer to the airport and reception sorted it out in five minutes, keeping us calm and arranging an alternative taxi. I have to give special thanks to Suzan on reception who was amazing when my husband realised on the plane home that he had left his wallet in the room safe. I telephoned her when we got back to England and she found the wallet and posted it back to us within a couple of days. It really was a great hotel and I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n",

      "  review_body : Visited this hotel back in May, really good location, many restaurants/bars near by. Got what we paid for, would stay here again. They were happy to lock our bags up after we checked out until we were ready to leave for the airport. Customer service: Really good, staff were lovely.Food:Breakfast was 10 euro a day each, really good traditional french breakfast, thoroughly enjoyed. Room:Was only downside as very small, was just the two of us so was fine, bathroom had a thin sliding door so not a lot of privacy. Windows not very private so kept curtains closed. Location:Perfect, we walked everywhere as taxis were crazy expensive, way more than we expected. There's a bar literally across the street, expensive but good.\n",

The room is large, the bed very comfortable, they have a nice tub in the bathroom, and there are plenty of good restaurants nearby. The entire staff is amazing, speaking several languages, fast to answer to any needs, from the luggage storage to providing wine glasses and bottle opener in the middle of the night. :-)) Special thanks to Pablo, who not only was helpful, but entertained us with good humor and cultural exchanges.

We had breakfast and found this a good price, you would pay 10 euros easy for what we had. We were a bit worried about the area, but to be honest it was a really good location. We were five minutes from Moulin Rouge and felt fine walking home at 1am. The room was clean and adequate for our needs with lovely balcony doors. I would not recommend the location with children but as a couple in search of nights out with pubs and restaurants it was perfect. It is also only two train stops from the eurostar and only cost 7 euros to get here from guard du Nord. We also found it easy on the trains to get to the Eiffel tower. Can't wait to visit again soon.

      "  review_body : My husband and I stayed for three nights in a “Superior Double Room” at the Libertel Montmartre Opéra in May 2017. The room was fairly simple and small, but we weren’t in Paris to hang out in a hotel room (and I’m hoping you aren’t either). It was clean and the bed was comfortable, which was what we cared most about. Our room on the sixth floor (which people from the United States would call the seventh) had a view with the Eiffel Tower, which was pretty cool. My sister-in-law was staying on a lower floor (I think the third or fourth) and had a bit of noise from the street below, but we did not have a problem on the sixth. The hotel is in a good location, less than two blocks from the Pigalle Metro Station (three quick stops from Gare du Nord, if you are coming in from CDG), right by the foot of Montmartre. Pigalle itself is a bit seedy, just a heads up if that kind of thing is an issue for you, though I’ve heard it used to be a lot raunchier. All in all though this was a good mid-range lodgings option for us.\n",

It's not a problem if you spend your day visiting Paris and just use the room for the night.The noise insulation is poor with noise being heard from the street below although we were on the second floor. This woke us up on a couple of occasions (plus traffic noise).The breakfast choice is average with no hot dishes (e.g. omelette or scrambled eggs, bacon etc.). There are only two choices of meats throughout the stay. However, coffee is really good, there is plenty of pastry, cereal, yogurt, jam so it depends what you prefer. Food quality is good, diversity seems to be the issue.\n",

      "  review_body : I loved my stay here. A lot of people say the hotel rooms are small. I know I was booked for the smallest size room available, so unless I was upgraded without being told, I thought the room was very spacious and extremely clean. Even the bathroom was spacious and very modern looking. I was so happy with the room. There's space, comfortable bed, nice reading lights and outlets right by the bed, a large TV, free coffee/tea in the room. The one problem with the hotel is the thin walls. It can be very distracting as you can hear quite a bit. Honestly though, this wouldn't deter me from staying here again. The location is amazing! Just down the street from Pigalle metro and a ten minute walk from Sacre Coeur. Also up the street is the famous Moulin Rouge. I am a twenty something year old female who traveled alone and felt totally safe in this part of town, even at night. There are so many amazing restaurants within a five min walk from the hotel (some even right across the street). I would book this hotel for my next stay in Paris without question!!\n",

It is in the red light district of Paris, however don't let that put you off as a few minutes walk and you are in the artistic part of town.The staff are friendly and the hotel is modern. However the rooms are very compact, not much personal space if you are part of a couple. Also the sound travels through the walls, our room had adjoining bathrooms on either side so when our neighbours took a shower we had to listen to the continual cascade of water against the wall. Also the lift makes a jingling sound and this carries through the floor. You can generally hear neighbours talking, especially if they are naturally fairly loud.\n",

It is a walk away from the main street of moulin rouge where you can find many restaurants. Great access to numerous train stations(Pigalle, Blanche). If you are an adventourous person it is walking distance to many popular sites such as the Gallarie Lafayette etc. The room is very comfortable and I love the design. I booked the comfort room which was quite small but very cosy. I was the only person in the room so the space and size was perfect. There are different room options depending on the amount of people and they are all reasonably priced for the location of the hotel. Just a slight feedback, improvement with the breakfast options would be good as it was limited (mainly bread, yoghurt, fruit, cheese, ham and cereal) but for the price of this 3 star I cant complain. I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely book again. Tip: it is best to book this hotel on the direct website as they have the best price deals and offers.\n",

      "  review_body : When I booked the hotel I did not expect too much as it was so cheap. However, when I arrived I was surprised how nice the hotel itself and the room was. The room was small but what else would you expect in an old city like Paris. It was a treat to be able to have not one but two full length doors to open up and let in the fresh air. I was not expecting to even have one. The room was clean and smelled fresh and the bathroom was lovely. The bed was comfortable and so were the pillows. The location for the hotel is great. It is close to the metro via Pigalle, Blanche, or Place de Clinchy. I enjoyed being able to walk most places and explore the lovely streets and cafes in the area and then just take the metro back after a full day of walking and exploring. The area is full of little cafes and bars so it is quite loud, but again, you're in Paris, you're in a city... it will be loud. I only have two minors cons to this hotel. 1) The outlets in the room are in odd locations and none near a mirror. So it was hard to get ready. 2) The walls are extremely thin and when housekeeping starts in the morning you can literally hear everything going on in the next room. I would recommend this hotel to others and if I was back in Paris I might stay in this hotel again. Keep in mind when booking this hotel... it is near the Moulin Rouge, there are loads of adult entertainment venues and shops. It doesn't affect the integrity of the hotel I just thought it would be worth a mention. With this though, it is close to the cute Montmartre neighbourhood which is full of cobbled streets, cafes, coffee shops, galleries, and quaint buildings.\n",

I simply love the comfortable bed and with the wonderful air conditioning, it was really nice to be snuggling under the nice cozy covers in bed.

The cleaning staff did a fantastic job and were lovely when we spoke.Our room (21) was a simple double room, but had a nice clean bathroom, air conditioning (not silent but heated well, it was cold outside!). USB sockets, as well as UK and normal EU sockets. TV as well as a tablet with Netflix too, very nice touch!Downstairs the bar and lounge is a relaxing space and the complementary tea, coffee etc. Make it a nice relxed and comfortable space to work from during a longer stay if needed.Would give the staff 6 stars if possible.Considering the absolutely tragic state of travel in Paris right now, this was a truly wonderful stay and I can't thank the team enough.\n",

We found it based on Trip Advisor reviews, so we want to thank reviewers for helping us find this gem!The ambiance and decor give it a typical Parisian feel, and there is free coffee, tea and often croissants in the lobby throughout the day. It is so nice to plan your route, chat or read and soak in the atmosphere over a croissant and coffee in between adventures!The staff is absolutely lovely and speaks English, so we really felt it’s a home away from home. Staff feels genuine, authentic and very helpful. I forgot a stuffed rabbit, a special gift from a friend in my room, and they are sending it to me in the US!We loved the free breakfast, with typical and amazing bread and cheese, eggs, yogurt, fresh squeezed juices and other items (there are also cold cuts, but we don’t eat pork, so we didn’t try them). And it is practical to receive a free bottle of water daily.We had two different rooms because we extended our stay, and we found the king room much more comfortable and spacious for two people. So we recommend the small upgrade if you are not traveling alone. But even the small room was very functional: we loved the huge shower-head that feels like you are in a waterfall, USB charging stations, comfortable beds and the fact that we had a safe. We also loved the location of the hotel. It’s in a diverse Parisian neighborhood outside of the tourist area, which for us is a plus since we like to get an authentic experience. But yet, it’s located between three Metro stops on different lines, so that it’s really easy to get to all of the sights. We used mostly Couronne station on the blue line. There are plenty of stores and restaurants in short walking distance too.I could not recommend this hotel more. Pricing is also very reasonable for what is offered.\n",

However, we soon changed our minds! Our room was on the 6th floor (luckily there’s a tiny lift) and was very quiet. It looks like it’s recenly been renovated and everything looked clean and new with a somewhat quirky decor. The bed was huge and really comfortable, bathroom was functional and modern (although the towels were a bit small/thin). Breakfast was a welcome surprise - decent choice and variety of dishes (including couscous?!), and you could get hot drinks and bottled water at all times. Staff really helpful and friendly. Location is good, although some may find it a bit grungy. It’s not far from Pere Lachaise cemetery and close to buses/Metro stops, not far from Chinatown and le Marais district.

When we first arrived, I was concerned that I had booked a hotel a little too far off the beat and path...but the location is great. Just on the edge of the Marais District...hop on the 96 bus just around the corner,,,and in a funky area of Paris where the locals...and tourists...hang our at night. We booked this hotel based on the positive reviews we read and it was great value! Would love to return and stay here again! Thank you to Ijlal and you wonderful staff.\n",

The rooms were charming, clean and comfortable, breakfast (and especially their Sunday brunch) was delicious, and the staff was exceptionally helpful and kind. The hotel is located pretty far away from the major tourist sites (Montmarte, Champs Elysses, Tour d’Eiffel) which I preferred. There were no crowds of tourists and there was an abundance of reasonably-priced, authentic restaurants and cafes near the hotel. Plus, it’s only a 5 minute walk to the metro if you need to get around.\n",

The rooms are new, neat, very clean, with nice design touches and good overall aesthetics. The “good good” room which we chose was bright and spacious and I would say that in reality it was better than the pictures. Both our bedroom and bathroom had windows to the street (no noise though) and natural ventilation which was a very pleasant surprise. The breakfast is simple with good indredients but had everything we need. Throughout the day you can have a cup of coffee or tea in the lounge area which made us really feel at home. Staff was very friendly and willing to help us go around Paris. We were really very pleased of our stay and wouldn’t ask for something more. The location is also convinient since it’s close to Marais for strolling/shopping and the metro and bus stations are very close, which can take you directly to the center. \n",

The coffee and tea is complimentary all day and the breakfast pastries are left out after breakfast to be used up free of charge. A very nice touch.The lift is tiny...three people max or two with luggage.

Initially it was booked because of the close proximity to my daughter, and because she they walked by it a number of times and said it looked nice. However it turned out to be so much better than expected. The staff was absolutely wonderful! They were very friendly and very helpful, always greeting us with a smile. We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready, but were invited to spend time in the breakfast/lounge area which was so very appreciated since we were exhausted from travel. I doubt they know how much I appreciated that kindness. The breakfast/lounge area has a very cool jazzy vibe, we loved the decor. I booked the middle type of room and it was quite spacious and comfortable for the two of us. One very nice thing is the built-in USB ports on each side of the headboard. Oh and the heated bathroom floor was a great feature too! I never did get to ask the staff though, how to turn on the overhead rainshower. We could not figure it out and had to use the hand-held shower head. Not a deal-breaker but just strange. The breakfast as other reviewers mention was very good, and the coffee machine is available 24-7 for great coffee/espresso, etc. Overall I would definitely stay there again!\n",

      "  review_body : I was pleasantly surprised by some of the nice touches by this budget friendly hotel. The hotel is located about 5 mins from a metro stop in an ethnically diverse neighborhood and felt very safe. Lots of variety of food selections and no lack of convenience stores. I’m very averse to noise so was very glad I got a room on the highest floor - 6th level.Nice touches - recently remodeled, great bed & sheets, 3 rooms in my “wing” were sealed by a door so had good buffer from elevator & stairwell noises, in room AC/heat control that was really quiet, great bed & sheets, roomy shower (no tubs) with modern fixtures, ample hot water, unlimited water bottles available in a fridge on first floor & breakfast included. The two slanted windows were functional which is great to let out steam from a hot shower. Best of all - heated tile floor in the bathroom. Can’t tell you what a luxury that is.Few things to consider - because I chose the top floor, one side of the ceiling was slanted (common for Paris buildings). For taller people, there’s a good chance of knocking your head. It also made for a tricky entry into the shower. The room size was sufficient for one person - could be tight for two. No closet - an open rack to hang clothes which was fine for me. No balcony nor outdoor space (the windows do open). The tiniest elevator - big enough for 3 average sized people standing side by side or 1 person with a large suitcase.Things to improve - the towels were really rough. For a hotel that has been thoughtful about most things, this was glaring. The little safe hanging on the wall was really tiny. I have a combo passport/check book holder & couldn’t fit it in even when I tried to put it in slanted.\n",

      "  review_body : One of the things I love about travel is learning. At this hotel I learned that being greeted by a friendly, personable and helpful guy at check in is not a guarantee that the entire experience will be wonderful. I learned that a clean and well kept room is important but also that style does matter. I learned that two eight inch square plywood boxes attached to the wall are not my idea of storage. I learned that a pegboard on the wall with a few sheets of paper hanging from it is not a replacement for a book about hotel services. I learned that a 6X4 inch safe will not hold my laptop. I learned that in Paris, a city I love, it is possible to get a truly terrible croissant and cafe creme. I suppose I may have learned that industrial chic just doesn't work for me. Worst of all for me was when the breakfast room suddenly got very cold and smoke filled. I walked over to the front door to see two front desk employees standing in the open doorway smoking. It was 35 degrees (3 celsius). I very calmly mentioned that the room was getting cold. I will long remember the look of utter contempt on the face of the woman who only two hours later was the person I went to in order to be checked out of the hotel. If none of these things seem like problems to you, then you will probably enjoy this hotel much more than I did.\n",

      "  review_body : We selected this hotel as the location was walking distance from our son who lives in Belleville. The quality of the breakfast was excellent and the room spacious enough- the bathroom was particularly generous.There is 24/7 access to tea and coffee plus a free bottle of water daily.The owner/ manager was extremely responsive when he became aware of a problem with our lighting and made a gesture of recompense which was appreciated.The nearby Rue Oberkampf is an interesting mix with plenty of restaurants, music venues and varied cultures. A bit like Sydney’s King St Newtown. The street that the hotel is in is what I would call a ‘gentrifying’ area. No doubt the residents in the other ‘hotels‘ in the street that look more like boarding houses will soon be pushed out.A twenty minute/half hour stroll takes you right into the Marais.Would definitely stay here again.\n",

The Continental Breakfast was also excellent - all high quality, although one morning they were caught out by a lot of people arriving at the same time and some food and plates etc temporarily ran out. I would add that we were surprised there was no safe in the room; a safe would normally be expected in a three star hotel these days.

Even on reporting that the temperature control panel was faulty, at least twice to reception staff throughout our weekend stay, it was not fixed & we were not furnished with any explanation as to why it remained faulty.This made for a very uncomfortable nights sleep, which didn’t contribute to a restful weekend.Especially as to counter balance to this -our only solution was to open the sound proof windows to the noisey street outside.

      "  review_body : The fairy tale at the website of the Scarlett hotel in Paris is incomplete and incorrect. Take the ‘Superior Twin’ (we stayed in room 801) it may be large enough for Sleepy Dwarf and his mate, however not for two grown-ups. The beds are just 1.80 m long, equipped with a single mattress and a 100% synthetic (sweaty) duvet. The bathroom is only as wide as twice the lavatory bowl. And there is no elevator for the rooms at the back of the hotel. These are solely accessible through a rather narrow steepish staircase (likewise fire escape!) Like canned sardines guests can have a convenience self-service breakfast in the tiny room behind the reception. All ingredients are efficiently packed as single portions in disposable (plastic) packaging. You’ll be better off at the real bakery just around the corner.We love fairy tales, not lying stories, accompanied by false evocative, dressed up wide-angle shots. For decades we visit Paris several times a year and stayed in quite a few hotels. We know by now what level of facilities you may expect for your money. For the Scarlett we have paid € 192.00 for one night, including breakfast, far too much for the poor standard of this accommodation.\n",

This was my first time staying at this hotel, though, and it was great. The rooms are the standard small size for Paris (it's worth upgrading to a \"superior\"), but they have just been renovated and everything is new. Some rooms over look the street (it's around the corner from the main street but it was still fairly noisy) and some have windows that just face the room a few metres away. So I think it depends on the room you get. The breakfast was good, with some eggs, meats, and all the usual pastries. We didn't find a good breakfast spot in the neighbourhood that wasn't just a pastry and coffee, so we stayed here for breakfast each morning. The staff are really great: friendly, helpful and really wanted to please guests. We really appreciated them!\n",

      "  review_body : First thing that needs addressing is given that this hotel is in Paris you have to accept the rooms are on the small side that being said for the two of us the space never really became an issue as we only had one bag etc. The area that hotel scarlett is a tad \"urban\" but that being said neither of us felt unsafe returning to the hotel late at night. The location is a distance out from the main sites of Paris for example the hotel to the eiffel tower is 37mins using public transport or 1hour 40mins on foot so even though the hotel is reasonable you also have to factor in the cost of constant metro journeys or the time you will spend walking to where ever you want to be. The only issues we had with the room is the lack of air conditioning, it has air conditioning but when i mentioned it not working the staff said its currently on heat rather than cool as they thought it wasn't warm well it certainly was warm which leads on to the next issue our room overlooked the road therefore it was seldom quiet and trying to sleep with the windows open was impossible. I'm not sure if I would return to the Hotel Scarlett due to the distance from the main sites that being said you cant ignore the massive price difference between this hotel and the hotels close to the sites.\n",

The neighborhood is alive and diverse, the food options plentiful and fabulous from cheese plates and wine to the best dumplings I have ever tasted. It is a lived in neighborhood now inhabited by a young energetic crowd. The park is lovely. 2 metro stops are steps away but roaming out of Belleville by foot gets you to other wonderful neighborhoods. The hotel itself is clean and cool and the bed and shower were fabulous, great staff. Still affordable. Will be back soon!\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel was a great value and a fantastic experience in a wonderful little corner of Paris. The rooms were stylish, modern, and luxurious. Our room had everything we needed despite being quite compact. Front desk service was outstanding and they even brought ice up to the room upon my request. The hotel is right between Parc des Buttes-Chaumont and Parc de Belleville, both of which are beautiful. It was very convenient to both bus and metro lines, and had great restaurants nearby. It’s in a non-touristy part of Paris, which makes it feel so much more real. I saw a review that complained about there not being an elevator and wanted to respond. There are two wings of the hotel. One has four floors and has an elevator, and the other wing without an elevator only has two floors. Most people would be able to carry their bags up one flight of stairs, but it’s true this would not be an accessible hotel to those using a wheelchair. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would return!\n",

      "  review_body : I absolutely hated hotel scarlett, but I really blame myself for trying to save a few bucks.Given that it is summer and high season and the room was way less than $150 euro a night, what was I expecting?First, the good. I love, love, love the 20th. it is rough and raw and edgy and full of crazy characters and artists' ateliers--so different from the manicured blandness of the 6th. Hotel Scarlett is literally next door to my favorite restaurant in Paris and spitting distance from le grand Bain, another on my top ten list. there is also an amazing wine store/bar right across the street that has an huge selection of unusual and well priced bottles and hosts quite a party scene every night. our shower was powerful and hot. the towels were huge and thirsty. and the bed was quite comfortable. (I loved the custom woven hotel scarlett design, but I did have to question why they used so much of their design budget on that when we were given a tiny sliver of soap for a five day stay and it was not replaced even when it melted into nothing -- we literally had to go to the front desk to beg for more.) Sadly, the list of what I didn't like is far longer. first, there is no elevator. and though the check in vaguely offers to help you with your bags, I really didn't believe the clerk had any interest in carrying my giant suitcase up the curvy and difficult staircase. the wallpaper in the hallway is tatty, ripped and stained in multiple places. in the morning, hotel staff leave cleaning equipment and bags of linens at the foot of the stairs, not only in clear sight of guests, but I literally had to climb over them to get out of the hotel. our bathroom door was scuffed and filthy, the ceiling in the shower had huge sections with peeling paint (yuck) and every towel I used had makeup stains on it. the led light next to my bed flickered on and off our whole stay making me wonder if anyone checks the rooms ever. don't forget the soap. the teensy tiny piece of soap they gave us to last five days for two people. and then there was the noise. this place is noisy. the walls are so thin you can hear everything that happens in the hallway and in other rooms. worse, our room had a window to an enclosed courtyard so everything echoed making a little rainstorm sound like the end of the world and a family eating breakfast like a school full of children after too much birthday cake. but the worst was the air conditioning. we'd get the room nice and cool before bed (it was hot and humid during our stay) and in the middle of the night, it would just go off. my husband would get up and tinker with it and it would get cool again, and then a few hours later it would go off again. at first, I thought maybe we'd just reached the set temperature, but when I found myself literally dripping in sweat under the covers, I realized either it was broken or the system was rigged to turn off no matter the room's temperature.I was hoping for a sweet little design hotel, well priced because it is in one of the least expensive neighborhoods in Paris, something like mama shelter, but I found hotel Scarlett to be more like a hostel in quality and service level. I thought the cleanliness was iffy. and when at checkout, the clerk actually counted my total owed on her fingers, I realized the staff was, well, a little green, which explained a lot.\n",

      "  review_body : My girlfriend and I spent three nights here in March, and had a wonderful stay. I arrived 4 hours before the check in time, just off the red-eye and was pleasantly surprised when they were able to check me in and give me a room with no prior notice. The room was just as advertised, with a few minor issues. Some of the lights didn't work, and the bathroom door didn't latch. But the biggest issue was that we could hear nearly everything in the small staircase just outside. We were lucky to have quiet other guests around us, but I can imagine that being a larger issue with different people staying nearby. All of the staff were very professional and very friendly, especially given that I speak very little French. It is located in a charming neighborhood with a nice grocery store next door and a short walk from the Pyrénées metro station. The bread shop right next to the metro entrance and the metro cafe nextdoor were also wonderful. I'd highly recommend Hotel Scarlett to anyone looking for a less-touristy place to stay in Paris, and am incredibly grateful to the staff there for making our trip wonderful!\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed 4 days here and it was almost perfect. The hotel is located in a quiet and safe residential area at 5 minutes walk from Pyrenees subway station. There are a lot of good bars, restaurants and supermarkets near the place. The room was small, cleaned daily, the bathroom was modern and quite spacious. The first day, there was an awful smell in the bathroom( sewer like) but after we spoke with the guy from the Reception they solved it immediately. The WiFi was great except the last evening. You can have continental breakfast but you have to order it the day before( 14 euros). The lobby and dinning area are very nice and relaxing, they have books, drinks and you can also play backgammon. For smokers it's a special outside place near the Reception. There is a plus that the hotel has an elevator because the stairs are quite narrow. The staff was nice and helpful. If you want to stay in a non touristic area this hotel is a perfect choice.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at Hotel Scarlett last week; pretty easy to get to via the Métro. It is easier to get to via Pyrénées than Belleville because you walk downhill from Pyrénées. Ask for the building with the elevator or you will have a good leg workout. Bathroom layout is a little weird for two people; it is very narrow but we made it work. Room was very clean and quiet. Staff at Hotel Scarlett are eager to please and very helpful; we stayed in the building without the elevator but the staff brought our bags both up and down. The Belleville area is great for people watching and food; we felt very safe at all hours there; lots of people out on their own late well into the evening; it is always a party on Rue de Belleville at night! Also has bakeries and bookshops. Fantastic blend of old and young locals and newcomers, well-to-do and semi-struggling. Hip eateries and wine bars mix nicely with old established places. Edith Piaf was born around the corner at 72 rue de Belleville; the only bad thing I would say about Belleville is the condition of the front of that building which is a disgrace to both the late, great Piaf and also Paris. The only vineyard in Paris (didn't know that Paris had a vineyard, did you; I didn't either!) is in Parc de Belleville which has an entrance on the next side street going up the hill (vineyard is past the lookout at the top of the park - great view of the skyline of Paris from the lookout). If you want to stay away from the tourists and get a feel for how the residents live, eat and play, come to Belleville and stay at the comfy-cosy Hotel Scarlett!\n",

      "  review_body : We loved our stay at Hotel Scarlett. The staff was absolutely exceptional. They were so willing to help us and accommodate us in any way. They made recommendations for restaurants and called about reservations. They printed items for us, brought us wine to the room and made sure our room was cleaned at a time that fit our schedule. The room is small but very well decorated and immaculate. The bed is very comfortable with nice linens. The shower is a good size with plenty of hot water and good water pressure. The lobby is awesome and a great place to hang out. There is a very good optional breakfast in the mornings. The rooms have air conditioning and there is a lift. We loved how they are environmentally conscious. You can leave one of your cards in a slot inside the door and the electricity is turned off while you are away. You pull it out as you enter the room and voila the power is on. Although the main road up to the hotel isn't anything memorable, don't be fooled by this. Just venture down the side roads and you will be pleasantly surprised by the quaintness and the wonderful cafes, restaurants and artists. Everything you could possibly need is 2 minutes away...wine bar, grocery store, butcher shop, bakery and the metro. It is a quick trip to almost anywhere in Paris. This is a great place to stay at a great price. I would 100% recommend it and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.\n",

Chose the hotel due to the excellent reviews (thanks) plus it was in an area in Paris I wasn't familiar with. More on the area in a bit.The hotel was really good. Modern and well appointed, clean and comfortable. The rooms are not large, it is Paris, but \"cosy\" and a surprisingly spacious shower! The staff were friendly and helpful and clearly enjoyed their role. Had breakfast one morning, plenty of options. We did stay on a weekend and the street/area was certainly boisterous on Saturday night, the double glazing had to work hard to keep things quiet. The area is certainly interesting, gritty with a heavy Chinese influence. But walk down to the Belleville Boulevard, turn left and it becomes very local very quickly. Metro is handy to the hotel.

The lift only seems to serve part of the hotel, as far as I could work out, so it may be worth checking on that if you will have difficulty with stairs. I didn't sample breakfast. It's a boutique hotel with a bit of character, which I prefer to the large chains. Wifi was slow although other reviews don't seem to say the same so perhaps it was my computer or I was unlucky with the room. There are two lovely parks quite nearby. It's not an affluent part of the city but I didn't have any concerns about safety although I saw some drug dealing.\n",

Everything from advice about where to eat, to how to navigate the metro, calling cabs for us, etc. We also came back one night with wine, cheese, baguettes, etc. and they helped us gather a bunch of glasses, utensils so that we could enjoy food on our balcony! Seriously, stay here! The rooms are small, completely to be expected, but assuming you aren't going to Paris to hang out in your room! Also, book one of the balcony rooms - the balconies are tiny, but perfect! Lastly - you are two blocks away from a the 2018 best croissant winner, with a MoF cheese store next door (means an amazing cheese!) complete with a wine shop and charcuterie all next door to each other- definitely visit!\n",

Very lovely to sit there in the evening and watch the Eiffel's light show at 10 pm. Pefect room which was sad to leave behind. Air conditioning would have been great though, because the weather was very hot. And there were a few tiny ants walking on the bathroom floor. They didn't bother me much and I threw them into toilet whenever I discovered one.The staff was just great, everyone friendly and we had some nice conversations.

      "  review_body : My husband and I stayed here about 6 years ago and were eager to enjoy this hotel again. We liked it’s quiet location on the left bank, about a block from Boulevard Saint-Germain and a short walk to the Seine. There is a tiny elevator which we really appreciated at the end of a long day and when checking in and out. The lobby and breakfast areas are somewhat elegant yet inviting. Our room had two large windows that brought in a lot of light and air. As well, the lighting in the room and bathroom were exceptional. It may be the first hotel where I didn’t wish I’d brought a light bulb. The closest was very large with built-in shelves and a safe. Bed, pillows and bedding were very good. Plenty of convenient outlets. There is no AC but there was a ceiling fan and a vertical floor fan. Room also had a desk, two chairs, a built in shelf for your suitcase and several hooks on the wall near the door— a nice amenity for jackets and hats. Bathroom was spacious with a good tub/shower with quick and plentiful hot water. There were enough towels and towel bars and a built in shelf to store your toiletries. The only thing I would change in the room would be the carpeting. We had breakfast three times—price was extremely reasonable and the dining area felt like we were in a fine restaurant. The hostess was very pleasant and brought a pot of coffee and hot milk to our table. Three types of cold meats, two or three kinds of cheese, jams, baguettes, croissants, chocolate croissants, cereal, yogurt, cut up fresh fruit and whole fresh fruit were available. Three mornings we only wanted coffee and my husband went down and picked up a tray of coffee and hot milk. The front desk is staffed 24 hours per day, and without exception the staff were friendly and helpful. I frequently saw them helping other guests and they kindly made taxi reservations for us. Definitely the hotel for us when we next visit Paris!\n",

There was more than adequate space and little touches, such as hooks on the walls and cubicles in the closet, made it very comfortable. Our room actually wrapped around the elevator, a worrying prospect at first, but we never heard it. Before our arrival I requested and got excellent instructions on how to get there on foot from the RER station. We had occasion to seek advice from several staff members and all were very helpful, friendly, and spoke good English. Breakfast was nothing special. We would return without hesitation.\n",

We would wake up in the morning and open the doors to have sunlight flood our room. There were balconies off of our room and the bathroom. The tub/shower was one of the best we've had in Europe - plenty of space. The bathroom itself was much roomier than we had anticipated.

      "  review_body : This boutique hotel in the Latin Quarter has easy access to a lot of cafes, a market, the metro and Notre Dame. So many cafes in that area that we never did try their €10 continental breakfast. Our room #523 was teeny tiny with just enough space to walk around the queen bed. The bathroom was also very small with a funny configuration and awkward with a step up into the shower. My husband (6’3”) and I (5’4”) could barely squeeze into the shower. Our daughter’s room #23 was slightly larger with a better toilet/sink configuration and tub/shower. In hindsight we should have switched rooms since we booked six nights. Paris was experiencing a heat wave the week we there and this hotel does not have air conditioning. The rooms are equipped with a ceiling and oscillating floor fan but it was so hot we had to open the windows and doors to get cool night air. Since both rooms faced the street, barking dogs, cars, trucks, motor cycles, and people partying made sleeping difficult. The double pane windows would have kept street noises to a minimum but without air conditioning, our room became a sauna as soon as we closed them. Our rooms were clean, the bed was comfortable and the staff are very helpful. Our daughter was scheduled to fly from Paris to Amsterdam the next day but at 14:00 hours Sunday afternoon she was notified that her flight on Monday was cancelled. As a result she had to depart immediately and the hotel did not charge her for the last night for which she was very grateful. \n",

We had to take a 12 minute walk to get to the nearest station which wasn’t all that bad. The daytime staff was very friendly and knowledgeable however the Conceirge that we had at night during our first two nights was horrible (August 19 and 20). My Advice - don’t ask him for anything. He misguided us on three different things 1) he told us that the only way to get to the Louvre was cia Taxi when in fact, we figured it out on our own via train2) he told me that the fitness center was closed permanently due to unforeseen circumstances and didn’t tell me where it was. One of the main reasons we booked here was because they had a fitness center. I feel a bit ripped off given the fact that I was not able to work out during my stay when in fact the website stated that the fitness center was open and available 3) every night when I went to pick up my room key from him, he was always surfing the net in a separate room in search for a new car and was completely inattentive and came across rude  Lastly, the breakfast was sub-par and service quality wasn’t the greatest. The staff couldn’t keep up with demand and most food stations were empty for long periods of time before getting refilledIn short - the location is great but the service and overall experience is sub-par\n",

The rooms are small as you would expect in Paris. The air conditioning and running hot water worked very well. The breakfast was also quite good and I'd recommend getting it. The staff during the day are very helpful and polite. The location is really good and there are good food options in the area if you look. The things that didn't click. First - if you need anything make sure you get it while the day folk are on duty. We wanted an extra blanket and then the next day a plate and the night receptionist is unable to help at all. Even though we could see plates in the dining room he wouldn't give us one. The other issue we had was when leaving. As we were about to call an Uber the receptionist told us there was a taxi outside that we could use. We asked if it was meters and were told it was. But once we got in we realised it wasn't metered and it was a private car. And we were about to be driven off without even any discussion on a fare. Sensing this wasn't above board we got out and got a proper cab.Outside of that the hotel is fine. You get good value for your money.\n",

They have a hotel cat that sleeps in the lobby, which is cute.We were greeted well upon arrival and the duration of our trip. The breakfast buffet has a nice selection and well presented, although I thought they were a bit slow to restock food and reset tables.The rooms are very small. Basically you have a foot between bed and walls, so when more than one person in room, you are very tight.The bathrooms are a foot away from the beds and are very small as well. For this reason, I give the hotel less rating. I like the option of having two adjoining rooms for the family, but I would rather spend more money and have bigger rooms. The shower did not have shelves, so your toiletries had to float in the water that did not drain well. The rug was also very stained. And the rooms facing the street, very noisy. But this is Paris, so understand the noise.The location is central. Lots of action, restaurants, food and drink nearby.\n",

      "  review_body : We spent a week at the Hotel Eiffel Seine in June. I’m so glad we chose this hotel. It’s full of charm with its artwork, colorful lobby, small elevator and narrow staircase. It’s just the kind of place we were hoping for. The morning we arrived Ella (I think that was her name) was working in the busy lobby. She was efficient and very friendly in spite of dealing with several parties. She gladly stored our luggage so we could go out until our room was ready. The room was great! It was clean and comfortable. We had plenty of space and it was very quiet - we overlooked the courtyard. I loved the high windows. Breakfast was very good. There were many different food choices. My husband tried using his very basic French with Farida, the woman who keeps the tables set and the food tables filled. We enjoyed our conversations with her every morning even though there was probably more English than French spoken! It was a pleasure to see her every morning. The location of this hotel couldn’t be better. The metro is across the street, there are restaurants right outside the door & a grocery store down the block. You can walk to the corner and see the Eiffel Tower - it’s only a few minutes walk to get there.I would happily stay there again and recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : Hotel Eiffel Seine is a Fantastic place to stay! It is centrally located and the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very professional and ALWAYS there willing to assist with your every need. The breakfast buffet was GREAT and had a variety of items to choose from including: bagels, bread for toast, eggs, bacon, juices, coffee, hot teas, different cheeses and french pastries, jams, cereal, yogurt and the list continues. The hotel is only a 15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and River Seine Cruise station. Also a short stroll to reach the Statue of Liberty in Paris. MANY places to dine and delight your palate are nearby. Grocery market is a 5 minute walk from the front door and one of the Paris subway stations is right across the street and very convenient to get around. This was my second stay at Hotel Eiffel Seine and I enjoyed it even more this time since I knew my way around a little better. Sophie was TERRIFIC and everyone on the hotel staff was so kind, pleasant and helpful.\n",

We thought we would possibly be staying in a dive, but could not have been more wrong. The rooms were simple and small, but were still clean and comfortable. The hotel had a very small elevator, so beware if you are traveling with a large group or large luggage, but the breakfast in the mornings was top notch. It is also located right across the street from a metro stop and a regional train station, so that made our quick trips to Montmarte, the Louvre, and the Champs Elysee (along with our day trip to Versailles) exceptionally easy and convenient. Well worth the money.\n",

One major flaw in hotel is its location in an area were cafes are not very good. Nearest decent cafes and restaurants were four blocks away.

There are also excellent walking paths in both directions along the Seine. It is a small hotel...both in the number of rooms and square footage - not at all uncommon on Paris and really not a problem for us. The breakfast was fantastic and the WiFi worked well. Beds were comfy and everything was spotless.The only reason I took it down a point was that our room was directly across from the subway (which runs above ground at this point). The road is quite busy with traffic and sirens late into the night. Still a wonderful place with caring staff and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. \n",

We were assigned the same room for both stays, a double club room with a view to the street and the subway station.We chose the hotel based on proximity to the Eiffel Tower (5 minute walk), the subway and the river cruise port. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance.The room was a good size and the bed comfortable, though it is a very low bed which might be an issue for some. For the most part the room was quiet, despite the busy road outside. We heard sirens occasionally. We heard more noise from inconsiderate guests in the hallway, at late hours.The room was a bit dated, many stains on the carpet. The bathroom could use some TLC as well, chipped tiles etc. The front desk staff and those in the breakfast room were friendly. We booked on their website and so breakfast was included in our rate. We only selected cold items - juice, yogurt, cereals, fruit and croissants, they were fine.\n",

The Eiffel Tower is just five minutes from the hotel. The room that we had was generously sized with a large bathroom. The bath was large and there was a good flow of water. All of the staff were friendly and made us feel at home - and even the hotel cat took time to check us over when we arrived. The continental breakfast, which was free if you booked online, was tasty, and the staffing running the morning service were polite and helpful.My only, and minor, criticism of the room was that some parts of the bathroom looked a little tired (cracked floor tiles, scratches on the bath and missing grouting). If this dealt with, it would give a much better impression.This is a great location for a trip to Paris.\n",

The rooms are small, but had plenty of closet space for storage. The rooms were clean and the beds were super comfortable. There’s also a stocked mini fridge in the room (for a fee), but there was space to add a couple bottles of our own water. We also enjoyed the buffet breakfast—eggs, bacon, croissants—free if booked on website. The hotel is very convenient to the sights of Paris—located across the street from the Bir Hakeim Metro station and a five minute walk from the Tour Eiffel and the Batobus which takes you up and down the Seine to all the sights. If you are a light sleeper, be sure to ask for a room on the inner side of the hotel (with a family room, we had one inner, one outer). There is a lot of street noise in the outer room from 7am-midnight. Fortunately, the hotel has AC, so no need to open the windows which help cut down the noise. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Eiffel Seine and would recommend.\n",

We were very amazed at how easy it was to travel from the airport to the hotel. Matter of fact the hotel is conveniently located directly across the street from the train station. Making it an easy commute to all sightseeing or points of interest. We arrived early but they were willing to store our luggage whilst we went too look around and find something to eat. Upon our return our room was ready and when we walked into the room the staff had laid rose petals, chocolates and birthday balloons on the nicely made up bed. I really felt special. We had a room with a Terrace, overlooking the train station and the Seine River. We were not bothered by outside noises. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They helped us make reservations for dinner, got us a taxi and told us what to do for our return. We enjoyed the free breakfast. Most of all the hotel is in close proximity to the Eiffel Tower. P.S I forgot my souvenirs at the front desk on checking out and they were very willing to mailing them back to the US to me.\n",

They gave us restaurant recommendations, they took in a package for us, and made me an ice pack when I fell at Versailles and hurt my elbow. We asked for a room with a nice view, and they delivered. There's no view of the Eiffel Tower, but we looked out on the city and the Seine. We even had a small balcony! We booked a regular room, through Expedia, but I feel like we got an upgrade. Rooms are small, and our bed was very close to the ground, but there is a fridge and a safe. There was a towel warmer in the good sized bathroom, but it didn't work.

Nice bathroom & shower (room 503). Stayed there 4 nights. Rooms are quiet from noise from other rooms or outside traffic. Restaurants: Subway sandwich shop right outside the front door on one side, pizza restaurant on the other side. Probably 20 or so restaurants within 3 blocks. Pricing gets better as you move along Grenelle Boulevard away from the Seine river - 8 euro for coffe at the restaurant adjacent to the hotel, 3-4 euro 2 blocks away. Staff is exceptional, especially George. We asked about a good local restaurant and he recommended Le Coup Chou and he even offered to call us a taxi and make a reservation. Amazing food and quality at this restaurant. George also patiently answered the dozens of questions we asked about the city and its sights & amenities over our 4 days there. What a gentleman! Breakfast at the hotel was very good. Small portions but you can take as much as you like. Meant to be a continental breakfast rather than a full on meal. Quality of the food was very good. Mini bar is very expensive. Go to the grocery store 2 blocks away if you want sodas or snacks for the room. It’s a 2 minute walk. We will definitely stay there again when we return to Paris due to the hotel’s location, quality & pricing for the room and the exceptional service we received.\n",

After we left this 3-star hotel, we went to a 5-star hotel near the Arc de Triomphe at which the room size was almost identical to the size of our Hotel Eiffel Seine room. Regarding breakfast, we conclude that we prefer the English breakfast to the French breakfast; but we tried breakfasts at some restaurants near our hotel and we ended up coming back to the hotel for most of our breakfasts.\n",

      "  review_body : This little hotel is around the corner from the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Bir Hakeim metro stop and the Champs de Mars train station. From these two stations, you can go anywhere! There are 2 great cafes right by it and a pharmacy close by. The rooms are small, but very clean, have a safe in the closet, hairdryer in the bathroom, and great AC and many TV channels. The front desk is 24 hours, so it is very convenient. The breakfast is a bit pricey, but you can just go to a cafe next door. They even have a resident cat that lives in the lobby. The kids loved it. We would definitely stay here again!\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at this hotel for from Oct 2-5. We were in a room overlooking the loud street and were a bit worried we wouldn’t get any sleep. However, once the windows were closed, it’s amazing how much sound was blocked!This hotel is small and quaint and in a fabulous location. Everything you could want is within walking distance, including both the Metro and RER train stations which are right across the street! Although the rooms are small (as are most in France as we discovered over our 16-day tour!), they are comfortable and clean. The hallways are extremely narrow and the elevator is teensy so we were nervous about our room, but we were pleasantly surprised! The bathroom is modern and the shower was wonderful! Breakfast is Continental style but the buffet includes delicious scrambled eggs, yogurt and mixed fruit. The ladies that work in the dining room go out of their way to be friendly! The reception desk is also opened 24 hours and all of the attendants are very nice and accommodating. A special mention to Elise who was exceptionally pleasant and helpful! \n",

      "  review_body : Loved the hotel. It was small, about 50 rooms and very personal service. Rudy, the evening desk clerk was unbelievably helpful in planning which restaurants, what cafes etc, how best to travel to sites etc. He was so personable and sweet. My parents are elderly and my father had fallen the day before in London and spent a day in the ER. When we arrived the next day in Paris, he was still healing and I was pretty emotionally spent and he couldn’t have been kinder. Even made me a cup of tea from his own private stock. The other two women, whose names I probably will misspell, Elyse and Nilo, were also so kind and helpful. Elyse even called the tourism office for me and asked a question in French since no one was answering the English line. So very happy we chose this hotel for our 1st visit to Paris. Definitely would stay here again. \n",

Close to convenience store to get supplies and plenty of restaurants just outside hotel. Front desk staff are very welcoming. The only negative comment I have would be the breakfast. Although the lady looking after the breakfast was very friendly there was no urgency about her to restock the breakfast. When we came down two of the mornings at around 8am there was nothing left, and she didn’t seem to be in a hurry to replace. Once we got food it was ok.\n",

      "  review_body : People who complain about their rooms being small must not travel to Europe very often, it's common place...big isn't always better like they say in America. You're here to enjoy the sights, not hang around in your room.Our room (504) was very comfortable, clean and QUIET even though we were on the street side. I think the hotel put heavier glass in the windows (tall, almost door size windows) because I had read earlier reviews complaining of noise. Not so, at least not in our room. once we closed the windows all but the very loudest noise was blocked, and even they were muffled. We got a very good nights rest all six nights.While the entire staff was very helpful and friendly, I need to give a big shout out to RUDY, what a character he is! Funny, helpful, speaks excellent english and is a credit to the Hotel Eiffel Seine. He works the night shift, and took the time to help me pronounce French words (good one Rudy!).The elevator for this hotel is he smallest I have ever been in, barely room for two people with light luggage, but this is not a bad thing in my eyes, it adds character to the hotel. If you're claustrophobic, close your eyes for a few seconds...it doesn't take long to get you to your floor.I heard complaints from others about having to give your key to the receptionist before you left and pick it back up upon your return. I don't see what the problem is, one less thing to worry about losing and the receptionists always gave priority to incoming and outgoing guests, so you never had to wait for your key, coming or going.Breakfast here was enjoyable, nothing fancy, but what they did offer was very tasty. My wife and I don't want a big meal before we go out to do a lot of walking and sightseeing. My one and only complaint about our entire stay though, would be that we were under the impression Breakfast was free, apparently it is not, you will be billed for it at the end of your stay and it was pretty pricey.Speaking of sightseeing, the Hotel Eiffel Seine is in a fantastic location, just a 10 minute (or less) walk to the Eiffel tower and access to both the RER and Metro system is directly across the street. All in all we enjoyed our stay here immensely, and we would highly recommend it to others. One tip I would give you though is to stay away from the restaurants adjacent to the hotel (with the exception of the Subway Restaurant), they are complete rip-off's, food is terrible and extremely pricey...basically speaking, avoid all the yellow canopied restaurants next to or close to the hotel (3 in total I think) as they are all in cahoots with each other and prey on tourists.\n",

The photos on the website didn't have any resemblance to the room we were assigned. I will say that the beds and the linen were clean and I was worried as another traveller claimed to have bed bugs from this hotel. I can say that we DID NOT have any issues in this way at all.The bathroom was adequate but leaked and I have addressed this with the hotel staff. They assured me that they will get maintenance to look at it.Overall the staff were pleasant and nice. We (the hotel and I) addressed my disappointment in the size of the room and the bathroom leaking and I was happy with the outcome. The area is very different from our previous accom in Paris but at no time did I feel unsafe. If you want a bigger room then you have to pay more. For the price we paid I expected a little more. And I want to say I get European small rooms.It was really a 3 star hotel. \n",

I made the reservation from their website which offered free breakfast. And now while I’m currently staying in the Hotel, I find that the free breakfast was just a hoodoo to attract. They provide what they have and dont make anything to order. Its the worst breakfast offering I have ever seen while on my trips. If the hotel management can take a good note, I would suggest them to provide atleast eggs/omelets, fresh fruits which is a bare minimum that every hotel provides. On top of that, there was no cleaning of the breakfast room/table. It was only when I told I have no place to sit, the staff cleaned up the table.\n",

Yes, small, but like I said, we expected this. Our first day, we wanted to see Eiffel Tower, and it is very close. We wanted to see it at night, and all we had to do was run across the street where we could see it from the bridge over the Seine. Cafes very close. The breakfast at the hotel was very good with much variety and plenty. We stayed two nights on some of the hottest days of the summer. The air conditioning in our room was just \"okay,\" but sufficient. Would recommend to others based on our visit. (loved your lobby guard cat :))\n",

My bf and I Notified male receptionist later that evening if he could possible change the sheets or switch rooms, and he said he can’t do anything about it, and that the cleaners are gone for the night. Upset that my bf and I had to grin and bear it the whole night until the next morning we complained to the female receptionist who agreed to switch rooms on the very last night.

The hotel staff was extremely friendly and bilingual. The desk was staffed 24 hours and we were blocks from the tower. Our breakfast was a delicious buffet of cheeses, meats, cereals, pastries, breads and eggs. Yogurt and fresh fruit was also available. We were able to store our luggage while we took the underground to Notre Dame Cathedral. The hotel was surrounded by many cafes and the river Seine. We sat at a boat turned lounge and enjoyed wine while waiting for dark so we could see the tower lit. I would absolutely recommend this hotel!\n",

      "  review_body : This is the Hotel you were looking for. Right in the middle of Montmartre, you will feel like a local. This is a great hotel in a little street just a few steps away from all the bistros and boutiques. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by qualified multilingual staff. I happened to meet the adjoint director Mauricio Castillo, a wonderful guy from Chile who welcomed us like a cousin welcomes family on Christmas Day. Check-in was fast and simple. The room we got was splendid, spotless, colorful, perfect. All the amenities and services you could imagine and more. A huge TV, safe deposit, tub, comfy pillows, and duvets. The building is like an ancient manor. The breakfast area is located in the basement which resembles a wine cellar. We met the wonderful woman in charge of breakfast, Maria Lopes, from Portugal. She talked to us and made us feel so welcomed. She got really happy knowing we would visit Portugal a few days later. The food was splendid. A lot of options to choose from and the best part, the coffee. If you are traveling with your loved ones, you will certainly enjoy this hotel, just 3 minutes walk you will find the metro station Blanche, right in front of the Moulin Rouge. All in all, the are is very safe, you never have to look over your shoulder. There's plenty in the neighboorhood to choose from. Bars, restaurants, bistros, and more. Wi-fi is strong and extremely fast, in case you travel with teenagers or need to catch on some work, and they will securely store your luggage after check-out in case you need to catch a train later that day. This hotel will welcome you with open arms. The staff is top professional. We are definitely coming back.\n",

      "  review_body : Le Relais is a charming boutique hotel situated on a quiet side street in the midst of bustling Montmartre. Our beamed-ceiling room was on the fifth floor and had a view across a central courtyard. At about 190 square feet plus bathroom it was not spacious but was well equipped and included a mini bar, safe, ironing board and attractive period furnishings. The bathroom had an in-tub shower and a heated towel rail. The bedside reading lights were very good. The air conditioning was not very effective but sleeping with the windows open did the trick and there was no outside noise.There was neither pen nor notepaper and the in-room supply of coffee and tea was very small. Moreover, even these limited supplies were not replenished so, by the second day, we had no pen, paper, coffee or sugar.Upon our arrival we had a warm and informative reception and all the staff were pleasant. They happily printed boarding passes and arranged for taxis.The cellar has a delightful breakfast room with a good buffet plus hot dishes cooked to order.There is an elevator.\n",

      "  review_body : I’m writing this as I wait for my taxi in the lovely reception area overlooking the terrace! We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this small but perfectly formed French hotel. Our room was on ground level with very little house and the most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept in- it was difficult to get out of it to see the sights of Paris and Montmartre. Outside of the Centre of Paris, Montmartre is beautiful with so many cobbled streets lined with cafes, restaurants, chocolatiers and shops- all right at the end of the street! Our room was beautifully decorated, and so nice and bright complete with French shutters, toiletries, tea/coffee facilities and a reasonably priced mini bar if you want it! The hotel does offer breakfast which didn’t opt to take, and doesn’t have a restaurant or bar but there are so many to choose from it’s not a big deal. All receptionists were so polite and helpful and recommended a delicious steak restaurant around the corner Les Fines Lames which serves chorizo sauce to die for! Paris Centre isn’t too far away at a €12-15 Uber taxi away which saves metro confusion which we couldn’t be bothered with but is at the bottom of the street if you do! Moulin rouge is also at the bottom of the street and Disney is a 50 min transfer away!A perfect base for you to explore beautiful Paris. \n",

There is a list of free extras and you just have to ask. Room service is basically asking them to phone for a takeaway which is fine and all we needed when we arrived late and tired. For a short stay this hotel is perfect, particularly in the winter. It's between two metros and the area above it, towards Sacre Coeur, is wonderful - full of little specialist food shops, supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and boutiques. Breakfast is pricey but worth it. It has a huge selection however my son only wanted all the chocolate croissants and nutella and the hot chocolate is great. But there are cafes close by which serve breakfast at half the price and a quarter the amount. Finally, this is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in.\n",

      "  review_body : Le Relais is a gorgeous boutique hotel tucked just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Montmartre to make it perfect. Great places to eat, drink and shop are only steps away and the walk to Sacre Coeur and Place du Tetre is quite manageable. Our room was generous, particularly for Paris, and beautifully styled with all the little things necessary to ensure a comfortable stay... tea/coffee facilities, A/C, in-room safe and a lovely bathroom. The staff were friendly and helpful and we would stay here in again gladly.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here for 2 nights during a short stay in Paris. The location is great in a quiet side street with lots of local shops (cafes, restaurants, wine, bread, chocolate, small supermarkets and lots more) nearby. You can walk from here to the Blanche metro station in 3 or 4 minutes. You can also easily walk up to Sacré Cœur although this will take a bit longer. Our ground floor hotel room was comfortable in every respect and larger than expected for Paris where hotel rooms tend to be small. The bedroom and en-suite bathroom were spotlessly clean with lovely Rituals toiletries provided. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and there was a safe, a kettle with tea and coffee and even usb sockets to charge our phones and iPads. Free WiFi too. The staff were friendly and helpful and reception is manned 24/7. We would 100% go back here next time we visit Paris as this hotel would be hard to beat for the price we paid.\n",

      "  review_body : Paris in November is a great time to be there. It's still warm enough to walk around, but a lot of the crowds have gone and you feel like you're actually in France. Montmartre is special. It has a villagy feel, with independent restaurants, bars and businesses and of course has a great history. This hotel is lovely. It is very conveniently situated for transport links, has every amenity on its doorstep and the rooms are beautiful and tasteful. Plus it was remarkably good value for Paris. With the brilliant metro links you can get to all the major tourist destinations within half an hour and then retire back to this wonderful area for a night in a restaurant or bar.\n",

This time we were helped to avoid the worst problems of the transport strike.Breakfast is a relatively simple continental one, but everything is good quality, fresh and frequently replenished.I can't imagine one could do better for a reasonable price: we certainly are happy to return - before too long, I hope!\n",

The staff was less than friendly. One woman at the desk was sometimes rude. I understand this attitude can be normal in France, but shouldn’t be at a hotel that serves tourists. In all, I would’ve given it an average rating, except for the room. Our room was at street level right behind the front desk. It was incredibly noisy and very hot. We had no way to turn down the heat, as the thermostat did not work. The street noise was quite loud. To deal with the heat, we had to open our window, which made the street noise even louder. This also made us worry about someone breaking in, because we were right off the sidewalk with partiers passing all night. On top of that, Front Desk employees would watch TV late into the night which we could hear in our room. I’ve had much worse experiences, but it was a below average stay for me.\n",

Not large but very comfortable with plenty of closet space and nice bathroom. Good A/C. We had a small balcony from which we could see the L'Arc de Triomphe. That put us on the street side but it was quiet at night. Good breakfast. Excellent staff. Very helpful with dinner reservations, taxi, etc. And they truly are open 24 hrs as we found out when we came back very late one night. The location is excellent-- plenty of restaurants and stores nearby. In a quiet neighborhood away from the crowds of Ile de la Cite but only a block from the metro which will take you anywhere quickly and cheaply. Even on a day when the metro was on strike we used Uber with no problems. The price is still an excellent value despite their recent renovation. Thumbs up all around.\n",

Great Metro station and the Charles de Gaulle bus hub less than two blocks away, and just a few blocks to the Champs-Elysees. The staff was uniformly friendly and efficient. This was the first of five hotels we stayed with during a two week vacation in France and Spain, and this was the best breakfast we encountered. Yes, some of the others offered hot items, usually eggs and sausages or the like, cooked some time ago and kept warm in a hotel pan over a Sterno flame. I'll pass on that food safety dice-roll any time in favor of good, fresh fruits and breads, with an attentive, friendly staff keeping items stocked and tables cleared and cleaned. And don't even start comparing it to American \"breakfast\" offerings, which are almost universally garbage.\n",

When we arrive to our room, the room had a ciggarette smell (smoke). We had to leave the room and go down the lobby to tell her the situation, after we came back (in the night) the smell dissapeared. The room that we bought was large for what Paris offer (Jr Suite if i recall), and the AC in the room was perfect, we didn't hear any noise at all from our room.But the problem in this hotel is the breakfast, trust me it is horrible. We had to eat cereal with milk the two days because it was the \"safe choice\". I would expect AT LEAST some eggs for a 3 star hotel, but no, there was no hot breakfast at all, it was just cold breakfast. So be ready to eat only different types of bread, hams, yogurt and some cheese. So please if you stay for location and price, go and eat somewhere else.\n",

It was perfect for our excursions.Our room was on the first floor (2nd floor in the US) and we had a view of the Arc de Triomphe. The afternoon sun shining on the west wall of the Arc was beautiful. Our room was spotless and appointed with coffee (albeit instant with a kettle), extra pillows and full amenities including slippers. For Paris, the room was large and the bathroom was modern with a deep bathtub and shower combo. It felt luxurious and again spotless. We spent 4 nights in the hotel and had no complaints whatsoever.Breakfast was a variety of baked goods, meats, cheeses, cereal, yogurt and fruit. The coffee maker brewed various coffees including espresso, lattes and cappuccinos. Delicious. The dining room was serviced each time a guest finished eating. There is a bar and comfortable lounge area to relax anytime of day. The desk is staffed 24 hours. We loved our stay and this hotel has become our new spot to stay when visiting Paris.\n",

This boutique hotel was charming and old world French. The room and bathroom were new and immaculate. We had a beautiful view from our balcony of the Arc.Breakfast was plentiful and had a typical Europeanselection. All services were excellent with Lucy being particularly helpful planning each day’s excursion.The price was fair for such a great location.Samir was helpful with our plans as I emailed with him before our trip.A special note about a ”find” during our stay. Around the corner on Avenue Carnot is a small restaurant L’Arc Food. It has a few tables and a LARGE menu of sandwiches, burgers, salads, pizza, crepes... and much more. Food is excellent and there is a young staff who opened this restaurant 2 years ago. Try it - you’ll love it!\n",

And in AMERICA, if you stay at a hotel and put the Do Not Disturb sign up, that usually is a hint to housekeeping that we don't want you coming into our room. So I left some of my items out thinking they would be safe. WRONG!!! I had wrapped my retainers up and put them NEXT TO my contact lens case. When I came home from a long day out, I came to find the room had been cleaned and my retainers TOSSED! I confronted management about it and all they did was send me to a DEAD END of a company who takes care of their liability insurance. This BS company said that they would not consider MY LOSS as ANY LIABILITY AT ALL. It's not my fault some dumb employee didn't KNOW ANY BETTER and thought my retainers were TRASH! They were next to something that wasn't TRASH and YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WORST PLACE EVER. WORST SERVICE EVER. They are ABSOLUTELY REFUSING to pay ANY AMOUNT OR OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKE. They were NOT supposed to COME IN IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN THE SIGN SAID DO NOT DISTURB.

When we asked the front desk person how we could get to the airport for our flight she said she didn't know. She offered no assistance with our situation. I have never had someone in the hospitality be so dismissive. Hours later we emailed the hotel and someone arranged a car hire that we would meet several blocks away. When we returned from dinner we asked the front desk where do we meet this car and what the name of the service was. He said ask in the morning. We were in disbelief that he won't answer such a simple question. In addition to the rude employees the walls were paper thin. We could clearly hear every word of the phone conservation in the room next to us. An email that we sent to the hotel that addressed our problems and concerns to this day has not been answered.

The room was well appointed with large BATH room which my wife loved. Individual air conditioning, good sized rooms, excellent breakfast to start the day, all was great in the hotel. The staff were ALWAYS very helpful booking tables and taxis for us so we could not wish for more from a hotel. The staff also recommended the \"Le Hide\" restaurant just around the corner which was a great eatery on the doorstep. A five star hotel with three star prices: a gem in central Paris. We would definitely visit again...\n",

The hotel was so convenient for our weekend in the love capital of Europe. The room was smart enough and the breakfast was enticing and varied. Staff excellent and the shower worked!

The hotel was a perfect choice for watching the bike race. The Arch de Triumph was within eye sight from the hotel. I arrived early in the morning and fully expected to wait for my room to be ready. To my surprise, the room was ready and I checked in to catch up on sleep after an all night flight. My room was perfect for one person. Comfortable bed, nice flat screen TV, personal balcony, great free WiFi, modern bathroom with walk in shower. Now for the free daily breakfast. OMG, what a great perc! Pastries, cheeses, 4 types of meats, dry cereal, yogurt, juices and a wonderful coffee machine that makes every kind of coffee drink with the push of a button. Beautiful, spacious dining room so I never felt cramped. This was one of the best hotel finds yet! When I go back to Paris, I will stay there again. BTW, the staff was remarkable! So helpful, so informative and so eager to please their guests! There are not enough stars available to do justice to this great Paris hotel!\n",

This time we were a bit alarmed to see scaffolding outside: but as we always elect to stay at the back this had no impact on us. In fact we heard no disturbance from renovations anywhere in the hotel.Why do we keep coming back? Well, as most reviewers point out, the location couldn't be bettered. Close proximity to the 'Le Bus' (used to be 'Les Cars') stop for airport transfers; excellent restaurants nearby; spectacular views of the Arc de Triomphe and a floodlit Eiffel Tower - all real plus points.Then there is the hotel itself. We have always found it very quiet, despite the prime location, and always sleep well in its comfortable beds. Rooms are a good size, with fresh décor and immaculate housekeeping. Breakfast is a continental buffet, not elaborate, but everything is of good quality (bread, pastries and fresh fruit salad exceptional), pots of tea or coffee are brought to your table, and buffet items are regularly and quickly topped up so everything is very fresh.Finally, all staff are welcoming and efficient, and seem to take pleasure in ensuring that your stay is a happy one.We shall certainly be back!\n",

(I actually just booked our next stay, and panicked when Expedia said they were sold out for Bastille Day. Emailed the hotel and got lucky that there was availability for a family room!!)The room for this trip was a standard room with a double bed (no kids with us for this trip). The room was pretty basic, but was very clean and comfortable. Had a balcony with a view of the courtyard. The room was also a decent size for being in Paris.The breakfast was fresh and very tasty. Staff was very attentive, and brought coffee refills before we even ran out. Excellent service. The hotel staff was also incredibly friendly, and although I speak some French, they spoke English as well, which was helpful when I struggled. One of the best aspects of this hotel was the location!!! Right down the street from the Arc de Triomphe, literally, and close to the train, buses, taxis, etc. Also close enough to walk to the Eiffle Tower if you don't mind a 30 minute stroll with some awesome shops and cafes along the way.Last, but not least, the price for what you get can't be beat! I love this hotel so much, I was hesitant to review it because I don't want it to get too popular.. I might not be able to reserve a room next time!!

      "  review_body : My sister and I spent 4 nights here in May on her first-ever time in Paris (it was my first time back in 30 years). The rate was reasonable and the amenities, especially daily breakfast, were wonderful for the price. The front desk is staffed round-the-clock and nearly all the staff spoke English well enough that we had no problems communicating. The hotel is very close to the Arc du Triomphe, which I worried would mean we were in an overly touristy area. All it turns out to mean is that the hotel is very used to international tourists and is happy to serve them. The breakfast buffet included endless amounts of cafe au lait, cheese, ham, fruit, bread and croissants. The lobby was lovely and the room (especially compared to the \"double\" we had at a budget hotel in London) was spacious enough for two of us to feel comfortable, with a full modern bath (with a tub/shower you could actually turn around in without banging a body part into a fixture!). The location was ideal to hop on the Metro to go anywhere, and just a block or so from the Champs Elysees. We felt safe and comfortable and the staff was friendly and kind. The hotel is on a street with a beer bar on one side and a full-service restaurant immediately across. We also found a small convenience store to buy fruit, snacks and drinks just a few doors down. As newbies in Paris, we didn't spend much time in the room other than sleeping, so we didn't much care that the TV was terrible. Who goes to Paris to watch TV?\n",

The location of the hotel was fantastic. It made Paris doable even without benefit of the Metro or busses. I highly recommend using the airport shuttle that the hotel recommends. On time, hassle free, and competent. It was well worth the 18E per person. As others have stated the rooms are Paris small, but clean and well equipped. Daily maid service happened with no fuss and rooms were nicely made up. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom clean and plenty of hot water. It you are looking for a quiet isolated location, this isn’t it, there is some hubbub on the small streets surrounding the location -which frankly provided the Parisian atmosphere. A small convenience store is a block away with a larger M&S and Monoprix 3-4 blocks away. Lots of restaurants and a fantastic chocolate shop on your doorstop. \n",

      "  review_body : I don’t know what’s worse, the girl and guy at the front desk who have zero problem solving skills, or the horrible state/smell of the hotel that does not represent the photos online at all. The lobby shows that a classic room is €900 but yet they charge €100 per night if you refer to an online booking agencies listed price. False advertising? No business ethics? I think the icing on the cake (besides the broken TV, stench of sewage in the elevator and all floors, abysmal 80’s looking plastic shower stalls, and scuffed up floors) is the staff ganged up together to refused to help me, a very pregnant woman on my last two days in Paris who just got stuck in 2 hours of traffic due a protest. Now I bet the wretched women who have been commenting on other reviews will probably say the had nothing to do with the protest, but it’s not about that. It’s about showing one ounce of sympathy for your clients who have chosen to stay with you over the 100’s of other hotels. Have a little bit of respect for those who pick you. The blonde woman at the front refused to give me the owners contact details and told us that he has no time for our problems because he owns 9 other hotels in Paris. Way to throw your boss under the bus. Disgusting hotel and disgusting attitudes to follow. After this experience my husband and I walked around the neighborhood and found several accommodation options with extremely friendly and helpful staff who let you see the rooms before committing. I hope your owner sees this and spends some time training the crying staff on customer service skills, how to listen and problem solve and how to show empathy to people in need, such as extremely pregnant women.\n",

The location is in the best spot: less than 1 block from the Metro and RER (including the one that goes to the airport), steps from Notre Dame, St. Germain, Shakespeare and Co., Sainte Chapelle, and not to far from the Louvre. The hotel staff was extremely friendly the entire time. They were extremely patient with me as I very slowly practiced my French with them. The breakfast in the morning was quite extensive and better than what I would get at a cafe (bread, eggs, cheese, fruit yogurt, bacon, ham, crepes). The one thing that may bother some travelers is the bathroom is a \"European\" bathroom in that there are no shower doors so you get basically the whole floor wet. We were okay with this and planned our days to either at the beginning or end with showers. I've read some reviews about street noise, so I brought ear plugs but I didn't need them. I will also say that I live in a major US city with noise, so I may be used to it. I would absolutely stay here again!\n",

We ended up in the Louvre area, a great place to sightsee for the afternoon. From the Louvre, it was a 20 minute walk back to the Latin Quarter which was brimming with cafes, restaurants, clubs and more. On Sunday evening, we wanted to see a real Parisien cabaret, and the staff at the Hotel Saint Severin did not disappoint! They arranged dinner reservations at Paradis Latin, a local’s favorite, and I think we ended up with the best seats in the house. The dinner and show was fantastic!

The hotel staff was fantastic and we stored our luggage when we arrived in the morning until we could check-in at 2pm.

The only complaint about the hotel is the noise. Both being able to hear the neighboring rooms and the outside.

      "  review_body : Pleased with the excellent service and friendliness of the staff. They spoke english very well; I tried to speak to them in french, and they were very patient with me. Room was very clean. My only complaint is that the room was very small, as are most Parisian hotel rooms; I would have liked to have a suitcase stand, but there was no room for it. Also, the room is not very well soundproofed; I could clearly hear my neighbor talking on the phone at night. But again, the staff was SO friendly and helpful, and the location was great - right around the corner from the fountain at Place St Michel. Getting to the RER B train for an early-morning trip to the airport was a breeze - short 5-7 minute walk to an entrance that had an elevator; took me straight to the train platform for a direct train to CDG - no transferring, and it cost only 10.3 euros; lots less than a cab, and no worrying about getting stuck in Monday morning traffic.\n",

The overall experience was so good I decided to spend my whole 5 days in the same hotel.Decoration is quirky, room 605 being based on African recycl'art, such a nice change from the usual hotel standard. The room is totally soundproof although on a main street, something difficult to find in Paris, has a balcony and views of Sacré-Coeur. The location is so convenient, right in front of Gare du Nord.The breakfast was fabulous and another highlight of my stay. I also had dinner twice there and it was a very nice experience with lots of different type of cuisines to choose from.Each member of personnel was very nice, something of an oddity in Paris.After many tries over the years this is now my favourite Paris hotel.\n",

In November we negotiated £500 for 4 nights including breakfast and 2 free drinks from the carte at the bar.

Had room on fifth floor which faced into a square. Room although small was adequate, except for having to lean over the bed if wanted to get around it to avoid the television cabinet on the wall. Room very quiet and never heard another person or noise from another room. Shower good and hot. Bed comfortableBar nice, music a bit loud and cocktails expensive,staff great and friendly.Breakfast- various choices and good start for a day of sight seeing.Beware of beggers outside hotel who will approach you whenever you step out of the door,(in our case for a cigarette, so could be because we were standing still) but do leave you alone as soon as you say no.We did not use the metro, which again is right outside hotel doorway and travelled by taxi which we found to be good price.Bag storage available on checking out which is at midday and our train was not until 4pm so this was great. Suitcases are tagged like at an airport and you are given a number ticket for each bagWould recommend this hotel as great value,comfortable and good location for eurostar, especially if you do not want to be dragging suitcases around after travelling lol)\n",

From the doorman-bellhop-tourist information center all rolled into one up to the check-in staff, we were welcomed with warmth. Mahloud, the doorman (I don’t know if I spelled his name correctly) was the smiling face that helped welcome us. He was also ready to tell us where to go for what. Our room was located through the bar. It was rather small and with our bags, it became a challenge to just cross the room to the windows. We had a view of the train station and the quaint street; we loved this view.A train stop is located a few steps from the hotel door, so convenience was truly offered to visitors.

I called the hotel beforehand to ask if it would be possible to upgrade to a medium plus room so that we could have a balcony as opposed to medium room which comes without, it was agreed I could pay extra on the day to upgrade. When arriving not only was the room upgraded for our two night stay, but it was upgraded to a large plus bedroom free of charge! I have the hotel assistant MD to thank for this, but even without this upgrade, I must say it is people like MD and the attentiveness he showed to us throughout our stay that really make a difference to an already great trip, meaning the next time I return to Paris, I will be booking this hotel again. I asked MD for an iron, I received an iron and ironing board within 10 minutes to my door, I explained to MD my train didn’t leave until 6pm, and he allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel all day after checkout, in their secure luggage room, thank you! When booking this hotel as part of a Eurostar breakfast, I got breakfast included in the price, when I arrived and seen that breakfast would have cost €24 Per person, I thought this seemed slightly expensive and was glad I had already paid for it, however after enjoying two amazing buffet breakfasts which included help yourself champagne, lovely pastries, cheeses, meats, Cooked to order eggs and brioche french toast, I realised it was worth the price and is up there with the best hotel breakfasts I have had.

      "  review_body : arrived early evening and left early next morning so I didn't have long to enjoy the hotel. It is the perfect location directly across from Gare du Nord yet quiet inside. I was greeted well, all made easy and I felt very wonderful when I entered the room and was enveloped in the fantastic mix of african and asian decor. For me, the best for any weary traveller, is how incredibly comfortable it was to fall into the bed with divine pillows and linen. The bathroom is roomier than some others I've had in Paris and the toiletries are fabulous smelling and feel great, so much so that I wanted to wash my hair in it.The Neni restaurant is lovely to sit in and although I thought the menu a little more pricy than I expected, the food was full of flavour with fragrant spice and some chilli. The only issue I had was two minor mixups with my drink and the receiving another table's bill - both of these fixed quickly and with apologies and a smile.\n",

This is actually a large hotel and is very busy, but the friendly staff make it all look very boutique and laid back. Rooms are very comfortable and have some interesting conversation pieces dotted around.Best surprise was the restaurant. After a Eurostar dash to London for a business lunch I wasn't really keen on going out for dinner, so we \"settled\" for the hotel restaurant. Great surprise - the food, wine and service were all absolutely wonderful..Hotel is right next to Big Bus and another Hop-on / Hop-off, plus Metro and of course Gare de Norde and Est.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed at the Terminus hotel before Summer and I was so impressed. This time, I have been upgraded to a medium room on arrival which was really nice. I didn't get my usual welcome drink ticket but not a big deal. I had a pretty unpleasant experience at breakfast. Last time I went to the first floor for breakfast and I have been offered a choice between the full breakfast and a quick one at €9. This time, I thought I was going to do the same thing but someone arrived to tell me that I had to go to the ground floor for that option. It just felt a bit unpleasant with a tone which was not really friendly. I went next to reception to grab coffee, a croissant and an orange juice but the all experience was a bit strange. In any case, from day 2 I went to have breakfast next door at the Brasserie Terminus. When I came back to my room on the last evening, the room hasn't been cleaned or the bed done. All together, I still think that it is a great hotel but this time was not the best experience. Nobody asked me on checkout how my stay has been so didn't have the opportunity to share what I am telling you. \n",

      "  review_body : 25Hours Hotel Terminus Nord is located right opposite the Gare Nord train terminal....really convenient if you need to take the train.Located in an old building, the theme of this hotel appears to be “friends of the world”....with a very hippie feel to the entire deco. Fortunately, the large room, which we stayed in, was considerably big for the price and location....having stayed in other Parisian hotels, it was worth the price. Room facilities were clean although I was disappointed that they did not provide complimentary bottled water, bedroom slippers, bathroom robes, dental nor grooming kits.The pillows were too soft and flat though the comforter was plush and the mattress was comfortable.The bathroom was sizeable and clean.We especially appreciated the bath area with the powerful water jet from the hand shower. The hair dryer voltage provided a quick dry in the morning.As this hotel was built within an old building, the elevators were small and limited. Thus, it was a considerable wait for the elevator to arrive. Also, it was long, winding walk to our room from the lift foyer.One interesting point was that our friend’s room assigned (#243) did not exist and their own staff was puzzled when we went back to reception after failing to locate it. The fact was this room was actually #221.1(!!!) - which we were not told when they passed her the keys. It was frustrating walking to and fro, in the narrow walkways to look for a room number which does not exist!Then, why even have #243?!?!I am not sure if I will return to 25Hours as I do not feel safe in the area, especially at night. If this do not bother you, it is an interesting hotel to try. Something different from the mainstream hotel chains.\n",

One could spend a few hours just exploring this hotel. The rooms are small, but well organized which make them more adequate than hotels with larger rooms. The toilt and shower are separate and tstfully done. Bed is very comfortable. Lots of art throughout the hotel that create a visual adventure. The breakfast is excellent, although al ittle pricey. From the hotel you can get to anywhere in paris in about 15-20 minutes via the underground. You can also catch the Eurostar which is located right across the street from the hotel.

He even rang us immediately to check we were happy with the room. I’m already planning to use this hotel again when I next visit Paris.

But we had such a warm welcome from the colleague on reception who'd studied in London and chatted about our hometown of Brighton, we felt at home straight away. I'd booked a large room for our three day stay and we were given a lovely room, with doors out to a balcony and great views of the Gare du Nord. The room was comfortable and beautifully decorated with fun elements. It's worth doing a bit of research about the room sizes: the hotel is very clear about what you get in each category. My only slight grumble is about the bathroom - it looks wonderful and has a good shower but it's not very functional when there's nowhere near the wash basin to hang towels.Breakfast was good with lots of interesting choices and plenty of staff on hand if you need anything.

The staff were very helpful and have great local knowledge. The rooms we found very disappointing. It was like they were trying to do everything they could not to be a normal room. Some of the things in the room were interesting but far from functional. We had no where in our room to sit other than the bed. The shower was a stand alone bathtub in the same room as everything else that you pull a curtain around which might look trendy but it was extremely disappointing when used. It was probably one of the most interesting but total uncomfortable rooms we have ever stayed in. After returning from dinner and knowing there were no coffee facilities in our room we thought we would use the coffee facilities in the lobby area only to be told they were closed at a certain time. We just simply found that this hotel tries way to hard to be hip that it has gone to the point that it doesn’t function as a hotel should.

I stayed at this hotel one night and used it as a Paris base of operations and my only complaint was that I didn't get to explore it further. I had a one person room and while it wasn't \"cupboard under the stars at privet drive\" small, it was a typical European hotel room that made my morning routine of jumping jacks and laps around the bed a little challenging. One thing that really surprised me about the hotel was how good the WiFi was. At many hotels this is hit or miss but at Terminus, it was quite robust. I also thought the room was quite clean and although its location was right across from the train station (side note: use the Rue de Dunkerque exit from the metro) I had no issues sleeping or getting good rest at this location. The only problem I did have was looking like a rube trying to find the entrance to the hotel. If you'd rather blend in, the entrance is right on the corner of the intersection and has automatic doors. I didn't have a chance to eat at any of the restaurants but the food looked good and the staff were very friendly...even pretending that my french was passable which I suppose also speaks to their acting abilities. All in all, I'd highly recommend this hotel.\n",

Lots of kitschy ornaments in the room and we never did quite work out how the lights worked but it was a fun place to stay and super convenient for the Eurostar and easy transport links to the rest of Paris from Gare du Nord. We will certainly consider staying in another 25hrs hotel and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel as a interesting base for a few days in Paris.\n",

My wife wants to know where they get their mattresses from. So comfortable! The breakfast was buffet style everything you could want. Our big breakfast set us up for a day out and about in Paris. It is worth checking the hotels own website for prices and booking direct as we could have saved quite a bit had we done so. Great location too opposite the Gare de Lyon but still very quiet inside.\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is expensive and has to be judged accordingly. Maison Favart is in a great location and from the moment you walk through the door you receive a warm welcome from everyone. The concierge , Vincent, is everything you want a concierge to be. He listened carefully to the sorts of restaurants we liked and made great proposals. The room was very comfortable and the street is pretty quiet. The bathroom was large and cosseting. Unfortunately we returned late one afternoon to find the room had not been serviced. Another morning an empty shower gel had not been replaced. We disagree with the reviews that the breakfast buffet is good. Fruit juice tasted as though from a carton of concentrate, muesli way too sweet, fruit salad so sweet as to drown fruit flavour, the small bread flutes tough and dry, or sliced white bread only if you want toast. A nice range of cold meats and cheese but overall you have to expect better at this price. Two minutes away is a fantastic traditional boulangerie. Why don’t the management source from there a decent array of bread. And sugar can always be added to food by individuals but not taken out. A review of the offering is needed in our view.\n",

We partook each night when we were there. - The concierge was friendly.- Water pressure on the shower- Heated towel rack. Not necessary but was soooo nice to have.Mixed:- Smaller sized rooms, but I we picked a small room since we were moving around town. Wish I had known:- About the opera being across the street.

Breakfast is a buffet but includes a bit of everything from a choice of continental to cooked breakfast plus cheese and meats. Also juices, yoghurts and cereals. Something for everyone. The Spa is the big plus for such a small hotel. It's located in the basement and has a tiny swimming pool but also a sauna and a massage bed that's amazing. I didn't have time to use the Spa on this occasion but I tried it on my previous visit and loved it. Prices are reasonable during quiet weeks in Paris but otherwise increase beyond or budget whenever there is a major event in Paris (Salon)\n",

The concierge is able to make very good recommendations for places to eat.

      "  review_body : This review is based on my experience over the last 6 years.My wife and I travel to Paris every year for her birthday and since it is that close to Christmas, we stay at La Maison Favart to enjoy the christmas decorations of Le Printemps and Les Galeries Lafayette next door.The location is obviously key for that trip as you want to have everything available around. Wether you want to enjoy a Ramen in rue Saint Anne, have a fancy lunch around la Madeleine or simply do some shopping and enjoy tons of cakes at Galeries Lafayette, it's all around! The trafic slows down at night and it then become very romantic if you're lucky enough to get some snow.The hotel in itself is quite the place, we have only tried the duplexes and suites but we never had any noise issues. The beds are not as hard as other hotels and most rooms offer a bathtub. Pro-tip: While your other half is in the tub, prepare two flutes of the complimentary champagne and some foie gras toasts with bread from the bakery at Lafayette Gourmet and you should score enough points to last you a lifetime. We are not breakfast people and usually wake up way past breakfast time but we always wake up on time to get the breakfast here and go back to bed afterwards. It's just that good.The rooms are spacious, with a living space that is enough for 2-3 persons. The only important thing to know is that the some of the loft rooms are not tall-persons designed. By that I mean that there is a low wall above the bathroom sink or a low ceiling in the living room. I can't remember the name of the rooms but if you ask the very kind reception, they should be able to tell you which. There is also a spa room now I believe but we never have the time to try it.Yes, I would recommend this hotel and yes, I'm going back there again this winter.\n",

La Masion Favart was perfect for me because I could walk to Montamarte and Gallaries Layfette easily without going into the Metero. The street was quiet, and just one block up there were plenty of restaurants. My room was super comfortable with a cute private courtyard. I picked the inward room thinking it would be quieter even though I read the windows were enforced. The hotel was so quiet, no city noise at all and no internal noise. My neighbor had their radio on all day and later in the evening, and I could only hear it in the hall and not at all in my room.The room had everything I needed, including a free bottle of water each day. The tv even gave me language options and then showed only channels in the language. The room size was typical Paris small, but big enough for me, and large if I counted the courtyard. The breakfast was great, but I choose to eat out on my second day for variety.I didn’t check out the spa or pool. This hotel was definitely a home, and made me feel safe on my own.\n",

It’s sad to leave as it feels so homely! We didn’t get round to using the spa facilities disappointingly but it is just another bonus option if you choose to stay here. Thanks to everyone at La Maison Favart for a wonderful stay!\n",

      "  review_body : The most important positive is that the people who work at La Maison Favart were universally nice. The room was well furnished, the bed was very comfortable. They ticked off all of the boxes, there was even a welcoming bottle of champagne. That being said, the room was very small, barely holding a queen side bed. The location can either be a plus or a minus depending upon your preference. It is on a very small street, which means that it is quite. It is however, reasonable walking distance to almost everything. It is very close to Haussmann Blvd which has the Galerie Lafayette (it is broken up into several mega stores) and Printemps (more upscale). Personally, I wouldn't go near the street, it is a zoo. However, you are within a 2 mile radius of almost anywhere you might want to be as a tourist.\n",

Lucie was also very kind. Easy check in. Breakfast was ok. The location is very quiet so you can get sleep. The small pool and water massage bed were a nice touch since Paris was having a heat wave.\n",

The room was spacious for Europe and so nicely decorated. The bathroom was large and lovely. Our view was of the Opera house and yet was very quiet. Upon arrival a bottle of champagne was sent to the room. Each night they came by with a small delicious cookie. Breakfast was very good and the staff keep it fresh and hot. It included eggs, bacon, sausage, yogurt, variety of cereals, cold cuts, salmon, cheese, pastries, variety of juices, etc. At the end of each day free coffee/tea and homemade pie are served. If you want snacks or drinks there is an honour bar. Although the hotel does not have a restaurant you can order room service. It was quite good. The concierges especially Freddy are very good and can suggest restaurants, activities and order taxis for you. Good variety of free movies on the TV. I would highly recommend this hotel. A truly wonderful place to call “home” while in Paris. \n",

We were in La Petite Masion which is a small apartment/duplex connected to the hotel. We are a family of five and were exceptionally comfortable in our well appointed room. What a great escape this made after long days of museums, shopping and site seeing. The staff was simply wonderful. A special thanks to Louise, Freddy, and Axel who made our stay so much better. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Paris! Additionally, it is close to a small market and has a little authentic French bakery next door at which we obtained many delightfully delicious items. Many fantastic local restaurants are also within blocks. If you are looking for the most amazing French boutique hotel you should choose to stay with La Masion Favart. You will be very happy with your decision!\n",

All the positives are proved correct . Here are some practical realities - Rooms are small. We had a larger than average room . I gather all rooms in Paris are small but be prepared to take small bags .- Facilities are appropriate but nothing exceptional .- Breakfast is average . Two days in a row , the hot items were stone cold . After I complained it transpired that the serving tray heater was left off . Basic mistake but response was rapid once informed . - The bed was super comfortable. Possibly too hard for some but I slept well. - If you want a lie in , forget it , there’s building work close by that will encroach between 8 am ( on the dot ) with jack hammers working through the day .- Clients were couples and business folk. The lounge is attractive but didn’t have any real atmosphere. - Rooms were not unduly noisy in respect of other occupants . - Common areas are clean and fashionably decorated. - There are some great restaurants nearby . Ask Axel the concierge , who was very knowledgeable.Overall , definitely worth being on your pick list and the staff are super pleasant and helpful. \n",

This charming boutique hotel is centrally located to many attractions, but also on a quiet side street that offers restful calm with a unique beautiful view of the Paris Comic Opera and other classic architecture. Some rooms are a little on the smaller side, but are we enjoyed those as well as a suite on our previous visit. Rooms are individually decorated with lovely historical decor but also thoughtfully include every modern amenity. General sitting and breakfast areas are beautiful, and along with a spa, provide various opportunities throughout the day. Service is impeccable- both extremely responsive and friendly. During a spring Paris visit with my family, I had badly injured my wrist while sightseeing but was able to finish my stay partly due to the exceptionally kind support of Maison Favart staff. I highly recommend this hotel - and am already looking forward to the next visit.\n",

      "  review_body : Maison Favart was definitely one of the highlights for our stay in Paris. Here is the breakdown.Staff: Amazing!! ALL of the staff were lovely and ready to assist with any information we needed - Lucie, Axel, Boris and Freddy to the Ladies in the Breakfast area. They were all wonderful. Special kudos to Freddy - he really took great care of us during our entire stay. SInce we were staying for a long period of time, they even lent us a wifi hotspot box for us to use during our stay there. It definitely came in so handy!! It is just those little things that definitely make a difference.Location: Excellent!! You can walk to quite a few places and the metro is right down the block. Metro is super easy to navigate. Right across the street from the Opera House. There were even a few times when we saw them doing some filming and acting across the street. Also, walking distance to a ton of shops and cafes/restaurants. You can find anything and everything in the area.Room: Carmen Duplex. I love this room. Besides the fact that it is purple (my favorite color), I love the whole set-up. It was beautiful and comfortable and having two bathrooms was great. Food/Drinks: Breakfast was excellent. From eggs to cereal to fruit and yogurt, you will not go hungry here. Also, they have a different pie/cake everyday for the guests (free of charge) and a honesty bar where you can get wine, cognac, whiskey, etc. Housekeeping: They were very good. However, not sure if it had to do with our prolonged stay but we did notice that after a while, some items were not getting replaced (e.g., coffee cups, wine glass, sometimes water). There were a few times we had to call or tell Concierge that we needed replacements.Room Service: Not great. It took a very long time and on top of that, food was not really that good. However, I did read in another review that they were looking to revamp that, which would be a very good idea.Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the gym/spa/pool area as we didn't have a chance to use it. Hopefully, we will for the next time. Overall, I would not hesitate to choose Maison Favart whenever we return to Paris. I definitely recommend as you receive those 5 star touches without breaking the bank!!\n",

      "  review_body : The hotel room was excellent. We could see the Eiffel Tower from our window, we just poked our head out, looked to the right and there it was! Rain head shower in the updated bathroom was nice after long day of travel. Breakfast buffet was wonderful; cheeses, meats, fruit, omelet, pastries, tea, orange juice and of course fresh baked croissants. We enjoyed a leisurely breakfast with the Eiffel Tower in the background surrounded by French culture. It was quite memorable. The reason I am writing this review is for a kind young lady named Emilie who helped us even before we arrived. We messaged the hotel with questions before we departed the US and received responses from Emilie right away. We let her know we would be arriving before check in and the room was ready when we arrived 90 minutes early! So nice to have our room ready so we could simply relax after traveling. She suggested restaurants in the area, kept our suitcases safe so we could explore the city the following day, and she called taxi companies when we could not find an Uber. She was there to answer every question and was always was happy to help. Her kindness and generosity with her time was very much appreciated. She deserves to be recognized for her wonderful dedication to her guests. I say “her” guests because it was obvious that she truly cares for people. Thank you Emilie! Best wishes!\n",

      "  review_body : This was my husband’s 1st trip to Paris & I had not been in many years. His only request was a hotel with a view of the Eiffel Tower. I used Trip Advisor and spent, literally, an entire day searching. The la Comtesse exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed 3 nights there and took advantage of early (noon as opposed to 3pm) checkin (€40 additional)Room 602 is wonderfully located on the top floor with a grand view of the tower from our balcony. The beds are super comfortable-not unlike a cruise ship, where the top mattresses are separate, with many bed pillows. There is a Nespresso machine in the room with porcelain cups/saucers (unlike even our high end American hotels) The bathroom has a rain forest shower head plus a heated towel rack.The Metro and several bus stops are conveniently located within a block of the hotel.The small restaurant has a grand selection of breakfast items and they will make you an omelet as well. One afternoon it was drizzly, windy and bitingly cold so we returned to the hotel early and the chef made us soup-served in glass carafes!And, my new love........the coffee machine in the cafe.All of the staff was superb, but the star was the concierge, Jean Michel. Not only was he courteous and helpful, he was constantly going out of his way to make us feel comfortable. He engaged us in conversation and was very tolerant of our attempts to speak French.Fantastic experience-thank you Hotel la Comtesse.\n",

I liked it that it was tucked back a little in the busy city and not on an extremely busy street. You hear some cars and motorcycles on the streets during the day/night but that’s what comes with being in a big city. There was a line of cafés just across the street that were all very good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. There is also a pharmacy, little snack store, AND taxi stand across the street as well which was SO convenient. Our room was cute, very modern, and always clean. It’s a perfect stay for a couple as it was for us on our honeymoon! We would definitely stay here again when we come back to Paris. \n",

We were just walking distance from the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, and Les Invalides. This hotel is on a corner which gives it a semi-flat iron building look. This hotel had a boutique feel, but we didn’t pay outrages boutique prices. The café, La Comtresse, downstairs, not included was perfect. With a bar, pastries, breakfast/lunch, etc. Staff was great, English speaking, friendly, and helpful We had a balcony facing the Eiffel Tower and that was worth it. You could not see the Eiffel tower unless you walked out onto the balcony, but it was perfect. The room decor was so cute. Heated towel rack in the bathrooms. The service was greatIf you are calling in Uber/cab from this location, the one-way streets around the hotel make it confusing on the driver, so give yourself ample time. We walked from this hotel, picked up some lime scooters, rented a motorcycle, enter the entire city and one night. This location was perfect for all of thatThis is a 4 star (our of 4) on Hotels.com. I agree! 5 star on Google for me., and 5 stars on Trip Advisor! \n",

      "  review_body : You’ll always remember the views, not the price!My daughter’s first visit to Paris and I wanted it to be special. I booked the Comtesse room expecting a view. What I didn’t expect was views from all 3 sides! We were given room 406, and I paid extra for early check in (after an 8 hour overnight flight, my 10 year old was very tired). Our room was ready by 11:30am. The room was large enough for the 2 of us. The bathroom was super clean and lovely, with a great shower. Loved how the shower did not drip on the floor when opened. Only complaint, I would like more counter space at the sink for all my lotions and potions:). Heated towel bar is a great feature. We had a window on all 3 sides of the room - huge windows that opened. Nespresso and Tour views in the morning and the light show at night! My child was amazed, it was a dream come true. All staff was pleasant and helpful. Lots of restaurants and shops in the area and the Metro is across the street. Easy walk to the Tour Eiffel. Thank you making my little girls first visit so special!\n",

When we arrived the lady at reception was very pleasant and it was very quick to check in. We immediately went to our room which was extremely clean and tidy. Throughout the stay everyday the room was cleaned and we were given clean towels also. The hotel was a very short walk to the Eiffel Tower and over places. Love all the corner cafes nearby. Especially the hotels cafe where you can sit outside at admire the view. Overall 5/5, you shouldn’t have no hesitation with booking this hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : We booked a room with a direct view of the Eiffel Tower. When we finally got into our room the view of the tower was blocked by a light pole. We paid 440€ per night to get an unobstructed view of it and our view was blocked. When we went to talk to the front desk they told us there were no more rooms available in the same category until the next day. We asked if we could change to a lower category room since we didn’t get the view we PAID for and they said yes, but we wouldn’t get a refund. How are we supposed to move from a 440€ to a 153€ room without getting a refund?!!! The manager of the hotel was so rude when showed our dissatisfaction. He does not care for the customers as he started arguing with me. Also, when I asked to talked to someone else he said he was the manager and I asked to talk to someone higher. His response was “talk to God” So disappointed that we wasted 440€ per night when we could’ve paid less than half for a better view than what we got. Never staying in this hotel again \n",

However, these are not the best characteristics of La Comtesse; the best characteristic is the ample room with the spectacular view of The Eiffel Tower! There are no words to explain that view! In addition every single person on staff was so kind and attentive! The front desk concierge gave us the best recommendations, from restaurants, to transport to champagne, they always pointed in the right direction. The restaurant staff at this hotel is also absolutely amazing, kind and always smiling. For $19 euro ( sounds like a lot but it isn’t—-we had breakfast outside the hotel once and spent more) you get buffet breakfast: coffee, fresh squeezed oj, fresh home made crepe-like croissants, fresh chocolate croissants, made to order eggs any style, a wide selection of ham and cheese, fruits veggies (and you can make a to-go box of croissant sandwiches to get you through lunch). Besides that, the hotel was always clean and quite peaceful. If you are considering it, DO IT! You won’t regret it! \n",

      "  review_body : For my birthday this year I wanted to go to Paris and stay in a room with an Eiffel Tower view. I put in some extensive research into various hotels, checking location, reviews, prices and pictures, and La Comtesse just seemed like it had everything, and after lengthy deliberation, was the one I kept coming back to. I can save you a LOT of time researching and just tell you to go ahead and book here, you will not be disappointed! The unique selling point of this hotel is that every single room boasts a view of the tower, and at very reasonable prices! Most of the rooms have a side view meaning you need to stick your head out of the window or head out onto your balcony (at an additional supplement) to see it, but the hotel has a few rooms with a front-view directly facing the tower which means you can see the tower from the comfort of your bed! These rooms obviously carry a heftier price tag and I couldn’t decide if it would be worth the extra money compared to a very reasonable side-view room. If you’re having the same trouble as I did deciding... JUST BOOK IT!! My jaw nearly hit the floor when we walked in to our room, the view was worth every penny! To wake up and watch the tower at sunrise from my bed was a once-in-a-lifetime experience I will never forget-truly magical! The hotel itself is perfectly located in a quiet neighbourhood 2 mins round the corner from the nearest metro station, making it convenient to explore the rest of Paris, and is a few minutes walk from the famous Rue Cler which has plenty shops, cafes, patisseries and restaurants. There’s a supermarket very close as well, and of course the Eiffel Tower is a short 15 minute stroll away. The hotel has a typical Parisian style but looks very modern and fresh with modern furnishings. There is a lift to access the upper floors. The hotel room and bathroom were immaculate, all amenities provided and ample space. I can’t comment on the breakfast/restaurant or bar as we didn’t use those but they looked lovely in line with the rest of the hotel. I would particularly note the service at La Comtesse as one of its highest assets. We were upgraded free of charge to a roomwith a balcony on arrival (normally a €40pp supplement) which was an added bonus and a really nice touch. The staff on reception were friendly and efficient, and made some great suggestions for lunch in Paris. Very resourceful too as I had forgotten to pack my plug adapter and they immediately had one sent one up to my room. I honestly couldn’t praise this hotel highly enough, yes there are cheaper options but you get what you pay for and all things considered this hotel is an all-round winner! My only regret is that we didn’t stay long enough. Will definitely be back though! \n",

      "  review_body : Hotel La Comtesse was a haven for us during our 7 day stay in Paris. It is in a quieter part of the city but less than a block away from the nearest Metro and bus stop, thus making the more touristy parts incredibly accessible. I cannot praise this hotel enough. The facilities are elegant, the rooms are perfect and most of all, staff was incredibly attentive, professional and provided excellent customer service. \n",

      "  review_body : You will be hard pressed to find a hotel as central, clean and friendly as La Comtesse. We booked a Marquise room and emailed separately to request a balcony, and upon arrival found we were given a free upgrade to a Duchesse with a balcony on the top floor. To upgrade to a balcony room was €40 per night, we only stayed one night, but the additional cost was well worth it as the rooms are equipped with nespresso machines, so my husband and I enjoyed our morning coffee on the balcony with the Eiffel Tower in clear view. The room was very quiet and spotless with a fantastic shower room and separate bath tub, as well as bathrobes and slippers waiting for you in the closet. While this may seem like a trivial note, as a woman with long hair, the hotel supplies shampoo AND conditioner. I’m sure I’m not the only one whose heart sinks when they get to a hotel to find two-in-one hair products. \n",

It's a very short walk to and from the metro and from there you can get to anywhere in Paris pretty quickly. The hotel itself is a comfortable 4-star property. The rooms are not huge, but well laid out and equipped. The bed was extremely comfortable and our room was very quiet. No street noise at all. Front desk staff were very courteous and helpful. There is free coffee and tea in the lobby along with free pastries during much of the day - a very nice touch! The only caveat is that, like many smaller Parisian hotels, it has only a single, tiny, slow elevator. If you're on the 6th floor (as we were), you may occasionally wait a while. But I would happily stay here again.\n",

The Superior room is a nice upgrade for space if you are the typical American traveler that craves a little more space.

The staff kindly upgraded us, rather than just relocate us, and so my wife and and I were really appreciative, since we also got a little under the weather upon arrival here from rainy London. We stayed 5 nights and this is a great location to get to Champs and Arc and subway to anywhere else. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and lots of nice restraurants in the neighborhood.

      "  review_body : Spent 5 nights at this very charming Parisian hotel. It is a few minutes walk from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysees. The Metro is conveniently located around the corner and we used it repeatedly to get around the city. Although, the hotel is close to a major Parisian attraction, it is on a quiet side street and the rooms are not noisy. We booked the Prestige Double Room, which was very spacious, especially the bathroom which had two sinks. It had a cute wrought iron balcony overlooking the street. Christian and the front desk staff were amazing! They were always friendly and eager to help us with all our queries. When we arrived after a long flight from Canada, we were greeted with coffee and croissants as we awaited checkin. The hotel also communicated several times via email before our journey to offer any assistance. They kindly arranged airport transfer to the hotel, a shuttle to the train station on departure and made a dinner reservation ahead of our stay for our anniversary dinner at a special restaurant that only accepted phone bookings. We really appreciated the kindness of all the staff and will definitely stay at this hotel the next time we visit Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : What is there not to like about this hidden gem of a hotel in Paris! Excellently located right around from the Arc de Triomphe, this hotel oozes charm and elegance. Fantastic welcome and charming staff helped make this stay very memorable for many reasons. Boutique rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Breakfast, although basic, provided a great start to the day with the salon bar offering a wind down for the evening. If you are looking for a comfortable stay with no 'airs and graces', but still with elegance and charm, this is the one for you.\n",

The location is amazing and it is a short walk to some fantastic sights (I.e. Champs-Élysées and Arc De Triomphe) and the metro is just around the corner. We stayed in a suite with two adults and two small children and it was perfect. Nicely kept and clean. The breakfast was great.

First allow me to say, this was our first trip to Europe and I’m so glad I lucked out and chose this gem of a hotel. The manager Christian and the entire staff were extremely accommodating and helpful throughout our stay. The hotel is perfectly situated around the corner from the CDG Etoile Metro stop (across from the Arc de Triomphe). The hotel is in convenient walking distance from several nearby cafes/bars and (Le Vin Coeur, L’ Etoile 1903, Madam Monsieur, Cafe Brasserie and L’ Arc Café to just name a few). Our room was located on the second floor overlooking the outdoor courtyard. From what I read, Parisian hotels rooms are typically small, however my wife and I found our room to be cozy, comfy and pleasantly quiet. The beds were quite comfortable and the AC unit worked adequately (we were there during the Paris heatwave!). Christian and staff assured all our requests were met (i.e. hotel transport, room selection and a celebratory bottle of champagne) and their amenities were top notch. The breakfast (which is non-continental) was delicious also.All in all, our Paris trip was quite a rewarding and memorable experience, however our stay at the Hotel Balmoral made it that much more enjoyable. I highly recommend it. Au revoir!\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed at the Hotel Balmoral from 06/06-09/19. The hotel is located very close to the Arch de Triumphe. A taxi ride from Orly Airport will set you back about 100 Euros. I recommend you do not take a taxi, but instead use Le Bus for 13 Euros. Back to my hotel review. When I started up the side street this hotel is located on, I said to myself, uh oh .. not good. The street was completely torn up and under construction. I had a little sidewalk path to take. But once in the hotel, it was nice, quiet and comfortable. I was warmly greeted and check-in was a breeze. I was shown to the 4th floor where my room was ample and comfortable. The bed was especially comfortable and it was quiet. I did not have a view. Big deal. They have appetizers and drinks from 5 to 7 p.m. in the hotel restaurant. The drinks are not free and they are pricey, but the appetizers are free. The best part about this hotel besides it being quiet was that it is close to the subway. Within easy walking distance ... say 50 yards. The Arch is just another 50 yards. And there is plenty of taxi services if you want one. I didn't. Reminder: There is a Le Bus pickup and drop off right near the subway, so use it! It was only 13 Euros back to the airport. It was quick too! Much faster than the taxi.Overall, I really enjoyed this hotel. I would recommend it and I would / will stay here again. By the way, the roadway in front of the hotel was completed within the few days I was there and now construction has ended.\n",

Overall this felt like a hotel in a state of decline. Creaky floors might be expected and even charming at your grandma's house, but not at a 4-star hotel. From the lobby to the elevator to the room itself, everything just felt old, not classical or vintage. The services offered were laughably expensive. Offering laundry service at your hotel \"checks the box\" so you can get a 4 star rating; charging $3 for every pair of socks washed ensures that no one in their right mind will actually use the laundry service.The price for hotels in this area is steep, so perhaps it's inevitable to be disappointed. If you're dead set on staying at a 4-star hotel or above, I recommend venturing a little further away from the center of Paris near a Metro station. You'll get better value.\n",

We noticed this within the first 30 minutes and I will say that the hotel handled our concerns well and provided us with an alternative room (which was actually much bigger, which we appreciated).With that being said, even the upgraded room did not really compensate for what this hotel was lacking. Our bathroom in the new room had a broken tile. Further, the rooms have zero noise cancellation, so you can hear every door shut or open, every voice, etc. especially at night. By far the biggest complaint of mine is the service. This is a 4-star hotel in Paris. Guests are paying a considerable amount and are expecting 4-star service. This hotel did not provide that. With the exception of Yoni, who was very kind, everyone else we spoke with throughout our stay seemed unhappy and irritated. We even caught one of the receptionists roll her eyes at guests who came and asked for something. When you walk into your hotel lobby, you expect at least a smile. The majority of the people who work at this hotel do not seem to want to be there and it shows. We felt extremely cheated, considering this was a pricier option for us and we booked it expecting an exceptional experience.All in all, I would not recommend. I think that you can spend much less and get better service and better quality rooms (without as many defects). I am hoping that my experience is a one-off...\n",

Breakfast was just great and really loved the afternoon tea they supplied from 3pm to 6pmit was delicious. We had to leave early on the shuttle bus and we didnt have to ask for an early breakfast. Reception just made it so so easy. Thank you all at the Hotel Cambon if we are fortunate enough to travel to Paris again I would not stay anywhere else. The air conditioning was also very very appreciated in the heat wave that hit Paris while we were there (42degrees can you believe)\n",

      "  review_body : If you want to stay in the most amazing, central location without the price tag of the Ritz, you owe it to yourself to check Hotel Cambon. We chose it for the location and convenience. Location was our highest consideration on this short trip to Paris with our children -- their first visit. That said, within the central \"walking distance to everything\" locations, this was by far the most amazing value we found. Before we arrived, they were already helping us, answering silly questions about local traffic, hairdryers, etc. and even making a few dinner reservations for us (what a convenience for a few places we liked that didn't have online booking) which they confirmed by email but also presented to us when we arrived. Like having a personal assistant (perhaps I should have used them more!). Having now been, we can recommend it also for the comfortable rooms and friendly service! It's a small hotel, so you see the same few faces each day as you come and go. They mailed our postcards and helped with luggage. The room was small -- as you might imagine -- but fit us very well. It was difficult to find accommodations for four and the room arrangement here was perfect. The bed was large (felt almost like a king?) with an adjoining full room (smaller bed) for our daughters (10 & 14). There was a fridge in each room (we stored our macarons!) but no coffee facility unless you do the hotel breakfast, which we did not. We found coffee and croissant near our first sight each day. On our last day my (kind/generous!) husband went to Happy Cafe (found here on TA) to bring in breakfast as we packed up. LBNL, the bathrooms were sparkling and I love a bright white duvet -- this was my favorite bed of three hotels on this trip. Highly recommend this hotel. We'll be back!\n",

Breakfast was really nice.

The room was nice, there was some sort of mix up when we were checking in so our room was upgraded upon arrival which I truly appreciated. We also paid to be picked up from the airport through the hotel, and our ride was on time and easy to find. However, as we were checking out, the staff at the front desk asked that we confirm that we had two coffees at breakfast. When we claimed that we did not have coffees, instead of taking our word for it, the person behind the front desk proceeded to call over other staff members who claimed to see us drinking coffee at breakfast. It was all very bizarre, and really rude- Especially to my significant other who cannot drink caffeine due to a heart condition and was very offended and frustrated. Why argue and embarrass us over two cups of coffee that we did not have? I don't often write a bad review- and I do have to note the positives mentioned above- but this interaction left a really bad taste in my mouth.\n",

I’d also say that the 4 star rating is certainly not accurate - it’s 3 stars at best. I was travelling alone and booked a room with a double bed. However, in reality the rooms have two single beds pushed together (see the photo) which kept moving apart all night and left me with an aching back and a terrible headache due to getting only 2 hours sleep. When I asked the reception if they could give me a room for the 2nd night with one proper bed they said they were fully booked so I was stuck with it as every other hotel in the area was now also fully booked. Never had a problem at even the most budget hotel in Paris before.

The neighborhood is very cute and loaded with cute boutiques.The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We started most mornings with the breakfast buffet. And the coffee was wonderful.

      "  review_body : Just returned from a 5 day stay in Paris where we stayed at the Hotel Splendid Etoile and I cannot say enough good things about the hotel and staff. The location and views from the hotel were fantastic. The hotel is located only one block from the the Arc de Triomphe and the views from the balcony (I stayed in Room 506) were unbelievable. It was enjoyable to sit out every night on the balcony to unwind, watch and listen to the sights and sounds on the street while having the best view of the Arc de Triomphe that you could imagine. The Metro station is only a short block away, the stop for the Hop on Hop Off Big Bus is also a short walk away (and recommended to get an overview of Paris). The room was large, modern and clean with a comfortable bed, safe and mini fridge. The lobby and bar were quaint and attractive and for breakfast there was a good buffet with eggs, bacon, sausage, fruits, cereal, juice and all the croissants you can eat. Above all, the staff, and in particular the Chief Concierge Farooq, was the most amazing staff of any hotel that I have ever stayed in. The concierge staff of Farooq, Abboud and Levis were beyond helpful and patient. In need of a wheelchair, Abboud walked more than two blocks to a pharmacy to arrange for the rental of a wheelchair. Farooq set us up with not only great tours, but he saved us ,money and time with his advice and planning above and beyond what I have ever experienced in my substantial travels. My stay at the Hotel Splendid Etoile can only be described in two words, Magnifique! Magnifique!\n",

      "  review_body : I always take a few nights on a long trip at a hotel that has something special in order to create a lasting memory. After the fiascos I had at the previous two hotels on my 24 day journey I was looking forward to my 4 night suite stay at the Splendid Etoile. The suite is on the top floor has no balcony but what a view of the Arc de Triomphe from the Tv room window and while sitting on the sofa I could also see the top half of the Eiffel Tower out the bedroom window. A great ending to a long trip. Now that is why I spent a little extra money for a few nights. You can occasionally hear the sirens of emergency vehicles but it didn't bother me.The subway and RER is literally right out the front door and will take you anywhere as it is a major intersection. Shopping is right down the Champs Elysees and connecting streets. The major department stores are a short ride to the Opera district. The room was immaculately clean, had hot water after waiting a little bit, and they provided 2 free 1/2 bottles of water daily. The minifridge was great for my medicine. There are a few items I would recommend be addressed.I requested the front desk change my mattress because it was hard as a rock. I was told not to worry it would be taken care of. Never happened. So I took the two duvets off the beds and folded them and made a pillow top mattress that was much better and my back did not complain after that. I think the hotel should have some spare mattresses for people who want a different experience than rock hard.The restaurant is adequate for the convenience but I thought the breakfast is to pricey for there wasn't anything special about it. There are cafes and bakeries that you can get the same for much less. And the dinner menu doesn't really have a vegetarian main course.The bath robes are not soft, very scratchy and not pleasant to wear. On many occasions I heard my door open and it was the house service. They never knocked before opening the door. I made my displeasure known to one of them.The room décor was recently updated to a contemporary simplistic design. This is common with most recent hotel updates as they are using grey, silver or white as the principal color - in this case grey. I like warmth and natural wood tones, especially the traditional French walnut of the period of the architecture of the building. The entire room and furniture is grey with a few accents of orange and blue and I admit it is tastefully done. As realtors always tell home sellers the number one color never to use in a home besides black is grey. Very depressing. However I did not rent the room for the décor as much for the view which was worth it.Besides the mattress issue, the staff were very helpful and I highly recommend the hotel.\n",

The staff were, on the whole, very personable and we appreciated the frequent touch of good humour from the guest relations/concierge team. Our room was beautiful and we enjoyed the view; though I would note that rooms on the first floor (as ours was), have a slightly obstructed view of the Arc due to the trees. We had requested a higher floor by email but it was not possible to allocate this when we checked in. That said, you are so very close to the monument itself that it does not matter all that much and it would not stop us returning to this hotel on future stays at all. The room was very clean and the toiletries/slippers/robes etc of good standard for a 4* establishment. The breakfast was yummy - perhaps the best pancakes/wagfles I’ve had in a good while, with very fresh and juicy blueberries. Thank you to all the team for a great stay in Paris. \n",

Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff at the front desk, Benji (Concierge) and Levi. Both offered many suggestions of places we could visit, tours and restaurants in the area. Our room was not ready upon our arrival so they offered to store our bags so that we could go out and explore Paris right away. Yasser at the reception desk contacted the staff preparing our room and expedited the preparation of our room. So we didn't have to wait too long. Yasser even let me go see the room and allowed me to pick one with a shower instead of a tub. Our room was beautiful, spacious, bright, clean and very cool. (It was very hot during our stay). Our room had a breathtaking view of the Arc de Triomphe. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and we loved coming back to our room every night after a long day of tours and shopping. The bath toiletries were made with honey and smelled amazing. We had a romantic breakfast on our balcony one morning and experienced a beautiful sunrise. The hotel is located steps away from the metro and very close to everything. Champs de Elysees was close by so we could walk comfortably there whenever we wanted. Farooq, Chief Concierge was fabulous, he helped us get taxi's and always provided tips whenever we went out for the day. He made sure we were safe and never went into any dangerous places. There were several bakeries nearby and we would walk a few blocks to our favorite one which served delicious chocolate croissants and pastries. Lots of restaurants to eat nearby also. We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful hotel and we will definitely be back when we come back to Paris! Top notch hotel!\n",

If you buy the 10-pack of Metro passes at the station, you can get nearly everywhere you want to go. The hotel is classy, nice. Our room was spacious and the view from the balcony was so special. Around 9pm the Arc just lit up with the setting sun and it was spectacular. The room has double-doors between the balcony and the bedroom. Despite being in a busy area, right on the street, we slept soundly with little to no noise. This was the only hotel we didn't include breakfast in our room rate, because, well, you're in Paris! I didn't miss it. We found plenty of places nearby for a croissant and coffee. Key management was interesting. A physical key is attached to an \"anchor\" that is heavy. The idea is you return the key/anchor to the front desk before leaving the hotel and retrieve it upon your return. They manage it well; we were never really grilled or asked to provide ID. I think they get to know your face and it really isn't a big deal, just different. All in all this was probably my favorite hotel during our 2-week Europe romp and I would highly recommend staying here.\n",

      "  review_body : For our eighth trip to Paris, we decided to splurge and stay in a hotel with a view of a monument. This hotel did not disappoint! We stayed in a Superior balcony room with a perfect view of the Arc de Triomphe. The balcony had a small table and chairs where we enjoyed Champagne every night. Service was helpful and friendly. The entrance to the Charles de Gaulle–Étoile metro stop is right across the street. You can also catch a bus that goes straight to CDG for €18 right across the street. The front desk sells tickets for the bus. Just some things to keep in mind, this hotel is on a busy street so there is some street noise, also the balconies are connected to each other so you may not always have privacy if your neighbors are on their balcony as well. As I mentioned, it was a splurge but it was worth it to do once!\n",

As with most of Paris it is located in an old structure that has been fully renovated inside. The rooms are very comfortable - on the small side, as they are in NYC but elegant nevertheless. It’s very near the Arc de Triumph and the Champs-Elysees and the Paris Metro. We had a beautiful buffet breakfast every morning that was delicious and the staff could not have been more helpful. If we return to Paris anytime soon, we will almost certainly re-book with the Splendid Etoile.\n",

      "  review_body : The biggest selling point for booking this hotel was the proximity to the Arc de Triomphe and it is literally right next to it. Very easy to walk anywhere in the area and there is a Metro stop literally right across the street. The head concierge was wonderful in helping us to arrange for a babysitting service before we came and we couldn't have been happier with the babysitter that was provided. We also arrived earlier than expected (prior to check-in time), but we were given a room almost immediately anyway (which we did not expect or ask for)...but it gets even better because as soon as we walked in our room we were called back because they were giving us a bigger room with more space for a baby crib. They also provided a very nice touch by giving our baby daughter a stuffed rabbit (we visited a week prior to Easter). I also can't say enough good things about the breakfast...a very large spread of delicious French food.\n",

The thing i liked the most about this Hotel is the unbeatable location next to arc de triomphe and the central three-line metro station Charles De Gaulle, which allow you to visit most of the attractions easily. Breakfast was good, staff was friendly, but unfortunately I couldn't enjoy much because my wallet was stolen in metro station a few hours before checking in, so i spent half of my stay following up with police station and lost-and-found department with no luck. Hotel have nothing to do with this, so i thought it's fair to give it this high rating.\n",

When we arrived around 11.00 a.m. we were greeted with a particularly warm welcome and offered a coffee. Understandably, our room was not ready. We were provided with lots of advice regarding tourist tips and our bags were securely stored at the hotel while we walked around this beautiful city. When we returned in the evening, our bags were waiting for us in our room. When we opened the curtains we were truest amazed at the stunning view of the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is very clean and well run. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. Breakfasts were lovely....lots of choice and served in a side room with views of the Arc de Triomphe. Tea and coffee served by a very pleasant waiter. We loved our stay at the Splendid Etoile and are already planning a return visit in the autumn.\n",

      "  review_body : Returning to Paris after several years, I wanted a special hotel to celebrate a milestone birthday. I researched all the hotels near the Arc de Triomphe and made the right decision for our 5 night stay. We arrived in the early morning and the staff was so welcoming and delivered our luggage to our suite later in the day while we became Parisians (Thank you Farook). Although everyone spoke English, my husband was able to speak French and they all were gracious when I spoke bits of French mixed in with Spanish.This is probably the first time I found the photos of the room to be accurate. When we entered our suite, it felt like home. The view of the Arc was spectacular and I spent every morning, afternoon and evening just watching \"Paris\" through the window. The Eiffel Tower was also visible.We decided to pay for the breakfast and for us it was worth it. The buffet has a variety of delicious items to fill up on before walking in this spectacular city.

The competition is quite big for the hotels in the area offering Arc the Triumph views but I’m sure not all are equally great in every aspect. I did my research and I must say the hotel exceeded our expectations. We are well traveled couple, it was my first time in Paris and third time for my husband. We’ve arrived at the hotel around 10am and were very pleased to receive an early check in. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. We’ve had a corner room, it was spacious, nicely decorated, it felt like we were the very first guests to stay in it - that’s how fresh it was. Lovely bathroom, great shower. Room Views of the Arc the Triumph were spectacular. We’ve had 3 balconies from which we’ve had the Arc views. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to main attractions as well as the metro is just across the road. Perfect stay! Will definitely come back to this hotel and will recommend to family and friends. \n",

      "  review_body : I stayed in the privilege room for 3 nights (this is currently my last night), and I do not want to check out. This has truly been an amazing experience. The entire front desk team and housekeepers were incredibly polite and professional. The moment I got out of my taxi, someone was outside to take my bags. I spend the days around Paris and come back to a clean and comfortable room. I ordered breakfast to my room and it was delivered quickly, hot and fresh. I asked for extra bottles of toiletries, a hair comb, an iron and ironing board, dinnerwear and silverwear, and they were immediately delivered. You have complete views of Paris with extremely close, unobstructed views the Arc de Triomphe from your bedroom and bathroom. You can also see the Eiffel Tower from both points as well. Their light show is great at night. The bathtub was amazing and the water pressure was great. The bed was comfortable. The hotel is fairly quiet. It honestly sounds like I am being paid for this review, but I am normal guest from New York that appreciates good hospitality and the entire staff went above and beyond to meet my expectations. I am here for 3 more days and staying in another hotel in and different part of the city and I am sad I am leaving tomorrow, but I will absolutely stay here again when I come to Paris for the entire stay. Thanks so much. Merci!\n",

Getting gassed getting back to the hotel was pretty awful, but they bent over backwards to help us stay safe. No issues once we were inside and warm. Rooms are on the small side but this is Paris. If you want more space, pay up for a Jr. Suite. I found the bed perfect and overall it was a good experience. Great if you only factor in the things in their control. Didn't bother with the hotel breakfast or their restaurant. I prefer a patisserie for breakfast and there are thousand of restaurants in Paris to choose from.

I kindly explained that we had booked 2 rooms with a view, and I was told I only had one room with a view. Since the view costs more, which I had gladly paid, this was unacceptable. After about 30 minutes of the front desk staff attempting to screw us over, they finally gave us a second room with a view. Obviously, they had this room available, since we ended up in it, but were just being jerks and trying to screw us out of what we'd paid for. They were rude throughout the process and didn't apologize. The poor service continued the next morning at checkout, when I was told I'd only paid for one room. I informed the man at the desk that I'd paid for both rooms in full and he again tried to push me on it. Luckily I knew what I'd paid and didn't let him charge me again.

Besides the prefect view od Arc de Triomphe and the excellent location where we could go almost all famous places in Paris on foot or by metro in less than 20 mins or around 30 mins, the room was very clean and comfortable making us really had a great time for our stay. The nice and friendly front desk staff in fact offered 24 hours services and assistances. The housekeeping staff offered room made-up services every morning after we went out. It was really a great and lovely surprise for us when we came back and saw they had put my boys' soft toys on bed so nice. In addition, hotel does offer full set of NUXE cleaning and skin care products in the washroom. Go there when you are planning to visit Paris.\n",

The location was terrific - a short walk to the Champs Élysées, some excellent restaurants nearby, and above the Charles de Gaullist-Etoile station (RER A and 1,2 & 6) so an easy ride to pretty much anywhere. The staff were particularly helpful, with great advice and helped us arrange some excellent day trips.\n",

Opposite the metro exit. Very easy to get to Disney if that’s on your agenda as the RER stops here.Didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment.Staff could not have been more friendly & helpful. Mostly they spoke good English but still encouraged my French! They looked after our bags on our last day, opened the safe with a smile when I jammed it & walked us out round the corner to point out how to find the entrance to the Arc de Triomphe.Highly recommend.\n",

It’s a short walk to St Germain and close to many restaurants if you want to be able to walk to dinner.We had a deluxe room which was a good size and super comfortable with a bathtub and separate stand-alone shower which helped with unwinding after a long day of sightseeing. The shower also has essential oils which is such a lovely addition to this still quite new hotel. The TV is also a smart tv so you can relax with a movie with access to Netflix etc.The hotel staff were also very friendly and will definitely be back for the next visit to Paris.\n",

As described by other reviewers, the location is central to everything that Paris has to offer. Major sites are a quick walk or Metro ride away. Hotel Moliere is a 29 room boutique hotel that quickly becomes home with it many amenities and comfortable rooms. What really sets this hotel apart is the people who work there. There was nothing too small to ask for assistance with and we found that virtually every staff member who cared for us were always pleasant and professional. Individuals like Anang, Grace, Yang, Sergei and Vladimir (many others as well) quickly became our friends. Our Parisian friends that visited us at Hotel Moliere were likewise impressed and they too were treated like valued guests. We recommend this hotel and will return!!\n",

      "  review_body : This is a lovely hotel in an excellent location - within walking distance to the Louvre, more than one Metro station, shops, restaurants, and markets. The building itself is beautiful and has been converted into a hotel. As a result, the rooms are quite small and quirky, but that lends itself to the charm. My sister and I shared a room for three nights and had more than enough space and felt quite comfortable. The one aspect we did not love was the glass wall in our shower/sink room, made it quite impossible to have any privacy whilst showering. Since we are sisters, it was not a huge deal, but a bizarre aspect of decor. Our mother was on a higher floor (top floor) with a courtyard-facing window (as our own) and she complained of the smell of cooking food coming into her room. We did not experience the same smell. The hotel breakfast was lovely, with fresh and delicious food and a large variety. The staff at both front desk, breakfast room, and housekeeping were all lovely, and all patiently helped me with my rudimentary French. The breakfast area has an honor bar for use later in the day, which was handy for a glass of wine after a long day.Will definitely be returning.\n",

      "  review_body : A very central location and lovely reception staff – Anang/Eka and Ana.The hotel is only 5 minutes walk from the Pyramides Metro station. Opera, Galeries Lafayette, Tuileries, Rue de Rivoli, the Louvre and much more are all within easy walking distance.We had a “club” room was at the top on floor 7.A bit small, but with large skylight and a window over the inner courtyard (not much to look at!).There was a motorised blind (very noisy, which did not stop automatically at the extremes of the window unless a central button on the remote was pressed. The motorised screen remote worked well. There was a welcome gift and a turn down every night. The room was clean, except that there were 2 dark circles on the grey headboard that we saw once the cushions were removed ! Possibly, due to previous guests’ hair over a period of time and difficult to wash ?!Could still replace the headboard. The bathroom had a good shower. The mirror was a bit far away and the side mirror was not that useful. All of the staff were friendly.The breakfast was limited, but adequate. Only one juice, which was orange. Some fruit was available and some packaged madeleine cakes, which were useful for trips. Cereal, cold meats and yoghurts also limited, but present. There is a small section of sausage/scrambled eggs and bacon too.They do allow you to have hot drinks through the day, which is nice.We booked a taxi with Ana at reception to go the CDG airport the next day. We were told that it would be about 50-55 euros, as we expected. The next day, Eka phoned them as well. A mini-bus 7 seater came on time. There was no unusual traffic problem, but when we got to CDG the driver said the cost was 77 euros!! I protested, but the driver said that the 7 seater cost more and that the “uber cars” were busy ?? None of this explained the charge far in excess of what we were told by the hotel, but we paid up. I did phone Eka afterwards to tell her what had happened. Obviously, it makes you think about who the Hotel Moliere uses for taxis. So beware! Our stay was good , except for the taxi service that the hotel ordered\n",

      "  review_body : We chose the Moliere because of its proximity to many of the sites we wanted to see in Paris. For instance, it was a two-minute walk from the Pyramides Metro stop, which gave us easy access to the city. It was a 10-15 minute walk from the Louvre and not that much further to other monuments and attractions...and was a one-minute stroll from Avenue de l'Opera.All of that would not have meant diddly, however, if the hotel was not a solid value for the money. We paid more than we would have for a hotel not as centrally located, but also got a very nice room...one with a bath and shower (glass walls with drapes, so not for everyone)....in-room nectar, tea, coffee and water on the house and doors as windows that opened out onto Rue Moliere.Our higher rate also provided us with a full breakfast each morning, which included a traditional continental breakfast, along with scrambled eggs, sausage and coffee to order. Newspapers were available in several languages.The elevator was a touch quirky....to go down in the elevator from the third floor, you had to hit the \"up\" button, which lit up, followed by the \"down\" button, which did not.Housekeeping was solid, even providing us with chocolates on our pillows in the evenings. The staff was friendly, speaking both English and French...helping this guy, who tried to use his high school French to moderate avail. They helped us book a taxi to CDG, telling us it might take an hour to get there; on an early Sunday morning, it only took a half an hour with virtually nobody else on the road.You're going to pay more for the Hotel Moliere than you might at another facility, but if you do, I think you'll appreciate the price/value ratio.\n",

What sets it apart, though, is the fantastic staff: everyone is warm, welcoming, friendly, and helpful. I spent 3 weeks at Hotel Moliere in April-May, have just booked another visit for a week in September, and have stayed several other times in the past - each visit has been perfect, and I happily recommend the hotel to my friends. I am usually in Paris for work, so after a busy day, I especially enjoy using the well-equipped fitness room. A sauna and hammam are also available. Breakfasts are delicious - many different hot and cold choices, with lots of fresh fruit. I usually book one of the larger rooms, which are quite spacious, but even the smaller ones are larger than typical for Paris. The hotel is located on a quiet street lined with small restaurants and shops, plus many more choices on nearby streets. I'm already looking forward to my next Paris visit.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed at the Hotel Moliere for 5 nights at the end of July. We picked it from 5 hotels offered by our travel agent because of its location. From check in until departure it was the best small hotel experience I have ever had in any hotel in my life and I’m 70. The location, the hotels quirkiness, the rooms, history, facilities and most of all the staff were all exceptional, I can’t say enough. Firstly the room, our room was small but adequate; it provided everything we needed from a comfortable bed, quirky on suite, free pod coffee, tea, bottled water and fruit juice and a fridge mini bar. Our first day coincided with the hottest day Paris has ever had, nearly 43C. the A/C was great maintain a constant 23C in the room. The public areas we wonderful; an eclectic mix of themed (Moliere) historic and ultra-modern. The location is also wonderful, from the supermarket 50 meters from the hotel, many local restaurants, to the Louvre a block away and through the Louvre square to the River Seine, we were within walking distance of everything. Finally the staff, great reception staff, helped us with everything from familiarisation with room, organising tours, arranging check out needs and just being there with a bright friendly greeting. I also suggest you include breakfast, a great way to start the day and the staff make the experience feel like the best bed and breakfast you have ever stayed in. I can’t say enough about this hotel; it is now the only hotel I would stay in in Paris\n",

      "  review_body : Having decided (way too) late to spend a few days in Paris at the end of last year we were really happy to find a room at Hotel Moliere. The hotel’s location on Rive Droite (the right bank of the Seine River), on the quieter part of rue Molière, is excellent. There is little traffic, major sights, like the Louvre Museum, are within easy walking distance and there are restaurants close by. We liked the well-designed and stylish lobby and breakfast area featuring references to the work of French Playwright Moliere after whom the hotel is named. We had room 02 on the ground floor at the rear looking out over a green courtyard. Because the view was spoiled by the scaffolding for ongoing works we were offered free breakfast for the duration of our stay in compensation. Our room was spacious (for Paris) and the bedding was very good. We appreciated the wooden floors and the coffee and tea making facilities. Except for some noise in the morning from upstairs neighbours, our room was quiet. Breakfast - in the breakfast room or in the room at no extra cost – was very nice. There was a good choice of sweet and savoury items and fresh fruit. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel Moliere did not come cheap, but it offered value for money.\n",

There is absolutely no where to put your clothes ( there used to be a bench at the end of the bed where you could stack clothing- not anymore!).The renovation of the lobby is beautiful.The front desk was very friendly except for one women - short hair and glasses - who shouldn’t be in the hospitality industry because she is not service oriented. Example: on our third day there breakfast, which we paid extra for was a disappointing. There was not enough food on display, servers were new and just came out to move an empty platter to a new location. When we complained and said that we would not like to pay for the breakfast on this day, and the next 2 days, she gave us a really hard time.We will be staying elsewhere on our next visit to Paris.\n",

It is an excellent boutique hotel in a great location. The staff was especially helpful in making restaurant reservations even in advance of our arrival and assisting with other services such as hiring reliable transport to CDG and even assisting with our flight check in. The property is kept immaculately and the rooms are comfortable as well as sizeable. It truly is an excellent place to stay in Paris\n",

      "  review_body : Our group of 2 couples recently stayed at Le Six for 4 nights. We had booked Superior class rooms. We chose Le Six after a long internet search and upon reading the reviews on TA. We were so very glad we chose Le Six!Our room was nicely laid out with a short hallway at the entrance which housed a good sized closet (plenty of hanging space and shelves). There was more storage in a wall unit which held the Nespresso machine. The room itself was not large but a pretty good size by Paris standards. Plenty of outlets and USB ports. The bathroom was small but had a large walk in shower, which worked great. The breakfast room was small but well staffed and the buffet provided everything anyone could want.The staff was very friendly and eager to help. There was a public transit strike the day we were to leave Paris so the staff arranged for a private car to take us to our train station as they knew we would never get a taxi. We also enjoyed discussions with the gentleman manning reception at night. He gave us good suggestions for dinner in the neighborhood. BTW there are 2 small local restaurants with very good food on Rue Stanislas (same owner who was super friendly and helpful) and many more around the corner on Rue Montparnesse. There are Metro stops nearby and several attractions within walking distance.Le Six provides a solid 4 star experience at prices below those hotels closer to the Seine. We will definitely return to this hotel on our next Paris trip.\n",

Our room had a balcony overlooking the street, which allowed me to take some great pictures. The room was supplied with a Nespresso machine, a tea kettle, bath robes and slippers, bottled water every day, a clean large bathtub if you prefer a bath vs a shower, L’Occitane toiletries, and complimentary chocolate upon arrival. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the balcony at night and making short trips to a natural food market as well as a pharmacy for some top notch beauty products. The front desk staff was very accommodating for our lack of French and always spoke in English when addressing us. They were so pleasant and courteous at all times.

But what it lacked in walking room, it made up for in comfort and style. The luxurious and comfortable beds were much needed for our tired, jet lagged bodies, especially after a day of sightseeing. The bathroom was spacious and serene. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and the lounge in the lobby was a stylish oasis and the perfect spot to relax before heading out for the day. The hotel location is also perfect for exploring Paris, between two Metro lines and amidst dozens of great restaurants. I highly recommend a nearby creperie called Le Petit Josselin. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely return.\n",

I liked everything but the breakfast; not a great variety and not all covered so the flies were having a ball.

They were helpful in making dinner reservations and seeing if I needed any taxi services. The level of customer service was well above most hotels and it has convinced me to return to Paris sooner than I had planned. When I return, I will be staying with Hotel Le Six. The location can't be beat as far as I'm concerned...I like the quiet street where it is located. The rooms are well appointed, nothing left to be desired. The air conditioning was such a relief when we arrived after a heat wave in France and traveling through areas that didn't have much in the way of AC. Did I mention the shower?? OMG, it is terrific! They also have a Nespresso in the room that was well used while I was there. One morning while there I had breakfast and it was very good. I don't know how many people in the hotel eat breakfast there as I was the only one in the dining area at the time, but there was a good variety of food and all was delicious. The only thing I will do differently next time I go is request a larger room. I had a superior room (mid size) and would spring for a little more space...and a bath tub. I was wanted to soak in a tub a couple of nights after long days of walking. Overall, the stay was fantastic, and I'm looking forward to another trip soon.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed in Hotel Le Six for 6 nights. My agent had made the booking for us and breakfast was included. Our total stay was good, we had good clean rooms, the size of the rooms was good, and the breakfast was also nice, the staff was friendly and helpful. The last night when I needed to checkout at 4 am in the morning I approached the reception asking for settlement of a security deposit that was charged on my card the day I checked in and at that time was told that this is just a security and will be refunded when i check out. I was told by the ladies sitting at the reception that I will get it tomorrow morning when I check out. I agreed and went to my room. That night around 10 pm when I returned to the hotel after dinner the desk was occupied by a man, who looked quite unpleasant in his behaviour which I ignored. I asked him for a bottle of water in my room and he said he was not my servant and that I should take the bottle at the desk itself, I did that and left just thinking it was just a bad mood syndrome. The next morning at around 4 I went to the desk and asked the gentleman about my security deposit. He looked quite upset and started pacing the lobby and going out the door to get some fresh air. I asked him if he was sleepy and he nodded his head. After waiting for a moment or two a little disturbed by his behaviour I asked him to switch on the lights of the lobby and he just started shouting at me saying he will not. I was honestly taken aback and my little girl was frightened. He started shouting at me saying racist comments. He admitted that he doesnt work for the Hotel and he works for a security company, and he doenst care what I felt or thought about the Hotel. It was the worst 15 minutes of my whole trip and my daughter and myself were so shocked and were relieved only when the cab pickup driver came in. The guy even said quite a few things about us to the taxi guy which were in French and all I could make out was that he was saying rude remarks. It is very unprofessional of the Hotel to leave the desk to somebody outside of the Hotel who didnt care how the guest felt like. When I said to the guy that I need to talk to someone from the hotel he just said he didnt care what I felt like, and also asked me to go ahead and call the Police.In the morning from the airport around 7am I called up the hotel again to talk to the receptionist. I told her everything and she said that the money will be refunded to me only later. I asked her I am a tourist and how does she except me to be refunded that money. Secondly she also told me that I have an outstanding of 6 mornings of breakfast. I told her that is not right coz my booking includes breakfast and even if that was the case why was I not told that yesterday night when I came to the reception. I asked her do you wait for clients to checkout of the hotel and then inform all this. I am shocked at the unprofessional behaviour of this hotel, notwithstanding to mentioning the fact that me and my daughter were made to wait 20 minutes for the spa despite making the booking long before. I had a dinner reservation but my daughter really wanted to do it so I agreed to wait. My experience speaks a lot for itself and I have nothing more to say.\n",

We got out room around 11:00am so we were able to freshen up after our flight from the US before going out to explore the city. Staff was super accommodating and helpful, with special thanks to Pauline and Angela who went out their way to make sure that our stay was the best that it could be. THANK YOU HOTEL LE SIX. We will spread the word and be back to visit the next time we are in Paris.\n",

The neighborhood is great just a fast walk to the wonderful Luxembourg Gardens and many other sites. We stayed in a Jr. Suite with a King bed and a little extra room which was wonderful. The bed was cozy and the bathroom had all modern fixtures and amenities. We would love to return to this small and comfy hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : If you are a couple visting Paris, this is definitely a place to consider booking. Boutique 4 star hotel that will offer a good night's sleep and a nutrious breakfast before you put on our Vibram sole shoes to rack up another 10 km until lunch. Helpful staff that provides useful information.Hotel: Great location on a quiet street with several Metro stops literally just around the corner. Easy access via Metro and busses to all sights and to main train stations like Gare de Lyon or Gare de l'Est. Bakeries, restaurants and mini-marts within walking distance. The Louvre and Notre Dame are a nice 30 min walk away. Rooms: Reasonably priced and reasonably sized by Paris standards. Our Superior Room had the right size for three nights. Clean, quiet and good mattresses. Bonus points for UK and US power outlets above the desk. We missed a coat rack and a second chair, everything else was fine. If you plan to work hard during your stay, you might find the desk a bit small. The hotel is located in an old building, so if you're handicapped this might not be the perfect choice for you.Service: Attentive, helpful and friendly. All staff members we encountered spoke English well but were patient enough to endure my highschool French. Some are more familiar with the vicinity than others, but all tried to come up with answers to our questions.Breakfast buffet: Nice selection that offered enough variety for us on three mornings. High quality products such as yogurt from Normandy, fresh fruits and jambon cru. Also cereals, eggs plus bacon and - of course - croissants. Freshly made pancakes and waffles were kept at room temperature; I prefer them a tad warmer. The hotel's website offered a discount and with 15 €/person you cannot go wrong.\n",

      "  review_body : The Hotel Le Six was perfect for our first visit to Paris! The hotel is well-located down a quiet street, but close to several metro stations and many great restaurants. Our suite was clean and comfortable. The staff was so friendly and helpful. My one regret is that we didn't try the breakfast at the hotel while we were there. Next time! I am already dreaming of our next trip to Paris. Without a doubt we will choose the Hotel Le Six for our stay!The only problem we had is with the exercise room. My daughter runs track for her college, so she tried to use the treadmill, but it didn't seem to work properly. We just adjusted our schedule so that she could run outdoors in the Jardin de Luxembourg instead.\n",

Some bathrooms are not well separated (they have a sliding door) with the remaining room, and this is uncomfortable for couples. The beds have nice matresses and clean bedsheets and blankets. The size of some rooms is too small for the price of 350 euros. The rooms with balcony looking towards the road are the best.The breakfast is one of the best part of the journey in the hotel. Good and healthy quality of products, very good service, and always available to treat you with your preferences and prepapre a hot plate with nice omeletes and scramble eggs.The entrance, for an hotel in Paris, is of a good size and has some nice corners to relax with a tea or a glass of wine.Well located, on a very French cultural Historic centers, sounrounded by the best brasseries of Paris, close to parc de Luxemberg and quartier latin, and at the same time qiet.

      "  review_body : Hotel Le Six is a fun and swanky hotel in St. Germain De Pres. It is newly upgraded, well located and I cannot find much to complain about here! Well, other than the price perhaps. It is definitely in the category of luxury hotel and you will pay for that luxury, but boy was it worth it! I have stayed in some real dumps in Paris for close to this much money and so it was a really nice change to get what you paid for. The hotel is in a nice street nestled between Blvd Raspail and Blvd Montparnasse. There are lots of cafes and bistros, shops and brasseries close by and the hotel recommendations were really excellent. The hotel itself feels modern and nicely designed. I stayed in a deluxe room on the fourth floor looking in on the courtyard. I heard very little noise. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom had a very nice bathtub which I used every night. The windows opened up to let in air. There was no kettle for making tea which was too bad but otherwise, I can only sing the praises of this fantastic hotel. The staff were always friendly and let me check in early. If you have breakfast, you will be overcharged but will eat well. Hotel Le Six, c'etait un hotel extraordinaire. Merci, je reviendrai.\n",

They spoke excellent English and really went out of their way to always greet us or help in any way possible. The room size was acceptable (not large but that was OK), and it was very clean and nicely decorated. This hotel is fairly small, which was nice since it never seemed to be busy. Breakfast was included with our room, and it was very good as well. The location was fantastic. We walked to the Eiffel Tower, a Seine River Cruise, the Louvre, Notre Dame, the catacombs, and restaurants are everywhere, so dining was never difficult to get to. Overall, I definitely recommend this hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : Allow me to preface my review by saying that I am reviewing this hotel as someone who is conscious of the cultural differences between Americans and Parisians. If you expect someone to roll out a red carpet for you and treat you like a pretty princess, maybe you shouldn’t go to Paris... I do believe, however, that the hotel should alert guests to renovations well in advance of their stay. There is no excuse - none - for “overlooking” this activity.... the negative aside...The Aurore Suite is fantastic. Perfectly situated on the highest floor of the hotel, the suite has a view of the Eiffel Tower from the bedroom and a spacious terrace looking over the Esplanade with southern/eastern facing views of Paris. We skipped dining out for every meal and enjoyed picnics on the terrace instead.The location is quite ideal. You’re in a nice neighborhood that isn’t too touristic but you’re still close to the action. The Invalides metro is well connected. Honestly, if you’re up for a little trek, you can access the major sites all by foot. Would I stay here again? Yes. I’m not quite certain I’ll be able to stay in Paris unless I’m in the Aurore Suite. I’ve spent a lot of my life in Paris and it’s not easy to find a space - especially at this price point - quite so spectacular.\n",

      "  review_body : I wanted to add a more balanced review to this page, so here it is.The hotel is lovely. Very pretty, very ‘instagrammable’ if that’s what you’re into. Lovely pastel Parisian interiors and very clean.The staff are very friendly and polite.Breakfast in bed is a must, we were very lazy and had this every day and it was pure joy. Amazing poached eggs.We ate in the hotel restaurant one of the evenings and it was all delicious.Our room (superior) was beautiful and a good size overall however the bathroom was tiny. Travelling as a couple it’s useful to be able to get ready in the bathroom at the same time but you couldn’t comfortably fit two people in here. There was also no full size mirror in the room (only a small one inside the wardrobe) so getting ready was a challenge. The room lacked wardrobe and drawer space so we had to leave little piles of clothes on the chairs, which meant we couldn’t use any of the chairs, so everything just felt a bit more cramped.In the corridors they play music which unfortunately could be heard from within the room. We had to ask for this to be turned off at 12am so we could sleep. Other than this we had a courtyard-facing room which was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable and we had many good nights’ sleep. We used the spa every day before dinner, really well fitted out and very clean. We never struggled to get a cozy place to sit and relax, despite the hotel being full. The jacuzzi was a little cold.Overall whilst the hotel has the facilities of a five star hotel it feels more like a high-standard four star hotel. I think this is reflected in its price so the value is good. I would stay again but I would pick a larger room. Also, the location is perfect - this is a nice classy part of Paris. \n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is the best kept secret in Paris! Nestled in the quiet, historical, and classy 7th Arrondisement, central to many popular attractions. I took at least 15 taxi rides and not one of the drivers had ever heard of this beautiful little Hotel - this is a good thing! I had a deluxe room on the 4th floor. The room was quiet, clean, and more than adequate for 1 or 2 persons. The bathroom was Italian style I was told with a bathtub, and separate stand up shower. Had an issue with the lack of space to put toiletries or anything near the bathroom sink, no big deal though. The room had a safe and minibar as well. This is an absolutely gorgeous property. It is kept immaculately clean and had a staff that was wonderful. Breakfast was included with my room and was ok - nothing special, but nothing bad either. I want to give a HUGE thank you to concierge Julien who helped me for months via email setting up this magnificent trip. Julien went above and beyond in every possible way to help me with anything and everything I needed to make my stay pleasant. I always travel with a portable desk fan so I can be as cool as I need and want to be, so I brought one from the US. I plugged it in, and it blew up immediately due to the current being different LOL. I called Julien and within 10 minutes, had a beautiful Dyson fan in my room! I asked him to purchase a small fan for me to travel with since I was going to another city in France and voila, a new fan was in my room! Also a shout out to concierge Hakim as well for helping me plan my trip, as well as the front desk staff who all went out of their way to make my stay virtually perfect. The hotel has a spa and pool on the \"-1\" floor which was SPECTACULAR! I have never enjoyed an indoor jacuzzi & jacuzzi pool as much as I did this one. The water color was a deep blue with powerful jets installed at the end, the atmosphere was relaxing and serene, making the whole feel of this place ultra luxurious and comfortable. Only one minor criticism I had was my room had a balcony, but it was filled with large plants :( which eliminated the ability to go outside, or leave the door open due to many insects flying around the planters. I think they should remove those plants to allow guests to go outside of their room on the balcony, maybe put a chair or 2 out there as well. Would have loved to have been able to sit and sip coffee or tea outside on the balcony! No matter, I cannot tell you how much I loved this hotel, it is worth every cent they charge to stay there and should I ever return to Paris, this will be my Hotel of choice for sure.\n",

      "  review_body : Beautifully presented boutique hotel strategically located in a central position in the classy 7th district of Paris. It is located close to the Eiffel tower, invalides and the d'orsay museum. Near by high quality dining and not too far from the vibrant champs-élysées. Elegant rooms with high ceilings though mostly lacking any exciting views and having relatively small bathrooms. Very helpful and courteous staff. I used the swimming pool and the spa occasionally and though small, I still found them refreshing. Swimming pools in Paris Hotels are a rare find.\n",

There are multiple train stations near by. Within walking distance are many of the major sites to see in Paris.

I wanted a hotel in a prime location with a romantic vibe and Le Narcisse Blanc sure delivered that. Upon arrival the hotel concierge contacted me and asked if they could set up hotel transportation from the airport, which was a wonderful touch for us to have never have traveled to Paris before. Once we arrived they opened the door, helped with baggage and even gave us a map to where we could walk for lunch. The hotel is very clean and even the standard room we stayed in had beautiful decor. The pool was a great touch to have a drink by after a long day of site seeing. The hotel is right by the river and the walk to Eiffel Tower is about ten minutes. The hotel is right by so many cute small cafes to eat and have a drink at. I was very impressed with the service of the hotel the entire stay and cant wait to go back soon.\n",

While it appears on the internet that this is a Hyatt, as our party was told on several occasions, it is not. Rather, it is a 3-4 star, 37 room, space challenged Hyatt \"partner\" hotel. It would have been much better with only 20 rooms and, therefore, better spatial opportunities. Having been to Paris on many occasions, this will be my last stay at this prooerty.\n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I stayed at Le Narcisse Blanc for one night, while trekking through Europe for a our anniversary. We chose the Aurore Suite, and had the best single night of our journey. Below is a review of our experience:Arrival / Check-in:We arrived in Paris via Eurostar from London, so we took a taxi from Gare du Nord to Le Narcisse Blanc. Easy enough - took about 20 minutes (mostly traffic) and cost about 15 euro. Though we arrived to the hotel relatively early (around Noon), they had our room ready with a bottle of champagne sitting in it. We were given a tour of our room by a very nice concierge and then offered the chance to make local reservations or walking routes. Very pleased to have a room ready so early so we could relax.Service:Paris can have a reputation for being a bit more abrupt, but you won't find that here. Everyone from concierge, to front desk, to housekeeping was nothing but bright and kind. We did not order room service during our stay, but they did drop by several times to deliver chocolates and personal cards welcoming us.Room:This room was the highlight of our trip through Europe. Located on the top (5th) floor, you walk into the room via a small foyer that has its own desk and separate bar / coffee station with a Nespresso machine and mini bar. To the right are big double doors to the King Bed and the bedroom. The bedroom has two sets of large double windows that open up to the Parisian neighborhood and a view of the Eiffel Tower. Of course, the can be covered by floor to ceiling blackout drapes. Down the hallway on the other end of the room is a separate bathroom with rainfall shower and tub that overlooks a glass wall into the City. Of course it can be covered by a large curtain, but the view while looking into the bathroom mirror is amazing. This also opens onto a large personal balcony with its own loungers and table for enjoying the outdoors. Because they offer a noon checkout, we loved the room so much it was hard leaving to explore the city!Property / Location:It is a boutique hotel, so the public quarters are smaller, but there are also very few rooms, so everything felt very personal. The hotel is located on a quiet street in the 7th, that feels mostly upscale residential. The streets out front were not too busy and perfect for walking to St Germain, the Louvre, or Eiffel tower - all within a 15 minute walk. The spa area on the bottom floor is beautiful with a full lap pool, large soaking hot tub, sauna, hamaam, lounge area and changing rooms. We spent a while resting in this area, as it was not crowded and quiet / calming.Overall Impression: Beautiful, safe property. Comfortable, large room with a view. Quiet, relaxing spa. Kind, helpful service. This was our best overall experience in Europe and we would recommend to anyone, and definitely hope to return.\n",

My wife and I stayed in a Deluxe Room, which was good sized, clean and the bedding was very comfortable. It also had a French balcony with a view of the street. The bathroom was also nice sized with a walk in shower. I would stay here again. We were with another couple and it turned out the husband needed a wheelchair to get around the city and the concierge was able to quickly procure a rental wheelchair for him and took care of all the arrangements.

      "  review_body : There are some very good things about this hotel. The location is lovely. It’s about a 20 minute stroll to the The Eiffel Tower and and a 10 minute stroll down to the Seine (where you can pick up the Batobus once crossing the bridge). The reception staff are absolutely lovely. The rooms are opulent if a bit O.T.T but that’s where it ends.I stayed here for a while and stayed in different rooms. The ground floor room has a “private terrace” – umm, not so at all. The terrace is basically the main smoking area for the hotel just “shielded” off with some small dead Christmas trees. I don’t smoke and found that people had thrown their cigarette buts onto the terrace which was disgusting and you can’t open the windows without smoke blowing into your room (the French smoke strong cigarettes). Other than that the furniture is very low (especially for a room that is supposed to be used by people with disabilities). The bathroom is great as there is somewhere to sit in the shower and it has a raised toilet, but if you have problems with your hips and or knees you are going to struggle to in and out of the bed or up or down onto the sofa. The other BIG problem with this room is it’s very noisy. It’s directly above the “spa” – more particularly the hot tub in the spa. This means whenever someone is in there you can hear it like being in a washing machine and hear people talking downstairs. You also have the internet desk for the hotel right behind your head board, so you can often hear people right behind you whilst you’re trying to nap. So definitely not somewhere for a romantic getaway.I had to stay in a top floor suite for a night which was lovely but a long trog to the bathroom and the lift is not for anyone who doesn’t like heights etc. It’s basically a box on a cable rather than a modern lift. The very, very worst thing about this hotel is the room service. I know who should care abut room service but as a woman travelling on my own room service is very important if you don’t want to spend meal after meal being stared at eating in restaurants on your own. I always pick expensive hotels expecting that they will have the room service to match. This is absolutely diabolically bad. The worst I’ve ever experienced. So bad, that despite staying quite a long time I only used it twice. The first time I ordered pene bolognaise and the “cake of the day” (there is a very, very limited choice). What I got was a bowl of what looked like pene that had been boiled from dry (not fresh) and a spoonful of thin tomato type sauce that was pretty vile. If it hadn’t been for the grated Parmesan it would have tasted like cardboard. It was hard to chew and just not at all good. The “cake of the day” was two slices of DRY banana bread. Just dumped on a plate. It looked like the sort of dinner I would send up to a naughty child who’d been sent to their room for misbehaving. It was also crazily expensive. Later in my trip I thought I’d give it another try and ordered a 3 cheese pizza – how could anyone could wrong with that? What I got was basically a microwaved frozen pizza and not even a good one of those. The sort of thing you might nuke for yourself at a motorway service station garage. Really seriously horribly awful. The other thing was the conceirege. I wish I’d taken their names. One was super helpful, respectful, young and humours and made me feel very at home. The other was a bit of a ****. He admonished me for taking my own luggage to reception (a few steps from my door). I don’t think any staff should ever speak to a guest in the way he spoke to me. I was really quite taken aback.There were a lot of older men with what I took to be their younger mistresses and I would imagine it goes down very well with that crowd but if you are looking for a real top unobtrusive home from home this is certainly not it, which is a shame because some people working there are really going out of their way to make it lovely, but are being let down badly by the things that are going seriously wrong.So, I won’t going back. This hotel is a lot of style over substance. It’s a shame because it could be really good. They need to stop believing their own hype. No amount of their own scent in the products and fancy logos all over the place will make up for a lack of basic amenity such as decent food.\n",

      "  review_body : Our first visit to Paris was made memorable by this wonderful hotel and its staff. The room was perfect for the way we travel as the sleeping quarters were separated from the sitting room by a short hallway that kept light and sound from disturbing whoever was sleeping. The bed was extremely comfortable made more so by the soft, fluffy linens. The room had a Nespesso machine so we could enjoy coffee while we lounged away a morning. .The breakfast (included) served in the dining room was a perfect way to start the day and the meal we ate at dinner the first night of our stay was one of the best we had in Paris. The best part of the entire experience was the staff. The concierge team, led by Hakim and ably assisted by Juiien, Clement, Johan, et al., was quite helpful and attentive with many good suggestions on restaurants, attractions, directions and schedule.The hotel is several blocks south of the Seine River and a 10 minute walk from many of the top attractions (Eiffel Tower, Musee D'Orsay, The Louvre, etc.). We couldn't have been happier with the location, the experience and the wonderful people we met!\n",

The concierge team at the hotel was incredibly helpful and attentive and made us feel like VIP guests. With only about a week's notice, they were able to book 2nd row tickets for us to the sold-out ballet at Opera National de Paris, which we would not have been able to secure for ourselves. Nightly turn down service was a treat and the all staff were so delightful and kind. I happen to have a gluten allergy and was thrilled to learn that their breakfast menu offered a collection of quite tasty gluten-free pastries, including chocolate and butter croissants and a farm bread. Although we tried to speak mostly in French, the staff also speaks excellent English. I also happen to quite dislike elevators and was pleased that the 5-story hotel offered both a beautiful spiral staircase as well as a glass elevator that was comfortable for me to ride. The neighborhood was also very convenient, in close proximity to many adorable restaurants and shops on Rue Clare.\n",

The concierge was super helpful with restaurants, and easy to work with over text. Check in staff friendly, the restaurant food was wonderful (I had dinner, lunch and breakfast at least once during my stay) and the ground level room was spacious and perfect, with a charming garden patio where I could sit and have wine and get fresh air. Room noise was low other than some footsteps on the floor above now and then and the bed was very comfortable.The bathroom was large as well, while the room also had a nice large safe and hotel WiFi worked like a charm. I was able to converse with staff either in English or my broken French, all with no problems. I suggest booking through the hotel not through Hyatt as the Hyatt app was giving much higher room rates. Check out was a breeze and no surprises on the bill which is always nice.The area is fantastic with lots of little bakeries, good restaurants, the beautiful views of the Eiffel Tower and lots of hustle and bustle of parents walking their kids to school in the morning. Easy walking to Right Bank as well, just over the bridge and you’re there.I can’t wait to visit again (maybe I can get a discount if I stay a whole month!)Only suggestions.... the Room Service menu didn’t say how to contact room service.. had to look that up another way. Also would be nice to just be able to order the full Cleo menu in Room Service, but was told one can’t. Again, I can’t recommend this hotel enough, really perfect.\n",

      "  review_body : Staying at Le Narcisse Blanc Hotel was one of the best decisions I made when planning our week long trip to Paris this February. The hotel was gorgeous, extremely clean, and in a really nice location. The pictures do not do the room justice. The staff went above and beyond during our stay- they gave us restaurant recommendations, answered all of our questions about touristy things, and they even called and waited on hold for us for 20 minutes when we were having a hard time booking our train tickets for a weekend in Switzerland. We were also given a portable wifi to use for the week, which was a really nice and useful touch. As a hotel snob and an extremely critical/picky hotel guest, I can honestly say that I was sad to leave Le Narcisse Blanc. They truly made our week in Paris amazing. Thank you!!!\n",

      "  review_body : A perfect weekend in Paris....So I booked this weekend away in Paris for my wife’s Birthday. We were greeted by our driver in the airport who then took us to Le Narcisse Blanc. I’d booked through the hotel to which the concierge arranged the S Class Mercedes for us which was extremely relaxing!We were warmly greeted at the hotel and were shown to our room, the Aurore Suite.Not long after we were in the room, there was a knock at the door, we opened it and a member of staff had a bowl with a candle placed in a piece of cheesecake, a lovely surprise for my wife’s birthday. She also received a birthday card, all were very much appreciated and the cheesecake was absolutely delicious.The room was amazing, lovely comfortable bed with a view of the Eiffel Tower. Through the corridor to the bathroom with rainfall shower and large bath overlooking a private terrace overlooking Paris. Rather than booking breakfast we generally like to do our own thing but on this occasion we booked a pastry basket and cappuccinos which were all reasonably priced and delivered to our room. We also used the spa area of the hotel, there is a gym, pool, steam room, sauna and jacuzzi to which we used all apart from the gym! Around the pool are beds which you can just lounge and relax.In summary, we loved the hotel, the spa and in particular the room, it was fantastic and faultless. The hotel itself is situated in a perfect location to restaurants, bars and general sightseeing.We would definitely return to Le Narcisse Blanc in future and would highly recommend this as a must for your visit to Paris but most importantly thanks for making it so special for my wife’s birthday. \n",

      "  review_body : My father stayed here last week for one week and once again had a wonderful stay. Sarah- the manager once again led a team that was as helpful, warm, and caring as on the last visit. I personally asked them to take good care of him and they did. The chief Concierge, Hakim, went above and beyond. He anticipated restaurant and transfer needs and looked out for him in a manner befitting family rather than a concierge. It is without a doubt a good thing to perform one's duties well in any profession, but to carry them out in such an advance manner and with such sincere humanity is a rare thing. Especially at this price point this performance of duty is expected, but rarely found. I cannot imagine one fault that this hotel would have that could not be made up for by Hakim's presence alone. Hakim remembered every single member of our family of 7 who stayed there last June!However, be aware that it is not only because of overall concierge performance that we would continue to recommend Le Narcisse. The amalgam of cleanliness, the class, and the structural modernity of its design- all while capturing what I would call the avant garde tradiitonal Parisian charm- are why we would continue to recommend it. We hope it stays this way forever.\n",

      "  review_body : Business trip to Paris with my husband and we thought we would book a nice hotel in the centre for us to enjoy together. When we arrived the hotel is immaculately clean and the reception staff very friendly - we then get told the lift is out of order - yet they’ve apparently upgraded us to a fifth floor suite - after getting in the service lift which is so small we meet the concierge guy in our room to find it’s actually the room I booked online anyway - no upgrade.We then decide to go for dinner in the restaurant - the food was passable at best and at €8 for a coke very expensive for what we received.The room was nice and very clean so a good nights sleep was welcomed after a busy day.We went for breakfast and after waiting an hour and 15 minutes for pancakes walked out hungry. Incompetent rude staff left to service a busy breakfast sitting - not particularly the 5 star service I was expecting.As we checked out my husband voiced his concerns to the receptionist - who promptly walked away mid through the conversation and began taking to her colleague in French once she realized the bill was paid in full.Terrible service I would not recommend - the only plus for us was the cleanliness.\n",

Nice touch but when your seat is full of crumbs and the wait to get the check in process finalized taking forever it defeats its purpose. The room was just ok, the view of Place de la Madeleine was really nice. The mini bar amenities were cool, but that did not justify the freezing room, ( actually it was even freezing walking towards the elevator), the dirty rug and floor, the terrible quality of the bed sheets that felt like plastic. The staff is basically nice but terribly inexperienced so at this point you can’t really aim to be 5 star. Dinner at the restaurant where again the sitting area was dirty was a let down, only the bread was very good , the rest not so.It took forever and the rude attitude of the Oriental, heavyset waitress with short hair and glasses did not really help. Maybe Fauchon’s idea of adding a hotel might have been a mistake.\n",

      "  review_body : The Fauchon hotel is a good option for people looking for a modern and new hotel. However, it pales in comparison to other 5-star properties.Pros: excellent minibar, excellent breakfast at the Cafe, overall friendly staff, everything is new, good and quiet location in central Paris. Cons: hotel does not have a knowledgeable concierge (in fact, I asked for a tour guide and the concierge contacted an outside service, never followed up and did not arrange anything for me. I was quite surprised by the lack of follow up), absolutely terrible night room service (most items on the already small menu were not available; could not offer coffee and continental breakfast before 7 am); front desk not staffed 24 hours. Bottom line this is an okay hotel but is massively overpriced. Would probably not stay here again. \n",

Loved their shampoo and conditioner by Parisian brand. Pink minibar. Smart toilet with heated seat ;) room service/room cleaning twice a day. BREAKFAST. Few amazing options to choose. We have had Fauchon Breakfast with signature champagne. Make yourself a favor and try their waffles too. The best thing I’ve had in longest time!PRICE. Stayed at another hotel in this area before that is almost the same price range and the level of service and property is not comparable! Fauchon wins on all terms. Amazing value for the money.AREA. High end shopping, cute Parisian streets for walking. Close to Opera and not too far away from Louvre.Would recommend to family and friends.Thank you Fauchon team for an incredible stay! :)\n",

      "  review_body : Very nice hotel in a great location. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome, from the moment of check-in, through every day of your stay, and to check-out. It is a recent addition to the Leading Hotels of the World and definitely belongs.Highlights:- Nice check-in process, with welcome drink and macarons in a cozy reading room.- The complementary Gourmet Bar in the room provides snacks, water, chocolates, refreshed daily. Even a bottle of champagne provided once per stay.- Solid and very fast wifi. Speedtest measured 186 Mbps down / 217 Mbps up.- As a new hotel, all the fixtures and furniture are modern and in good shape.- Very good quality restaurant (Fauchon Grand Cafe). Breakfast is not a typical hotel buffet selection, but table service. The coffee is very good.- Most of all, the staff was very warm and personable throughout.- Easy walk to Concorde, Jardin du Tuileries, Champs Elysees, Opera, Place Vendome. Otherwise the Madeleine metro stop is close by and has three of the metro lines running through it.The one minor miss was breakfast service on one of our mornings in the restaurant, where they failed to provide pastries as part of the French breakfast (it's an important part) as they seemed to have run out and could not make up for it. But as our other seven mornings with them were on point, this was clearly abnormal for them.We would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "  review_body : Location: in Madeleine, Paris. In a central point between popular streets like Haussmann and Saint Honere.Facility: a new boutique hotel, with modern reception area and library . Fauchon cafe is attached to it. There is a fitness center and a spa.Check in: it felt like home, checking in takes place in the library with a delicious welcome drink and fresh macaroons. Megan was so friendly and informative. The manager introduced herself and made sure I don’t need anything. Room: a spacious room with a really comfortable king size bed. The colors are Fauchon colors pink black and some gold. There is a door that leads to the closet area and then to the spacious and neat bathroom. The mini bar in the room is full of delicious Fauchon products and they are all free for the residents of the hotel which was a nice surprise.Conciege: very helpful in recommending good places to eat. One example on their helpfulness that I was looking for change and they didn’t have it at the reception area so Laura saw that and she goes herself to find change for me at the adjacent cafe, which was really nice. House keeping: excellent and they also come to check at the end of the day if everything is alright. Check out: they asked me if I have any suggestions for further improvements which I couldn’t think of anything. Over all: it’s a happy generous hotel; they provided me with an upgrade, extremely friendly staff, and has an excellent location. I will come back again and will recommend it highly\n",

      "  review_body : This is a boutique hotel. That said, there isn’t much “hotel” to the place at all. If you’re looking for wide corridors, a church-like lobby, red carpets and doormen you need to go the The Ritz or George V. Fauchon made the most of the space they had (the Library, the small seating area to one side of the reception desk), but it is far from grand, yet still very Parisian in character. What makes them special:The enthusiasm and genuine attentiveness of the staff. They want you to be happy and make Fauchon warm and welcoming. While the service wasn’t always perfect, it was earnest. Rooms:The room was lovely. Bathrooms well designed with great materials. Good linens. And since the devil is in the details — the light switches are fantastic. A small thing yes, but something I appreciated using repeatedly, day after day. I was also grateful for the Dyson hair dryer. Details matter. Speaking of which, do not underestimate the delight of the Fauchon Gourmet Bar. Stocked with water, and various packages of confection goodness. It was nice to reach for some crackers or truffles without thinking about cost. I never eat/drink from minibars because the cost is obscene. Regardless of affordability — it’s just unconscionable to charge $15 for a package of crisps. With the Fauchon Gourmet Bar, there was total freedom. Let’s talk about soundproofing. I’m sensitive to noise and felt the soundproofing to be excellent. I heard no other guests, either above or adjacent. I was able to hear very faint street noise, but we are not in the countryside and this is to be expected in the middle of a city. I was able to open windows whilst sleeping and awake and was not troubled by noise at all.Location:A 3 minute walk to the Madeleine metro stop, walking to high-end shopping and restaurants — this is a central location for all that Paris has to offer. Design:Modern Parisian. Nothing was too fussy, yet it had personality. Textiles were modern but not cold. Bathroom was minimalistic — but there I appreciate more simplicity. Toto toilets and warm floors — more great design decisions. What they could be doing better:They need a dedicated concierge. While everyone was willing to help me (make suggestions and reservations), no one was particularly knowledgeable. Someone who has in depth knowledge of restaurants, especially of Michelin starred establishments is needed. The service in the library and the restaurant could be improved — it was very sluggish. The breakfast also left something to be desired. While I walked through the narrow corridor to the elevator, someone was vacuuming. I would have expected them to turn off the vacuum when they saw me and wait for me to get on the elevator before resuming. The noise of the vacuum was obtrusive and it disrupted the conversation I was having. Details.More streamlined check in. The library is lovely — but after a 12 hour flight, you want to get to the room and decompress. Also when you do get to the room, you don’t want a lot of talking with the person who took you there. Because fatigue and Paris. Most things are self explanatory. You could offer people a “tour” or offer to come back later. Or better yet, just leave instructions on the iPad for how things work — like the Gourmet Bar, thermostat, turn down service etc.I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again — it was lovely and felt more intimate than some Parisian hotels I’ve stayed at. Although if you’re looking for a more opulent experience with robotically perfect service you may want to seek out a different kind of 5 star hotel.\n",

Or being locked up in a candy store over night?I have and Fauchon turned it into a hotel!And it comes in all shades of prettycandy colours.The same way the French are the masters of turning the most delicious desserts and sweets also into most beautiful ones, the Fauchon hotel has paid attention to making every single detail of its rooms pretty.The welcome at the hotels starts with a welcome drink and macarons. My room (think shades of rose) with a beautiful view of la Madeleine has even more macarons but the best: it had a beautiful Roche Bobois made giant “frigo bar” with loads of Fauchon delicacies (sweet and salty) and Champagne offered by the house.My room was beautiful with large bathroom and next to being pretty it is also super high tech (Speakers, Tablets with Netflix ...) and even the power sockets are extremely beautiful.The breakfast is, of course, divine!And to finish, the staff is great. Very friendly and attentive and they make you feel like home (thanks Tim for the nice talk!).France and the amazing French gastronomy and pâtisserie could not be better translated into a hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : I don't understand all the gr8 reviews and I do regret my stay there: I had an awesome time in Paris, but my choice of hotel was disappointing.Several things really went wrong:1. Upon my arrival I was told I would get a welcome drink (and I didn't ask for anything...): they kept me waiting, and nothing came up (lol)2. I was told I was upgraded, but this was a lie, I only had the deluxe room ,the one I basically booked and paid for3. When I checked in my room, a very talkative lady (and I told her I was tired, after flying 7 hours and spending 5 hours shopping with my friend) showed me around my room and she mentioned that some item were missing (foie gras and some other things): she promised it will be refilled the following day. I am still waiting for it....4. I could hear the cars on the adjacent busy road5. I found a dirty towel placed in my bathroom: it was full of foundation, disgusting6. Water was not provided on a daily basis 9I had to buy my own)7. Gym is so tiny.... 8. I opened a box of cake and it was half empty (another lol)9. Some of the staff were friendly but few could look at you when you were passing by and not even say hiAnyhow, this is not a 5 star hotel. Last year I stayed at Fouquet hotel and it was perfect: next year I will go back to Barriere Fouquet to avoid another bad surprise!!The only good point for this Fauchon hotel is location and the macarons (that I didn t find in my room by the way): but not sure it s worth paying $550 a night just for macarons...I know I am quiet exigent as I am very blessed to be able to live in a great flat and I have also stayed in amazing hotels around the world so my expectation level is really high. And unfortunately Fauchon doesn't make the cut.\n",

      "  review_body : I was in Paris recently and all the places where I normally stay were sold out. I am always slightly apprehensive, especially in heavily touristed cities like Paris, trying out a new property. Paris is notorious for very small rooms and less than stellar front desk service. I am happy to report that Fauchon L'hotel met virtually all of my expectations. It certainly helps that the hotel is brand new. It will be interesting to see if they can maintain the pristine condition that the rooms and public areas are in at the moment. It also helped that I was upgraded to a larger room than I had booked. I believe the category I was in is called a Deluxe Suite. It has a completely separate bedroom with a door between that room and the living room. Btw, the decor might not be to everyone's taste - it's modern with a sort of retro 70's vibe - but I found it very tasteful and fresh. Another plus, the hotel mini bar offers a large selection of complimentary Fauchon items. In my case this included foie gras and a bottle of Fauchon-brand pink champagne. I didn't consume much during my stay but the staff encouraged me to take what I wanted when I checked out. These items made a very nice gift for a friend who lives in Paris.I will definitely stay at this hotel in the future. I imagine prices will increase over time. Right now the property offers very good value especially compared with other high-end hotels in the neighborhood. On that note, this might not be the part of town where everyone would want to stay but it's very safe and filled with all the high-end shopping anyone could want.Lastly, the staff could not have been more pleasant. They all spoke perfect English and found the correct balance of friendliness and professionalism. Overall, this hotel is doing everything right. I travel a lot and have stayed in many top-of-the-line accommodations and I can enthusiastically recommend the property to anyone visiting Paris, either for business or pleasure. I hope they can keep up the high level of service and product currently being provided.\n",

Hotel in nice location with a great jazz club bar and another nice cocktail bar opposite the hotel. A short distance from Opera metro station so easy to get about. Would really recommend. Thank you for a nice time. \n",

      "  review_body : We booked a Superior Double room at this hotel. We arrived before checkin time so had to store our luggage. We had no assistance in moving our luggage from the tiny lobby into the elevator and down to the luggage room at a lower level. (The only reception staff are 2 young ladies who handle the front desk.) After checking in we got the key to the luggage room from the front desk and moved our luggage up to our room. This Superior room was dark and minimal in decor. The bathroom had lots of mold around the tub/shower as well as in the grout between the floor tiles. Dust was layered on pipes along the bathroom floor next to the wall. Lots of chipped paint and stains on the carpet in the bedroom.Room had a tiny closet in a dark corner. The walls were thin and any movement in rooms above or next door were easily heard.The bed was comfortable. The breakfast room was nicely decorated and the breakfast was good. Just wish the hotel would have extended the cleanliness and decor to our room.The location is very good...near Place Vendome and the Opera. We would not stay at this hotel again\n",

I was fortunate to have a triple room which feature a King-size bed and another small day room with a single bed/day bed. The only issue was the room faced the street which has Harry's New York Bar and every night around 2 -3 am their customers would make a lot of noise in the street (including Sunday night) which was disruptive for a good sleep.Breakfast is a typical Continental affair with a nice selection of items and Staff are friendly and helpful.I will stay here again but not in a street-facing room.

There are plenty of options to take the bus from the Opéra Place too.There are several options of restaurants in the same street, with a very good lámen next to the hotel.The weather wasn't very good, but the hotel provided us umbrellas.They have a late check-out option and they kept out luggages after that too.I definitely recommend this hotel for everyone!\n",

Rooms are small on this old builing, and it takes ages for the only elevator to reach your floor, as it's stopped up and down on every floor... Narrow front desk entrance, also. Anyway, the room could have been better, especially the bathroom: maybe it was my room, but that was a really old one, and it felt ice cold! The primitive heating system is useless. Furniture is old and battered, and overall decoration and room atmosphere is way behind expectations. I appreciated the bed and sleep quality, as well as the number of pillows and the new LG TV, that allowed instant USB connection for my portable movies-packed hard drive. By chance, there was a nice breakfast the following morning. Worst = cold. Best = TV + Breakfast.\n",

The hotel itself doesn’t really have any amenities other than a breakfast area, and the rooms are really too small for comfort. I was expecting a small room given the price for a good location in central Paris, however this was smaller than I even imagined.There was almost no room to walk around the bed and the bathroom itself was extremely small.The room was clean and bed reasonably comfortable and I will say that I had a courtyard facing room so that at least ensured that things were quiet at night.The breakfast was very underwhelming with unfriendly staff so would only suggest it if it’s included in your rate.All in all while the location is good and the rooms clean, I wouldn’t really recommend this hotel as there wasn’t much else to note on the positive side.\n",

The staff is wonderful-the room was neat, clean, and quiet since we had a courtyard in the front and the opening between 2 buildings out the bathroom.We arrived at 10AM Paris time-too early to check-in but were offered the use of a bathroom to freshen up after the overnight trip, and our luggage secured. The pretty bathroom was a very nice size with white marble everywhere - was great to have the big window to have a cross breeze with the windows in the BR too. We didn't have breakfast there -just too many places for croissants but the price is great-our relatives stayed at Hotel Westminster, paid more than double for their room and said our room was nicer for a much better price. We would definitely stay at Daunou again! (Beware the VERY slow elevator - the only objection we had).\n",

Hotellet ligger fantastisk, man får virkelig følelsen af at du bor midt i Paris. Metroen ligger kun 3 minutter væk på gåben, så det var selvfølgelig en kæmpe hjælp, når det meste af ferien står på sightseeing. Louvre museet kan man nemt gå til, det samme gælder operaen og Lafayette. Stilen på hotellet var moderne men også hyggelig og ren. Vores værelse lå ud til vejen, men vi blev ikke på noget tidspunkt generet af støj, på trods af at det var fredag-lørdag og der lå en bar lige ved siden af hotellet. Værelset var også rigtig behageligt at være i. Personalet burde nærmest få deres eget afsnit. De var virkelig søde, imødekommende og hjælpsomme. De opbevarede vores bagage da vi kom og da vi tog afsted, da vores fly først gik sent om aftenen. De printede også vores boarding pass da vi skulle afsted, hvilket var virkelig sødt af dem. Vi vil til hver en tid anbefale alle der skal Paris at bo på dette hotel!In english: My girlfriend and i stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of December. It was really a pleasant surprise. The location was fantastic, it felt like you were in the heart of Paris. The metro was only 3 minutes away, which was very convenient when you are spending most of your trip sightseeing. Musée du Louvre was within walking distance, and so was the opera and lafayette. The hotel was modern but also very warm, pleasant and clean. Our room faced the road in front of the hotel, but we were never bothered by any noise, even though it was friday-saturday and there was a bar just beside the hotel. Our room was very nice and comfortable. The staff should almost be a chapter for itself. They were really kind, welcoming and helpful throughout all of our stay. They stored our luggage when we arrived early and when we left, because our plane was departing late at night. They were also kind enough to print our boarding passes. The service they provided was really excellent! We will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who are going to Paris.\n",

It was good value for money and I will certainly stay there again when I nextg return to Paris\n",

      "  review_body : arrival day, we were on a coach 33 in a group. location was on a narrow road, we had to hustle our luggage in a hotel with a non existent lobby, arrived at 11am check in was 3pm, so now try and imagine. we have to leave our luggage, in a room 3 flights down in a holding room, we had to line ourselves on the stairs passing bags to a very small closet. we went out for lunch on a japanese restaurant next door which refused to let us in till 1130 so we were lined up outside on a hot summer day. maybe for parisians they served good food but for us filipinos it was the worst japanese restaurant, taste was awful! i've been to japan, japanese restaurants in manila are more authentic at less than half the price, we were starved and had no choice. back to the hotel our rooms wre ready earlier than check in time which was a sigh of relief. room was very small and understandable, we are in france, cramped but nicely made up, full bar with free coffee, cool AC. decent internet speed. pretty good breakfast although there was only one lady to look after everybody, she was busy as a one legged mn in a butt kicking contest, i pitied her, she did everything on the breakfast buffet, refill, ask room numbers, bus tables, find salt, cook eggs, this hotel should hire an octopus if they intended for one person to look after the breakfast buffet. i was there during the euro 2016 semi finals, if you are staying at a room that is looking out to the street it could be noisy, bars are right beside the hotel.\n",

It only fits 3 person at a time specially when you check in with luggage. But I really loved the rooms. I was expecting a small room for my family but I was surprised when we got our rooms. We had a queen and a single bed which was in a separate partitioned area nearer the bathroom. On our return when we asked for the same set up, we were given the room on the 6th floor. This has a loft bedroom. On entering the room you have a single bed with TV ( It actually has a pull out bed underneath) then you see a narrow flight of steps going to the loft where you have a huge bed and bathroom and tv. Not recommended for very tall people.The morning receptionist was very friendly and helpful. The night receptionist does not know anything. It is very near night entertainment bars. We watched a jazz performer across the small street on our 2nd day and it was great\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed in room 106, a twin room, . I don't expect miracles from a city centre hotel, but there was barely any room to move either side of the beds (which might just as well have been a double bed, they were so close together - I suspect it acts as a double normally) and there wasn't really enough room for us to move around comfortably. Luckily I was with my sister, but I would not recommend it if with a friend or colleague. The bathroom badly needed updating (crack in sink, dirty grouting, toilet roll holder behind the toilet!), but it was a quiet room, and clean. Not really enough towels in the bathroom, and the only English speaking channel on the television was CNN International which is as good as useless. So a couple of improvements would make this a good hotel, particularly considering it's great location. Don't bother with the breakfast at 18 Euros, there are plenty of cafes in the area which are better value for money.\n",

I asked to be picked up at the hotel at 7am. And only got to the airport at abt 830am when it only typically takes abt 30 mins from my hotel to airport! The reason why was the driver went to four more hotels to pick up more passengers! And we only set up to airport 45mins later. By that time, I would have already reached the airport if I had taken the taxi! The driver still had the cheek to drop me off the last! The hotel staff did not highlight this to the me. He should have especially since airport transfer cld mean gate closing and missing the flight if you are not there on time!Lack of transparency. Unreliable. Untrustworthy.

As a family with two children age 11 and 13 we wanted a family room with enough space for us all. In this hotel we got a fantastic 'duplex' room with two single beds downstairs and a huge double upstairs. Plenty of room and plenty of storage. Both areas had a TV. We also had a machine that made very nice coffee. The room was spotless and the bathroom large and equally clean. We even had a partial view of the Eiffel Tower (just the top, but still....). The staff were extremely pleasant and the breakfast good. Best of all was the location. Two minutes away from bus stops with very regular buses, and four minutes from metro station, from where you could also get the RER direct to Disneyland. All in all it was extremely easy to travel to any area in Paris from Opera, and it was an easy walk to the Louvre. The only downside was the sad sight of homeless people sleeping in doorways around Opera, which we saw each night on our way back to the hotel. This was not confined to Opera. Paris seems to have a lot of homeless people. However, the area feels very safe and I would definitely stay here in this hotel again. I highly recommend it for families.\n",

While in a traditional neighborhood building, the hotel has been fully modernized inside and is very well appointed. Our stay there for a mixture of business and sightseeing was very comfortable thanks to the good-sized room, comfortable bed, modern shower, etc. The breakfast is a typical continental breakfast buffet and is nice (although the bread rolls were much too hard one of the mornings). A stand out comment to make also is that the staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly - speaking English very well and patient with our less than adequate French.\n",

They leave Nespresso pods and machine in the room which was super nice touch and well appreciated on our end. Save on morning coffee The room itself was small, but believe that’s standard for Paris. I highly recommend this place to stay if you’re in Paris\n",

      "  review_body : The room was clean and cozy. They offered a coffee when we arrived, umbrella's when it rained, answered our questions that we asked and made suggestions on close restaurants and how to get around the city. It is a few steps to the Metro and with that we traveled all over Paris. There is also a park a few steps away, down some stairs. It was not in the busy section Paris so it was fairly quiet. When our flight was cancelled an hour before our taxi arrived, Franceska called and cancelled the taxi and contacted the airport, so Peter could inquire about our flight. Since they were booked full that night, she called additional hotels and found us new accommodations for that night My husband was stressed and she walked him through the mess we were in. We left with a smile and so very grateful for the patience and smile she showed throughout the ordeal. She was amazing and will not be forgotten. Our next trip to Paris will definately be to this Hotel.\n",

Our room was very clean and comfortable and very much as advertised. This is a compact, traditional townhouse hotel though our room/en suite was spacious and very well appointed. Despite this hotel’s modest 3 star rating it offers luxury in the details and presents as a stylish and well maintained boutique hotel.Combined with it’s proximity to the Eurostar terminal and it’s position in a ‘foodie’ neighbourhood, Hôtel Helussi would be a tough option to beat for a hotel in it’s class.Just one more thing, the staff at the Helussi were keen to attend to a minor special request asked by us at the time of booking. We were both impressed and touched by the effort made to make our brief stay very special. Thank you.\n",

We had a lovely room on the 4th floor. Spacious, comfortable bed and easy to use AC (it was HOT in Paris). The shower was excellent. Breakfast is included if you book direct. It was a normal continental breakfast and was nice. The staff were all very friendly (including the cleaning staff). WiFi was fast, and the soap/shower gel smelled lovely. The area was quiet and a 10 min walk from Gare du Nord, and 2 mins from Poissonnière. There was a lovely boulangerie/pâtisserie on Rue du Faubourg Poissonnière as well as a small supermarket. There were also a lot of interesting looking restaurants on that road. We would happily stay there again on a future visit to Paris. \n",

No issues with it at all Staff friendly & helpful. Quiet room even though we faced the street. We booked breakfast which was typical fare, basics of bread, meat, eggs, cheese, cereals & fruit. Good enough to set you up for the day. We liked the decent breakfast times & late checkout. Didn’t feel we had to rush at all. Would recommend. \n",

Our room was very large and a Superior room. Bathroom was upgraded and we had an iron, ironing board and hair dryer. Even better.... black out shades to help with street noise ( there wasn’t any) and jet lag. Front desk was helpful and nice. Perhaps the tub may be a little high for you. But my 82 year old mother had no problems. We didn’t eat breakfast. If you need a spa, workout room and room service, perhaps this isn’t your hotel. But seriously.... you are going to Paris to work out? You will get plenty of exercise walking. The view of the Eiffel Tower from this room was stunning and it’s less than a 10 minute walk. The Rue Clerc is maybe 200 feet away. Comfortable and charming. I will definitely stay agsin!!!\n",

We wanted to stay in the city center since we were planning to do all the tourist stuff during our short time in Paris. We searched and read reviews for a ton of hotels and settled on this one. We could not be happier with our choice. The folks at the front desk were warm and helpful, especially Christian, who offered plates, forks, etc. when we came back late one of the nights with some bread, cheese, and wine for dinner. Christian also offered help with the Metro and other stuff. I believe we reserved the superior room but I don't remember off-hand. We were delighted that we had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our bed, a free upgrade! Room size was bigger than comparable hotels we've stayed at within the EU. The king bed was super comfy and overall the hotel was quiet and clean. They had breakfast for a fee in the morning but we didn't try it. The free snacks during the day were a nice touch. Highly recommend this hotel.\n",

Overal this room was not suitable for us and we had to relocate. There may be better rooms in the hotel but this is what we ended up with.

It was a quiet refuge and place to recover from our grueling Rick Steve's GAS tour and the rooms were comfortable, the beds soft and the service WONDERFUL. Specifically. Christian who manned to front desk, was always helpful and provided much guidance to all the people staying there, including us! He was happy to give us napkins and plates for our in room picnics of the delectable pastries and breads, cheeses and meats we found on our sightseeing. He was also vigilant and retrieved some lost papers we accidentally left on a couch in the lobby. I can see why Rick Steves customers oftem stated they have stayed at this sweet hotel, year after year! It is a gem!\n",

The Superior room we had at first was very nice with a nice shower. The last room we had had not been rennovated and was very tired. The shower set up flooded the bathroom and the room smelled so strongly of air freshener that it gave me a headache. There is a very big variation in rooms- I only would recommend this hotel if you reserve the Superior class room.\n",

We were lucky to stay in a room with a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower (at no extra cost) which is less than a 5 minute walk away. The nearest metro station is just round the corner which is ideal for travelling across the city! The overall location of the hotel is fantastic, in a lovely area of Paris which is a lot quieter than many other areas in the centre of the city but there is still an abundance of lovely bars, cafes and restaurants in close proximity to the hotel. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and comfortable and had all the comforts needed for a short stay. Hotel was overall excellent value for money in a city were hotels are often very expensive but substandard. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying here again when I return to Paris!!\n",

Did just that few times.I was communicated few days after initial reservation and politely asked for any enquiries for my stay. Asked for a sunny room at a higher floor and got a lovely room at a 5th floor.On a weekend one should expect a lot of commotion around hotel with people walking around and sitting in many nearby restaurants and bars.

      "  review_body : We spent a weekend at the Hotel Joke in October 2019. Overall, although our stay was comfortable, and despite the positive ratings found on Trip Advisor we would not recommend staying here. I have stayed in hotels around the world, and we visit Paris regularly. We would not stay here again.We had a standard double room facing the main street, Rue Blanche. Room was a fair size for a standard double, bed was comfortable, pillows supportive, bathroom modern, bath and shower worked great, all was very clean. Nice features included water cooker for coffee or tea, free drinks found in small refrigerator, and in-room safe for valuables. We found the room to be quiet only if the windows to the street remained closed. Perhaps a room facing an inner courtyard would have allowed opening the windows.Check-in and out was efficient; however we were certainly not greeted with a smile or truly made to feel welcome. Sophye, whom we encountered on our last day, was very professional, and polite. The others not so much. The breakfast was really good, with lots of choices including prepared and boiled eggs, potatoes, pastries, fruit and musli. Hotel appeared to be very clean, and security with 24/7 coverage and locking front door was comforting. The free afternoon snacks and beverages offered by the Astotel chain is a nice touch. TWhile just down the street from the Metro Blanche, the Moulin Rouge area, and the base of Montmartre, the Hotel is located on what could easily be described as, well let’s say not the most picturesque street in Paris. Enough said. This may be perfectly fine for many people, but there are certainly better options when it comes to neighborhoods and settings. Many guests would not feel safe on this street. If you like this area, you could consider the Astotel Hotel Astoria just down the way on Rue Moscou – recommended.Our initial reception and check-in left us with a bad impression, which was hard to shake. We arrived at the front door and were greeted by a young man, clearly a staff member, who was “hanging out” at the main entrance with his back and foot up against the wall having a cigarette. Probably not the most professional behaviour for a staff member. Upon entry we were greeted by an overwhelming disgusting smell of greasy, fried bacon and eggs from the breakfast area. This is because the breakfast area is located directly at the check-in desk. We then observed a young man who was obviously a friend of the young guys on duty lounging in the breakfast area surfing his iPhone. Clearly not a paying guest, and not a good representation for the Hotel. The next morning the young man at the front reception desk and his colleague were having breakfast, from the guest breakfast bar while on duty. So instead of working they were having their breakfast behind the reception desk from the selection for the paying guests. Interesting to say the least.The Hotel essentially has no lobby. You enter the Hotel directly into what is the breakfast area, with tables and chair for breakfast and afternoon breaks. There is no real separation, so you are checking in and out directly where guests are getting their breakfast and taking their meals. The room was very stuffy, which has been noted by other guests in their reviews. This is because you really cannot open the windows because of the very loud noise coming from the main street, and the air conditioning is turned off outside of the summer months. It was so hot and stuff at night that you really could not get a comfortable night’s sleep. We had asked for a quiet room in our reservation request, and perhaps we should have asked for a room looking out onto the inner courtyard had we known those were available. Maybe they would have allowed you to open your windows and get some fresh air into the room.Overall, although we came to accept the good things of the Hotel Joke for what they are, we would not recommend staying here.\n",

      "  review_body : As many have reported, great property in a good location. Rooms are smallish in keeping with the hotels of Europe. Appreciated the snacks and beverages that are always available. Breakfast was plentiful and had some hot options like eggs and mini-crepes. Only downside was rooms are a little stuffy this time of year. Have to keep the windows closed due to street noise and the AC is officially off for the season. Rooms ARE quiet, by the way. The fan helps some but still a little warm under their nice comforter at night. I’m sure if I had asked for relief, I would have gotten it. Staff was ALWAYS helpful. The Blanche metro stop is a 3 minute walk. Used it to get from CDG to get to the property on arrival. The Pigalle neighborhood, a couple blocks away offers a ton of tasty dining options. Last nights’ dinner at Gugero was terrific at reasonable price (for Paris). It’s about a 40-minute and enjoyable walk down to the Seine and city center. Galleries Lafayette dept store about 15 minutes walk. Sacré-Coeur and Montmartre are right up the hill with lots of great shopping along the way. Bring some good walking shoes and soak it in.

      "  review_body : We stayed for 6 nights at the Hotel Joke and had an incredible experience. We were astonished by the quality of accommodation, the plentiful and delicious daily breakfast, and amazing staff. They take pride in their property and in their hospitality and it shows. We did not want to leave! We stayed in one of the smaller rooms on the fourth floor with a view of the courtyard and it was the quintessential Paris experience. There is joy everywhere in this hotel- in its staff, in its facility, and in the incredible vacation experience we enjoyed. Merci beaucoup, Hotel Joke. We love you and hope to come back soon.\n",

      "  review_body : There are thousands of hotels in Paris and we were very lucky that we chose this one.Everything was spot on. The staff was so friendly and welcoming. Nice clean room with comfy bed and pillows. Really good air conditioner - outside was 42,6°C/108.7°F (new Paris heat record) but room was nicely cool. Room was soundproof so we didn't hear anything from the street. Good selection of items at breakfast, snacks/cakes and fruit and tea/coffee from 2.00pm to 2.00am and non alcoholic beverages in the minibar which were refilled each day.Hotel location is perfect to explore different parts of Paris. Montmartre and Opera in walking distance, Molin Rouge was visible from the room window and to Blanche, Pigalle and Place de Clichy metro stations few minutes to walk.Merci beaucoup to all the staff and hope to see you soon. Paris and hotel Joke are wonderful.\n",

      "  review_body : This would have been a 5 star review however, we had some prior communication with the hotel and understood that we would be paying our outstanding balance on arrival. In fact, two separate payments were taken from our bank account unexpectedly a couple of days before we were due to arrive. This lead to some confusion and would not have been a problem had we not been told the balance was due on arrival.Once we arrived at Hotel Joke, we were very impressed. The staff could not have been more helpful and courteous. Lovely, bright reception area, quirky, spotless bedrooms, with a location perfectly suited to explore Paris. The rooms were a perfect size and well designed. The beds were very comfortable and we were in Paris during the heatwave so the air conditioning was perfect for cooling down. The breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice. There is a mini fridge in the rooms that get stocked everyday with soft drinks. At reception, there is also complimentary soft drinks and beverages along with pastries, crisps and fruit. Metro station is at the top of the street and the area feels very safe and friendly.We wholeheartedly recommend Hotel Joke and cannot wait for our return. Merci beaucoup et au revoir Hotel Joke!\n",

We were also in Paris during the week of record high temperatures and the air conditioning couldn’t have been more appreciated! We also booked a 3 person room which wasn’t available, but the manager gave us a second room to better accommodate us even though we we didn’t use it- very thoughtful. Highly recommend going and the only place I’ll stay again in Paris. \n",

      "  review_body : Haaaakay, so, took my daughters (two adult, one teenager) to Paris. This place was the BOMB.First, rooms are small, like most boutique hotels in Europe. I set my girls up in one room, me in another. My room was as standard queen, but smaller than my master bedroom at home. Fine for one person, but it would be hell for two, especially if you got into that disagreement about one of you looking too hard at someone else or something else (insert appropriate gender, organism, species). And believe me, there's plenty to look at. However, the rooms are nicely appointed, have a non-alcohol mini bar that's refreshed everyday, and my room had bitchin' French doors/windows looking down to the street below. Keep them open, you'll hear every sound. Keep them closed, you'll hear nothing. They do have larger rooms, like the one I got for my daughters, so keep that in mind. Staff super friendly, all speak English.I had my reservations booked with breakfast included. Recommended. Usual bill of fare was eggs, unidentifiable, but tasty, sausage, crepes, sautéed vegetables, tons of fresh fruit and assorted breads and cheese. Ask for 'home made coffee', some of the best in the city, free of charge. Overall, this hotel hotel, staff and location are excellent for the money. And make sure you hit Rouge Bis, a restaurant, close by. Excellent food and great staff, totally affordable. Nice place to stop for dinner or that last cocktail before heading back to the hotel. \n",

      "  review_body : We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at the Hotel Joke - Astotel. The staff is friendly and helpful Our room was small but clean with a creative and modern look. Breakfasts were excellent with a wide variety of choices including eggs, sausage, a variety of cheeses, breads, vegetables, fresh and preserved fruits and pastries. Snacks are available all day. An unusual feature is that there is actually a \"Joke\" channel in the room television which provides \"candid camera\" type videos that are done without dialogue so people with any native language can appreciate them. They were actually quite funny. The hotel is conveniently located near the Metro so even though it is not near the central Paris museums and monuments, they are easily accessible. I highly recommend this hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed in Hotel Joke for three nights while visiting Paris. This is a very affordable hotel by Paris standards, and it's great value! I would definitely use this hotel again, or try another in the Astotel chain. The location is great - a stone's throw from the Moulin Rouge and Blanche metro station, so well connected for Gare du Nord and all tourist destinations. The hotel feels completely secure and safe. My room was small, but comfortable and had all the essentials. The unlimited soft drinks and snacks available downstairs all day, plus free soft drinks in the room, is brilliant. The breakfast was quite good - decent selection of hot and cold items, I was happy considering it's a small, budget hotel. Perhaps best of all was the excellent service on the desk - the staff were very happy to speak English to me, they were warm and welcoming at all times, and gave me great local restaurant recommendations. The only thing I could fault was that the walls are a bit thin so I could hear other people banging about, and a baby crying, a few times, but it wasn't late at night and didn't really bother me. For an affordable stay, this hotel is brilliant, and I would highly recommend.\n",

      "  review_body : Period of Stay from 8th June to 11th JuneWhen we arrived at Hotel Joke, our trip had been nothing short of a disaster. We had landed at CDG Airport at 7+am n had decided to take the trains to Hotel Joke. I was pickpocketed along the way and by the time I had arrived at Hotel Joke, my cards had been used to purchase 13K+ Euros worth of items!The 2 staff manning the reception helped us with advise on where the nearest police station was and assisted us in getting checked-in into our room slightly earlier so that we could make our way to the station to file a report.Other than that horrible start to arriving at Hotel Joke, the rest of our stay there was excellent! We had been apprehensive, at first, considering that we had not heard of the hotel chain and the price was reasonable compared to the other hotels we had searched.These were the aspects that stood-out for me:1. Room and toilet were extremely clean and daily housekeeping mantained the cleaniness.2. The bed and pillows were comfortable and we had restful sleep.3. In-room mini bar provides water and a few drinks and these are replenished, daily. Towels and soaps are replaced / topped up daily.4. Pastries, breads, chips and drinks are provided at the lobby, throughout the day! So, you could actually have light meals, anytime you want. All this at no extra-charge.5. Hotel Joke is located less than 2 minutes, walking time, from Blanche Metro Station. The Moulin Rouge is just across the street from the station so 2 minutes walk to that, too. You are also a 2-3 walk away from eateries and pharmacies.To top this all off was the EXCEPTIONAL service and care provided by Ms. Oxana. She was one of those who attended to us when we checked in and she helped us with directions to the police station and getting a room earlier. On subsequent days, she answered all our queries and provided advise on our daily plans. Why she stood out was because she was genuinely warm and always ready to help. Thank you, Oxana!The only downside of Hotel Joke, in our opinion, could be the part of Paris it is located in. It is around 20 minutes away from the central part of Paris, where all the main attractions are. That could explain the cheaper rate for the hotel. And the main street leading to the hotel doesn't feel safe. There are throngs of adult shops and adult cinemas along the main street so walking along the streets, especially in the evenings, nights or early mornings can be a nervy experience. The Metro Stations, along the Blanche Station stretch, also do not feel safe. I guess, as a local, you would know how to safe-guard yourself but, for a foreigner, it would be a concern.All-in-all, Hotel Joke is a really good hotel and is great value for money. If you are planning to leave or return to the hotel, at night or, if you are lugging luggage, it may be better to spend a bit extra and take a taxi. There is a taxi stand next to Blanche Station so a taxi would be available just a minute away.\n",

The lobby was clean, staff friendly, there was snacks set out all day long, breakfast was nice (even hot scrambled eggs). THe coffee was one drawback - not so great. It was from a machine that used pods (like nespresso - just not as good) - but i will live with it, Our rooms were quaint and clean. There was a neat theme - stuffed animals everywhere in glass boxes. Good wifi - in the rooms and lobby. We sat up in the lobby every night and had wine and snacks and recapped our days. The location is good - you can see Moulin Rouge from the hotel entrance, and the metros are just up the street 5 minutes walk. There are is also a starbucks and good restaurant by the metro stop. We were able to get around easily - even walk to the montmartre cemetery. This is an \"interesting\" part of town so don't mind the window shopping for sex items.\n",

We arrived at the hotel late at night and tired from a full day of traveling. The warm welcome from the manager who was training someone that night was a great way to start our stay. Every day following staff were super pleasant and helpful. We loved the location in Montmartre, the walk to Sacré-Coeur takes you through so many charming corners. And if walking is not your thing, a metro station is minutes away. There's definitely a lot of sex-oriented businesses on the main drag of the Moulin Rouge but it is easy to just ignore it. Like many rooms in Paris, it was quite small but it was functional and had nice touches like usb chargers and a free minibar. The included breakfast was quite satisfying and we also often took advantage of the free snacks later in the day. If I return to Paris, this hotel will be my first choice. \n",

We enjoyed the free drinks in the minibar in the room. I loved the Eifel tower design on the carpet. The bathroom was also very clean with shelf space for our toiletries. We LOVED the shower --it was powerful and very easy to adjust the temperature. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning. I loved the cheese variety and the charcuterie. THere was a nice variety of breakfast items and the busy staff worked to replenish items, reset tables and attend to any needs of guests. We often came back to the hotel after dinner and enjoyed a dessert from the afternoon-late night snack/treats area. We also took advantage of the reciprocal privileges at the other Astotel hotels. We carried our little map with us and if we were tired, in need of a bathroom or a drink, we would stop in to one of the other hotels and sit down for a rest, a drink, etc. I am hoping Astotel will open some new hotels in other areas of the city as it really was nice to be able to stop in, even just to sit down for a bit of a rest and a coffee. We really enjoyed our stay. As others have mentioned, the hotel is just a couple of minutes' walk from the Blanche metro station. We also walked about 5 minutes to both the Pigalle metro station or the Clichy metro station (each about a 5 minute walk) if we were taking another line (of course we could transfer from either to Blanche but often opted just to walk above ground to either station). Although I don't have any complaints, I wish the lobby were a bit more spacious. The breakfast tables are placed together tightly which I understand as there must be enough to accommodate all of the guests but sometimes it was a bit tough to get in to the backside of the tables without other guests having to get up to let you by. Ideally, there would be a larger lounge area in the lobby but again, I understand that it is limited by size.\n",

      "  review_body : Great little hotel in Montmartre, which is a bustling area with a huge amount of restaurants and bars around. If you don’t mind the sex shops lighting up the Main Street by night and want to get a glimpse of the Moulin-Rouge. The hotel itself has loads of character and the staff were so helpful, both before and after our trip. Madam Coq the manager deserves a special mention because she allowed us to change the date of our booking due to our daughter being sick. She also arranged to send some items we left in the room to our home address. Very kind. The room was small but cleverly designed and being high up, our balcony looked right down on the busy street below. Lots of people watching from up there. Spotlessly clean and the free cold drinks were a nice touch. The only point to make was the room remained overly warm despite us turning the heating off. In November this was no problem if you just open up the balcony for a few minutes. The breakfast was a great spread. I would highly recommend this hotel. Very close to the metro station ‘Blanche’ too so don’t worry about being away from the city centre. Make sure you take the hike up to Sacre Couer to see the best view of the city! \n",

The staff are top notch, friendly, professional, helpful, efficient, seeming to do everything possible to make our trip so smoothly. We arrived on a demonstration and strike day and the staff member checking us in gave us the right information so our day was not at all impacted by these events. This same staff person (I'm sorry I did not get his name) had a little chat with the teenagers in our party, about the neighbourhood; incredibly helpful. Another staff member gave us Metro details for one of our journeys, as if by magic. No effort was too big or small for this team.Then came the room. Our room was comfortable, warm, super clean, had everything we needed, and was oh-so quiet. I couldn't believe how quiet the room was, given the fantastic location and how close we were to so many things.But the hotel offers so much more. We made the most of the seemingly-endless supply of refreshments and delicious things to eat in the lobby. There are tables in the lobby area too, very welcoming, so we were able to relax and refresh with our friends. The entire hotel is full of fun decor and comfortable spaces. The design is inviting and welcoming all over the building.I can't wait to stay at this Hotel Joke again and to see their other locations in Paris.\n",

There are plenty of bars and restaurants in the surrounding area.The hotel and room were pretty funky, with black & white check wallpaper and carpet and a mirror on the ceiling in the bedroom! There was enough storage in our room for a few nights and there was a wee balcony as well. The room and bathroom were very clean and sheets, towels and minibar changed daily. Breakfast was included in our booking and there was a good selection every morning of meats, pastries, breads, cereals, yoghurts and hot food. Pastries, cakes and soft drinks were also available from 2pm onwards each day. The staff were very friendly, always saying bonjour or bonsoir to us. The 24 hour reception is always a bonus.The only negative was that our room was very warm and the only way we could cool it down was to keep the balcony door open - the aircon doesn't work in the winter months.

Incredible burger joint across the street (Mamie Burger). The rooms were quiet and spotless clean. Same with the hotel. My only complaint, and while small, still played a major role in our trip, was the poor internet. We were in room 110. Right above the check in. Not sure how WiFi couldn’t even accidentally find its way into our room but it did not. It was sad not being able to share our two week vacation each night without venturing downstairs to find reliable service. It is 2019 and this really should be fixed. Other than that, this was just about as perfect a stay as you can get in Paris. Just be prepared to have issues with internet service, if this is important to you. \n",

This was my SECOND stay at 34B-Astotel because this is how good it is. (thinking about a third already) The location is ideal if not perfect. Very close to all tourist attractions by foot and Metro, the neighbourhood if filled with restaurants for all budgets, cafes, creperies, bars and so on ( I personally recommend The frog & Underground for the best beer and tasty food).The hotel is spotless clean, the rooms are impeccable (one of the few times I saw the cleaning staff actually vacuuming the rooms), with perfectly working heating/air-conditioning.Beds comfortable, free mini bar and most importantly QUIET. It is really hard to find a quiet place in Paris for good rest. First time at this hotel I stayed in the interior court which was extremely quiet but this time I had a street facing room. At first I was scarred of the noise because the streets are very loud and crowded but the hotel is SOUNDPROOF so don't worry if you also get the street rooms.Breakfast is good, not the best I had but decent. Everything is fresh and almost for all tastes. Coffee is horrible, could never drink it, but there are a lot of coffee shops and decent prices nearby. Open bar amazing, found some of the nicest treats there (donuts, muffins etc).Gave 5 stars for the price-quality report, hotel is actually between 3-4 stars.\n",

      "  review_body : We had arrived into Paris on an early flight so on arrival at the hotel our room wasn’t ready which was fair enough and my sister was staying in nearby Les Halles anyway so we went to her hotel instead. We returned after 2pm as advised only for the room not to be ready still. Our friends had arrived in the meantime and checked into their room. Ours was eventually ready by about 4pm. My only criticism. It was worth the wait however! An amazing room over 2 floors with a patio and a spiral staircase! Lovely hotel with plenty of natural light and quirky design touches (tricolore facade, toy car and rocking horses in reception, mini red Eiffel towers on display outside). Sumptuous breakfast awaited every morning. The icing on the cake was the soft drinks and snacks available daily in the lobby and the minibar which made the room rate very attractive (for Paris).Everywhere was spotless and staff were friendly enough. Nice neighbourhood with good local eats notably Archibon. We would stay again or at another Astotel without hesitation.\n",

Breakfast was ample and there was no rush to get to the food and there was a chill out area for guests. Fridge contents were free and topped up daily and extra drinks and pastries and biscuits from 2pm-1am were a bonus. We had a room on the 2nd floor looking into the courtyard area which was nice and quiet and the beds were comfortable. Once you have got your bearings, the metro station is around the corner and there are several in walking distances. You can easily catch the 85 bus to Sacre Couer which only takes 20 mins. You can also use your 1 day metro card on the buses as well. all in all an great stay in Paris for long weekend break!\n",

      "  review_body : This was our third or fourth stay at 34B. Obviously, we enjoy the property. What we especially enjoy is the VERY strong air conditioning and when it's summer in Paris, I won't consider staying anywhere else, not even another Astotel. Sure enough, we had the bad luck to have weather in the mid 90s during our stay, but we were always able to come back to an incredibly cool room (literally, and also figuratively). The staff is excellent, super helpful and friendly. We got a superior room, which was very spacious. We loved breakfast, the free mini bar and the free afternoon snack area. We really enjoy the neighborhood, which is very convenient. If I had to find things to complain about: The wifi was not working sometimes, and sometimes it was super slow. There's not much space to hang things, and only five hangers, so that's one small drawback. I've never seen more than five hangers in a room. And also, on this trip, some of the pillows were weird, like someone had chopped up foam and thrown it in a sack. But two of the pillows were perfectly normal. Still, for the price, this is an amazing hotel.\n",

We booked a standard room which was comfortable and clean. The bed was big and comfy with lots of fluffy pillows.

      "  review_body : There are too many choices when picking a hotel in Paris, but between Trip Advisor's reviews and Astotel's website, it was easy to choose this hotel. We booked directly from the Hotel 34B website, which gave us the lowest rate and also free breakfast. The communication from the start with the e-mails was wonderful. I explained that we were staying in Paris to celebrate our anniversary and anything they could do to make it special would be wonderful. The hotel decor is great and the location is close to two metro stops which can get you every where. The breakfast was also wonderful with many choices. The other pluses are the free drinks in the room's refrigerator that are refilled daily and the snacks and drinks in the eating area that are available from 2 pm until very late. I also loved the seating area where you could relax and stretch out whenever you wanted. We stayed in a superior king and the room was wonderful as well as the bathroom. I loved the shower, and the little details like the magnifying mirror were great! When in France you should always try to speak some French, but if you are uncomfortable doing so, the staff speak English. All of the above would be more than enough to have me return to this hotel, but the icing on the cake was that we were treated to champagne and chocolates on our anniversary. It was such a wonderful surprise and made our day very special. Thank you Hotel 34B for the wonderful 10 days that we spent there and we're hoping to return! Merci!!!\n",

There was a little corridor with one room housing 2 twin beds, and another one leading to a bigger single king-sized bed. Switches were well-placed. The included mini-bar was just a welcomed reprieve (no alcohol). Toiletries were stocked well and of good quality. The bathrooms were super clean. The beds were awesomely comfy. Included breakfast was varied, well-stocked and had a lot of choices. The open bar (without alcohol) was nice but I never really got to utilize it; you can go to any of their associated hotels and also use THEIR other bars. It was closed to everything north of the Seine and 3 minutes from a metro stop. What more can you ask for?\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed in the Prestige Room for 4 nights in Dec 2019. Arrived from US early in the morning, first we were given a \"Prestige room\" on the 3rd floor, thank goodness I read the reviews ahead of time because the bathroom just had a shower at the same level as the floor, which caused the water to spill all over the bathroom floor, there was no closet or storage area, no couch or sitting area. I asked to be moved to another room with a tub. We were moved to room 109 which was very nice with a closet and better bathroom. The breakfast was ok, but not too much variety for the 3 days we were there. It would be nice to have fresh omelettes or made to order items. The beds were comfortable but the pillows were not very good quality. The location of the hotel was great, the mini-bar was nice to have and the staff was very friendly.\n",

      "  review_body : Hôtel Malte Astotel is a place where to get friendly and thoughtful service with quality. The staffs are all welcoming and gentle who will not only share advice for your trip and communicate with you as a friend. The decorations and the spotless clean environment is out of the question. We enjoyed every corner of the place and wished we could stay longer. Another surprising and thoughtful service is the afternoon tea open bar. From 2pm to 2am everyday, you enjoy drinks and snacks for free. This open bar is provided with all their 14 partner hotels!!I highly recommend this place for visitors wanted to explore París as well. You can walk to all the main attractions such as the Louvre museum in mins. It would be wonderful to come back and stay here for another great experience. \n",

We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and we enjoyed it very much. The room was extremely clean, the hotel lobby had a lovely atmosphere and the breakfast buffet offered a nice variety of foods (eggs, bread, cheese, cold meats, smoked salmon, cereals and a few hot options too). I also liked the fact that breakfast wws served until 11 am during the weekend. We booked the standard room and, although not very big, we found it very comfortable. The hotel provides free snacks, hot and soft drinks from 2 pm to 2 am (at any of the hotels from the same chain), which we found it very handy. We would definitely come back!\n",

Walking distance to many sights and 3 different train lines.- The breakfast in the morning was fantastic. Coffee, tea, juice, pastries, eggs, bacon, charcuterie, cheese, etc. It was really nice to just come downstairs and have a quick meal before starting your day.- At 2PM they offer snacks and more importantly they allow you to stop in at any of their hotels around Paris to use the restroom and have a coffee and pastries.- Located right near 'Japantown' of Paris, there were a lot of sushi and ramen restaurants if you want to take a break from French food.- They stock a small mini fridge for you daily.Bad- Rooms are small but that is to be expected in Paris.- I found it a little strange that the chair provided for the small desk was wire frame, not very comfortable and seemed to belong outside in a patio rather than inside a hotel room.- I think the walls or floors were a little thin. We could hear our neighbors having a phone conversation.- 'Closet' space was very limited for 2 people to hang any clothes.\n",

The promise of free drinks is fine but our fridge not restocked. We also did not get restocked on coffee. Breakfast buffet is okay. The free snacks in the afternoon and evening are a nice addition.

      "  review_body : It is our last night in Paris. We have been here five nights so far and it has been unforgettable. The hotel is in a great location that is walking distance to the Louvre.Metro stations were nearby and easy to access. On our way in from CDG, we took the RER B to Chatelet Les Halle's and found it super easy to get to the hotel.We thought the hotel was in a great location for walking to all the attractions.I'm not sure what the average walking distance is for people on vacation but for reference we did about 30,000 steps per day on my wife's Apple watch. We pretty much walked everywhere except to Versailles. Walked to Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coeur, and Notre Dame. I think if the spot was within a 2 mile radius of the hotel, we walked and explored.Gemma was fantastic at the front desk. She had some macarons set in our room for my birthday which was a nice touch. Staff during breakfast were nice and helpful. Thank you!The included breakfast is nice to have but I felt the included minibar and snacks/drinks was great for hydrating and filling out water bottles. Most Astotels are north of the Seine and I wouldn't go out of my way to walk to one for a drink/snack. But while out and exploring, we did stop into any ones that we were near to use the restroom or get water.I would come back again! Thank you Hotel Malte staff.\n",

      "  review_body : I have spent many nights in mid-range Paris hotel rooms over the years; Hotel Malte was by far the best. Kind, knowledgeable, friendly, helpful staff, no matter what time of day or night you approach the front desk. Comprehensive breakfast buffet, including a variety of hot and cold items, plus friendly staff who offer you tea or coffee. As a unique and added bonus, their network of Astotels on the Right Bank invites Astotel clients staying at any Astotel to come in, between 2 pm and 2 am, for a snack, a rest and to use the washroom. Hotel Malte is superbly located within walking distance of the Louvre, Notre Dame, la Sainte-Chapelle, l'Opéra, la Seine and close to métro Bourse and les Pyramides. The hotel is nicely decorated, modern and clean. Our room (510) was also clean and nicely decorated. It had a large window opening out to the courtyard; facing the courtyard guaranteed a quiet sleep. The bathroom was very modern, and featured something I haven't come across in a Parisian hotel before: a bathtub. The closet was big enough to accommodate our clothing, two terrycloth robes and slippers were supplied, and the mini-bar was restocked everyday with bottles of water and juice at no extra charge. The elevator worked all the time and was big enough for a few people and their luggage. There is nothing we didn't like about our stay at this hotel, and next time we go to Paris, I will be able to save myself hours of research on TripAdvisor, and simply book Hotel Malte, as they are doing everything right. Thanks, Malte, for a great, hotel experience in Paris.\n",

Beautiful!! Would happily return to the hotel and very good value as breakfast with fresh fruit is provided every day ..delicious options as well as afternoon and evening snacks and tea. Don’t forget the hotel includes 17 other locations that welcome your respite and free clean restrooms. Loved the fresh flavored water each day with lemon,lime and mint. Have nothing negative to report. \n",

      "  review_body : I highly recommend choosing the Hotel Malte Astotel for a pleasant stay in Paris as the service, the location, the hotel decoration, the food including free drinks and refreshments during the day to late night make it a special and, I'd say, unique place in Paris at such a reasonable price! From the moment I stepped into the hotel I just knew I'll be back here as soon as possible and am happy to share my recommendation with other tourists who want to feel in a hotel as if they were at home. The room has all the facilities that you need, the bed is comfy and I could even hear birds singing outside in the morning as it was so calm. The hotel service simply exceeded our expectations! We brought back home beautiful memories from Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed for three nights in June and highly recommend this hotel. From the minute I checked in the staff was so friendly and accommodating. First of all, it's in a fantastic location which allowed me to walk to all of the major attractions that I wanted to see. The room was very comfortable, albeit small (but hey, it's Paris not Montana) but very nicely appointed with everything that I needed (wifi, room safe, hairdryer, etc.). Breakfast wasn't included in my price but for 10 euros I decided to have it there anyway considering that I would pay that much if not more if I went to one of the local places. Plus, it was very good. Also, it's worth noting that the chain has other hotels in Paris which you can use for restroom stops and free wifi if you stay at any of their hotels. Also, they have free drinks (coffee/water, etc) and snacks. I highly recommend this hotel if you're thinking of staying in the area. Also, for the first time ever, I'd say that the traveler photos don't seem to live up to just how nicely this hotel is decorated and kept up. I really feel like I found a hidden gem in Paris and would stay there again (fingers crossed!). I'm giving it four stars only because the rooms are not exactly sound proof and I could hear my noisy neighbors, but that is my only negative observation.\n",

The Astolel chain provides good tour support with breakfast and bottled water so one can be out the door all set for the day. And because the entire chain provides hospitality for guests staying at any of their hotels, one can drop in at any of their locations for refreshments breaks and rest.We enjoyed being served by Ty at breakfast. She is attentive and efficient, making sure we get what we requested in a timely manner. The front desk is also capable, friendly, and professional.

The staff especially was the highlight. The staff were extremely helpful in assisting us as this was our first time in France. They were able to answer all of our questions and help us book tickets and figure out transportation. The hotel even stored our suitcases for us as we travelled to another part of France for a few days. The surrounding streets were bustling with bistros. The metro is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The open snack bar came in handy at the hotel as well. Overall, this hotel was phenomenal and if I ever find myself in France again I will definitely be coming back to this hotel!\n",

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, from calling taxis to buying tickets to museums. The daily breakfast (pastries, cheese, fruit, crepes, etc.) was included in our room rate, and they have complementary snacks set out at night. The room was a bit smaller than we are used to in American hotels, but I guess this is standard in Europe. The drinks in the room fridge were complementary and the fridge is re-stocked every day. We had a hard time getting used to a shower with no shower curtain, though. One false move with the hand held shower, and you've got a wet bathroom. I'm sure the housekeeper appreciated that.It's about a ten minute walk to the Louvre, and the closest Metro stop is at the Opera, which is about another ten minute walk in a different direction.If we ever go back to Paris, the Hotel Malte will be our hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I arrived May 7th. We stayed for 5 nights at this excellent, centrally located boutique style hotel, just a 6 min walk to the louvre, and a few minute walk to the Opera House/Galeries Lafayette. We were welcomed by a most professional, friendly receptionist, named Gemma, and she was quite a gem. She was enthusiastic and eager to warmly advise us and assist us in every matter. The hotel staff and the wonderful hotel manager Stephanie came thru with every special request we asked for above and beyond what we ever expected. Gemma assisted us with a special room (close by to the reception to our request). She also advised us with the best metro/bus app, how and where to obtain a Navigo weekly pass and sim cards for our phones, she explained us where the best places to visit are and which places she suggested to avoid. These and other tips were extremely helpful and saved us a lot of time and money ensuring a smooth experience. I thought that the friendly service was extremely personal. I felt that the staff was sincere and caring looking out for our best interest and it was obvious to both my wife and I that they really wanted us to just have the best time we could. Stephanie and Gemma were attentive to our needs and every special request. She even took the initiative to search online to help us locate the types of places and restaurants we were interested in visiting. They constantly asked if they can help us in any way. The entire reception team (whom I don’t remember all the names) were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was a standard double room. It had everything you need in a room. Good size, quiet, clean, newly renovated and excellent room temperature. The cleaning service was excellent. Every day they made up the room like it was the day we got it. The room was not small as are many hotel rooms in Europe, but rather a decent mid-size room. Bathroom was excellent and big, everything was newly renovated. There were many mirrors in the room, an excellent makeup mirror for the ladies. There's a small mini bar which the hotel fills up daily (free of charge) with bottled soft drinks/bottled orange juice/water. I thought that was a great perk. But there's even a better one, between 2 pm and 2 am the hotel lobby has an excellent (constantly running) complementary refreshments buffet full of cakes, donuts, chips, cold drinks, hot drinks, coffee machine, bar, nuts, vegetable dips etc. It’s kept very clean and was constantly replenished. The staff is very dedicated to the hotel and customer service. Even coming back at 1 am, the receptionist brought me something from the kitchen to my special dietary request, another example of unexpected personal service.Breakfast was wonderful, fully serviced, hot food, salads, fresh fruits and juices, fresh begets and pastry. Fresh Coffee brought by a waiter.That being said, I'm not only recommending the Malte Astotel Hotel to future guests looking to enrich their trip to Paris, but I also want to personally thank Stephanie, Gemma and the rest of the staff for your personal and professional service. Next time in Paris, we hope to see you again.Sincerely Pinchas\n",

Maybe it's me, but I just can't seem to shower in European showers with that glass covering the first third of the shower. The floor is just soaked by the time i'm done, and instead of trying to be environmentally conscious about not using too many towels, I'm using the whole allotment trying to dry the floor! Ok, done venting.This was a new area of Paris for us, and i'm glad we tried it out. Lots to see, easy to walk. I would give 5 stars to Gemma, who greeted us at the front desk. We were tired and hungry. She got us into our room quickly, and explained everything, including these special deals at other Astotels in Paris. She vas helpful with suggestions on where to eat, walking directions, just about anything we needed to know, Gemma had the answer. I hope she is a valued employee!\n",

      "  review_body : Having stayed twice previously in St Germain des Pres, we were uncertain about staying in a new area. We happily found Hotel Malte to be nicely situated, with easy access to the Metro and many surrounding sites -yes - it is very easy walking distance to the Louvre - (but then you end up waiting 10X longer in the ticket and security lines at the Louvre than the walk from the Malte) The rooms are small but spotlessly clean -we stayed in the standard room - and the breakfast buffet makes it difficult to leave the table. Salmon, scrambled eggs, bacon, a wide variety of pastries, on and on dining delights. Also, later in the afternoon additional treats are put out for the the guests. The front desk staff - Gemma, Alejandro, Thomas, Elvira go WAY beyond just helping you - they want you to be comfortable and at ease. It's always possible to stay in a nice hotel, but when the front staff makes you feel like you're \"at home\", the hotel gains more than just a few stars- you know you made the right choice. Many thanks to all of them.\n",

I like breakfast tea at any time of day with cold milk, not cream and they were very accommodating.

The Arc De Triumph is literally around the corner and there are so many awesome bars and restaurants in walking distance!We didn’t have the breakfast as we wanted to venture out each morning, but it looked very nice. There’s also a bar with a brilliant mixologist who does personalised cocktails!The room itself was very nice, the style is modern but a bit quirky which we loved. The windows look out onto beautiful old buildings and let lots of light into the room.The hotel were very attentive and were contacting us a week before our stay, sending food recommendations and even have a system where you can make dinner reservations through the hotel, which we did for our second night. This service was very helpful.One downside was that there is no bar fridge in the room, so we couldn’t keep cold water or any other drinks. We felt this was a bit strange and is probably to encourage guests to purchase from the bar, but I really think a bar fridge is a basic that should be in every room. Overall we loved our stay and would visit again!\n",

From the moment you walk into the hotel you are treated as a valued guest and nothing is too much trouble for the young and vibrant staff. The rooms are small but they are well thought out and to be honest if you are in Paris you are not going to waste time in your room. The shower i good and once you have learnt how to squeeze past your partner, all is good. The bed is really comfortable. Breakfasts are a veritable spread and the beer is only 3 Euro, bargain. We had the pleasure of meeting the owners on the Saturday, they had come to the hotel and were doing some maintenance and making sure that all was well. Nice to see such hands on management and having met them can see why the staff are so lovely. Definitely recommend to friends.\n",

Love the muted colors and unique decor, the intimacy, the relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, super comfortable beds, fantastic breakfast, fab bar. It’s not a big and flashy American style hotel - so don’t come here if that’s what you want. It has everything you need, everything works, staff is obliging and helpful and friendly. Not a typical family hotel but we had our 8 year old grandson who was made to feel welcome amongst the cool millennials and mainly couples and singles. They rustle up tasty tapas and inventive drinks at any hour. It exceeded expectations. Still can’t believe how reasonable the price was. \n",

      "  review_body : Overall, I most appreciated the excellent service, beautiful decor and airy room. I found the concierge extremely helpful, and the overall service superb. There was one strange issue that came up. The entrance and walk in closet carpet was soaking wet when I arrived. That explained why the heat was on approximately 85 degrees in the room. I unpacked and with limited time to move rooms as the evening of arrival was my only time to visit Paris making every minute wasted most costly to me personally. So I ended up making the best of the bad situation by putting down towels and a robe so I could walk around the room without soaking my feet. I wonder how the staff could rent a room for over $1000 night where they knew the issue . They likely cleaned the carpet ahead of my arrival, turned up the heat to max and hoped the carpet would dry--but it did not for the entire stay. They should never have rented my this room. I mentioned to the cleaning staff and front room but there wasn't anything they could do but move me. The mistake that cost me was they SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASSIGNED THIS ROOM TO ME. THEY OBVIOUSLY KNEW THE PROBLEM AS THE HEAT WAS ON 85DEGREES. Everything else was perfect. I enjoyed the gym, pool, food etc. The staff even kindly and speedily put a Nespresso in my room on my request. It's just a shame they assigned me to a room with such a problem. Sometimes guests do not have the time to change rooms......\n",

      "  review_body : I have stayed at many 5-star hotels, but Le Bristol takes 5 stars to a whole new level. Not only is the hotel itself perfection to the “nth degree,” but the staff is equally stellar. I was told that the hotel is “very Parisian,” so I had anticipated a somewhat stuffy, formal and reserved atmosphere. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Upon arriving on a Wednesday afternoon, I was invited to a 6:30 pm cocktail reception to meet Leah Marshall, the Hotel Manager, as well as other guests. I immediately felt as if I were attending a friend’s cocktail party. My room was beautiful and comfortable, with every amenity. The food was so delicious, and the atmosphere in both hotel restaurants, so pleasant, that I ended up eating breakfast & dinner there the entire week - french toast is incredible! The Concierges (particularly Jean-Francois) were knowledgeable, personable & helpful. One day I forgot my ticket to the Eiffel Tower tour so one of the Concierges met me nearby and delivered it to me ! Another day I thought I left my wallet at a nearby bakery, so Sonia, the Head Concierge, insisted on accompanying me to the bakery to find it. When it wasn’t there, she went with me to my room & helped me go through everything until I finally found it. Ms. Marshall seemed to be everywhere at once, so anytime I needed her, there she was ! As wonderful as is Paris, & as much as I enjoyed the City of Light, I have to say I enjoyed the hotel just as much, if not more, than I enjoyed Paris.\n",

Very impressed with the room - everything was done to perfectionFood:Epicure was another phenomenal experience - a definite must try at this establishment within the hotel. Hands down the best European 3 Michelin Star experience thus far Service/People:I truly believe and agree that it is the people that makes the (big) difference. I very much appreciate the hotel staff whom recognise almost every guest in residence by name and their passion to provide the top level of service and yet having meticulous attention to detail.

      "  review_body : What can one say that has not been said? Once you strip away the obvious ...the prized location, beautiful building, and tasteful rooms, what remains is exactly what differentiates it from the others...so here goes, the Bristol has a staff that simply loves what they do and a management team, embodied by the ever present, formidable and always charming Leah Marshall, that allows, née fosters its staff to be themselves. It feels real because it is real, and in an ever increasing world of sameness, it is a joy to stay there ... To walk through the courtyard in the morning and have a conversation with the gardener about some glorious magnolia tree he has lovingly cared for, or to get a detailed report from the bar tender on why gin has become so popular again (apparently we can thank the Spaniards) or a concierge that not just gets you into the great restaurant but makes sure you are at right table ... simply put, the place is teaming with well mannered, well trained, charming characters that know how to do their job and are having fun doing it. Thank goodness these places still exist. That is why we have been making the trip from our home in the Caribbean to our “home in the 8th”... and that loyalty has never been taken for granted. My wife and I have a teen daughter that we hope one day she will spend a year in Paris during college. When this topic comes up, I have always said ... “and if you ever have a problem, what would you do? She looks at me and says grudgingly ... I know, dad, if I ever have a problem, I would go the Bristol”. Well, what more can one say other than that?\n",

      "  review_body : I’ve had the pleasure of calling Le Bristol my Parisian home for 7 years, with 14 stays and counting. As an inaugural member of France's conveted ‘Palace’ hotel classification, it set the bar to which other hotels had to aspire. The hotel has a beautiful understated elegance, is exceptionally well maintained, the suites & bathrooms are spacious, has a stunning inner courtyard, a great bar, and the best restaurant in Paris. The staff are the most warm and genuine I have had the pleasure of interacting with (travelling to circa 50 countries, and internationally 3-4 times per year). And the Concierge is second to none – my having set two almost near impossible asks they absolutely knocked it out of the park (exceeding my expectations). Treat yourself – book a stay!\n",

Guests are family at Le Bristol. Service is friendly, sincere, professional, warm and every staff member does their utmost to make you feel special, truly, a Joie de Vivre experience. The concierge goes above and beyond to be of assistance. Museum passes, dinning reservations, missing luggage assistance, rental car reservations, rental car pick up, car service, you name it, they do, fix it and get it done for their family of guests. Le Bristol offers the largest well-appointed rooms in Paris with excellent bedding, bathroom amenities and excellent Wi-Fi! If you really want to feel like a movie star, have dinner in your room with your own butler! If you want to feel like you are on a cruise ship, visit the roof top indoor pool with stunning views of Paris and Montmartre. In the morning, guests are treated to an exquisite breakfast of fresh squeezed juice and freshly baked breads and beautiful croissants. For an exceptional dining experience, the hotel offers a Michelin 3-star and a Michelin 1-star restaurant both serving unforgettable refined French dishes from chef Eric Frechon. Relax in the glamorous bar, sipping one of the artisan cocktails while listing to the local DJ spins familiar tunes. If that isn’t enough, afternoon “Tea” is a must! Do yourself a favor, when you visit Paris for business or pleasure, stay Le Bristol. You will truly understand how it feels to be pampered from the minute you arrive until you must say, “goodbye”. We will be back! A Big Thank You to the entire team at Oetker Management! The Jetsetz.com Team!\n",

      "  review_body : We booked Le Bristol having wanted to visit for some time and as we had booked a weekend stay. Our visit was to cover two hotels in two days and unfortunately our weekend coincided with the yellow jacket protests in Paris. We tried to walk to the Bristol amid a police lockdown on the streets and our hotel at the Ritz called the Bristol to say we were on our way by walking- having navigated streets cut off -we eventually made it to the Bristol in one piece!!It was an oasis of calm with all staff ready to make our stay amazing as we could not leave the hotel due to the protests.We just have to say this hotel went above and beyond service excellence as in effect we were hotel bound and what a beautiful hotel to spend our time.On arrival we met the fabulous Leah Marshall - the hotel Manager who warmly greeted us and invited us into the Le Bar for drinks. I need to say - having visited many hotels at 5 star level world wide - Leah Marshall is one of the finest and most professional Managers who excelled in dealing with a hotel full of guests who were entertained with the skill of making everyone feel welcome and like part of a family! Leah was amazing. She ingeniously arranged for a film “midnight in Paris “ to be played on a massive screen and drinks and canopies flowed thereafter ! It was fabulous and everyone enjoyed it. Leah then arranged for a tour of the kitchens and the wine cellars and a tour of the new bakery whereby the Bristol has pioneered a new bread making approach which was amazing. We all saw the epicure chefs too in action. Again Leah managed to keep all her guests engaged and delighted by this unique experience!! It is a true test of her skills in the face of unexpected circumstances to ensure her guests were given the star treatment.As to the hotel - our room fabulous and again a welcome gift awaited us!! The bathroom huge and of course we ate in Epicure the 3 star Michelin star restaurant- amazing!!!Even though it was December it was nice to sit out in the courtyard sipping a champagne!!!Le Bristol was a great experience and the mark of this hotel was the exceptional management and all the staff we encountered- the true test of a wonderful hotel!! This hotel sets itself apart by such this amazing manager who made our stay unique!! Thank you\n",

      "  review_body : No visit to Europe would be complete without a stay at my favourite hotel, Le Bristol. They set the bar so high and nearly always achieve or exceed it; this does however mean even the smallest failing become noticeable in the rare occasion they do not. Sadly on this visit they didn’t quite hit the mark. But still a very enjoyable stay, and I’ve already made my next reservation. More details...Arrival was, as always, very personable and warm. The suite was beautifully appointed, with views over the garden with mini-forest of Christmas trees. Their strive for continuous improvement is obvious, with new larger televisions since my last stay (the last not dated). Housekeeping was very good. Dinner at Epicure was exceptional.As for breakfast, the food was delicious. Sadly, on the first day the service was lacking - having to place an order for champagne twice (and slow to serve), and toasted bread also being forgotten. On the second day, the service was flawless. In terms of lunch at Cafe Antonia, warmly welcomed back as a returning guest. The food was good. A few detractors in terms of service however - no vegetarian menu provided, a confusing conversation with the waitress on allergens to which she did not return with the answer to a follow up question, water not replenished, plates uncleared for ~10 minutes. Still enjoyable, however not to the usual standard. Drinks at Bar du Bristol were enjoyable. Sadly, they no longer offer a welcome drink which has been a staple since the bar first opened. And I feel the addition of their neon “Le Bristol After Dark” sign (illuminated even on non-DJ nights) is a detractor and, depending on your seat, obscures the unique artwork above the bar due to reflection. See photos. The treatment at the spa was excellent. As always, there was a warm welcome back as a returning guest. Room service was very good, with a good selection of vegetarian dishes. It did however take some time to place the order, with the telephone initially engaged for several minutes. And finally, staff. Excellent service is what sets apart good hotels from great hotels. Whilst I appreciate with any organisation that attrition is unavoidable, more recently with each stay I discover another staff member I knew well has departed for pastures new. As a regular guest it is saddening to see. That said, there is a solid management team in place at Le Bristol and I’m confident that they are doing all to retain their most valued asset - their staff.\n",

      "  review_body : This was our first trip to Paris, so after much research and reading of blogs etc we selected K+K hotel for our stay. There are so many options in Paris, and many varying options of which areas are best to stay in etc, so it was hard to know where to choose. I am happy to say we were not disappointed, the location was fantastic, surrounding streets filled with unique finds, and the hotel itself just lovely. A boutique experience at reasonable rates with fantastic staff. We usually tend to prefer getting out and about for breakfast when we holiday, however the breakfast included in our stay was lovely and we ended up eating there on two of our three mornings. While not a huge buffet selection, what was on offer was of exceptional quality and we couldn't have been happier. Thank you for making our first trip to Paris so memorable!!\n",

Based on our previous experience, we had absolutely no hesitation in rebooking this hotel.Location: Outstanding! Right on the edge of St. Germain. Easy walking distance to the Seine/Louvre/Orsay. There is a Metro station right out the front door. and a great little bistro right next door.View: We had a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower, which we had requested as it was our daughter's first visit and we knew we would spend time in the evenings in our room. We had previously stayed on the other side of the hotel and had a great view of the Boulevard and Sacre Couer.Room: Very clean. Comfortable for the three of us. Perfectly terrific bathroom(though a bit small). Nice furnishings, comfortable bed and a nice tv.Breakfast/Cocktails: Great breakfast buffet for us to get started fed, warm and fresh each day. In the evening my wife and I would order cocktails from the bar to enjoy in our room. The bartender remembered our preferences and after the first day offered to bring them to our room each evening.Service: Terrific. New Year's day, my daughter woke up sick and I needed to find a pharmacy. Good luck. Everything is closed. The hotel was so sweet in calling around to try to locate one. They also took great care to ask how she was each day. And helped confirm that we had bought the correct medicine for her. Check-in, check-out was a breeze and all questions we had were answered perfectly.This trip confirmed our appreciation for this boutique hotel that we stumbled on 12 years ago.

      "  review_body : The Hotel Balmoral is in the 17th arrondissement, near the Charles De Gaulle-Etoile metro stop on Line 1 (use exit 5). It's a very short walk to and from the metro and from there you can get to anywhere in Paris pretty quickly. The hotel itself is a comfortable 4-star property. The rooms are not huge, but well laid out and equipped. The bed was extremely comfortable and our room was very quiet. No street noise at all. Front desk staff were very courteous and helpful. There is free coffee and tea in the lobby along with free pastries during much of the day - a very nice touch! The only caveat is that, like many smaller Parisian hotels, it has only a single, tiny, slow elevator. If you're on the 6th floor (as we were), you may occasionally wait a while. But I would happily stay here again.\n",

      "  review_body : Just returned from a 5 day stay in Paris where we stayed at the Hotel Splendid Etoile and I cannot say enough good things about the hotel and staff. The location and views from the hotel were fantastic. The hotel is located only one block from the the Arc de Triomphe and the views from the balcony (I stayed in Room 506) were unbelievable. It was enjoyable to sit out every night on the balcony to unwind, watch and listen to the sights and sounds on the street while having the best view of the Arc de Triomphe that you could imagine. The Metro station is only a short block away, the stop for the Hop on Hop Off Big Bus is also a short walk away (and recommended to get an overview of Paris). The room was large, modern and clean with a comfortable bed, safe and mini fridge. The lobby and bar were quaint and attractive and for breakfast there was a good buffet with eggs, bacon, sausage, fruits, cereal, juice and all the croissants you can eat. Above all, the staff, and in particular the Chief Concierge Farooq, was the most amazing staff of any hotel that I have ever stayed in. The concierge staff of Farooq, Abboud and Levis were beyond helpful and patient. In need of a wheelchair, Abboud walked more than two blocks to a pharmacy to arrange for the rental of a wheelchair. Farooq set us up with not only great tours, but he saved us ,money and time with his advice and planning above and beyond what I have ever experienced in my substantial travels. My stay at the Hotel Splendid Etoile can only be described in two words, Magnifique! Magnifique!\n",

      "  review_body : I always take a few nights on a long trip at a hotel that has something special in order to create a lasting memory. After the fiascos I had at the previous two hotels on my 24 day journey I was looking forward to my 4 night suite stay at the Splendid Etoile. The suite is on the top floor has no balcony but what a view of the Arc de Triomphe from the Tv room window and while sitting on the sofa I could also see the top half of the Eiffel Tower out the bedroom window. A great ending to a long trip. Now that is why I spent a little extra money for a few nights. You can occasionally hear the sirens of emergency vehicles but it didn't bother me.The subway and RER is literally right out the front door and will take you anywhere as it is a major intersection. Shopping is right down the Champs Elysees and connecting streets. The major department stores are a short ride to the Opera district. The room was immaculately clean, had hot water after waiting a little bit, and they provided 2 free 1/2 bottles of water daily. The minifridge was great for my medicine. There are a few items I would recommend be addressed.I requested the front desk change my mattress because it was hard as a rock. I was told not to worry it would be taken care of. Never happened. So I took the two duvets off the beds and folded them and made a pillow top mattress that was much better and my back did not complain after that. I think the hotel should have some spare mattresses for people who want a different experience than rock hard.The restaurant is adequate for the convenience but I thought the breakfast is to pricey for there wasn't anything special about it. There are cafes and bakeries that you can get the same for much less. And the dinner menu doesn't really have a vegetarian main course.The bath robes are not soft, very scratchy and not pleasant to wear. On many occasions I heard my door open and it was the house service. They never knocked before opening the door. I made my displeasure known to one of them.The room décor was recently updated to a contemporary simplistic design. This is common with most recent hotel updates as they are using grey, silver or white as the principal color - in this case grey. I like warmth and natural wood tones, especially the traditional French walnut of the period of the architecture of the building. The entire room and furniture is grey with a few accents of orange and blue and I admit it is tastefully done. As realtors always tell home sellers the number one color never to use in a home besides black is grey. Very depressing. However I did not rent the room for the décor as much for the view which was worth it.Besides the mattress issue, the staff were very helpful and I highly recommend the hotel.\n",

The staff were, on the whole, very personable and we appreciated the frequent touch of good humour from the guest relations/concierge team. Our room was beautiful and we enjoyed the view; though I would note that rooms on the first floor (as ours was), have a slightly obstructed view of the Arc due to the trees. We had requested a higher floor by email but it was not possible to allocate this when we checked in. That said, you are so very close to the monument itself that it does not matter all that much and it would not stop us returning to this hotel on future stays at all. The room was very clean and the toiletries/slippers/robes etc of good standard for a 4* establishment. The breakfast was yummy - perhaps the best pancakes/wagfles I’ve had in a good while, with very fresh and juicy blueberries. Thank you to all the team for a great stay in Paris. \n",

Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff at the front desk, Benji (Concierge) and Levi. Both offered many suggestions of places we could visit, tours and restaurants in the area. Our room was not ready upon our arrival so they offered to store our bags so that we could go out and explore Paris right away. Yasser at the reception desk contacted the staff preparing our room and expedited the preparation of our room. So we didn't have to wait too long. Yasser even let me go see the room and allowed me to pick one with a shower instead of a tub. Our room was beautiful, spacious, bright, clean and very cool. (It was very hot during our stay). Our room had a breathtaking view of the Arc de Triomphe. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and we loved coming back to our room every night after a long day of tours and shopping. The bath toiletries were made with honey and smelled amazing. We had a romantic breakfast on our balcony one morning and experienced a beautiful sunrise. The hotel is located steps away from the metro and very close to everything. Champs de Elysees was close by so we could walk comfortably there whenever we wanted. Farooq, Chief Concierge was fabulous, he helped us get taxi's and always provided tips whenever we went out for the day. He made sure we were safe and never went into any dangerous places. There were several bakeries nearby and we would walk a few blocks to our favorite one which served delicious chocolate croissants and pastries. Lots of restaurants to eat nearby also.

      "  review_body : Four night stay during the very beginning of June. Temps were in the 50's/60's Fahrenheit and it rained intermittently. We were very happy to have the Metro station just steps across the street -- it saved us from getting cold and/or rained on. If you buy the 10-pack of Metro passes at the station, you can get nearly everywhere you want to go. The hotel is classy, nice. Our room was spacious and the view from the balcony was so special. Around 9pm the Arc just lit up with the setting sun and it was spectacular. The room has double-doors between the balcony and the bedroom. Despite being in a busy area, right on the street, we slept soundly with little to no noise. This was the only hotel we didn't include breakfast in our room rate, because, well, you're in Paris! I didn't miss it. We found plenty of places nearby for a croissant and coffee. Key management was interesting. A physical key is attached to an \"anchor\" that is heavy. The idea is you return the key/anchor to the front desk before leaving the hotel and retrieve it upon your return. They manage it well; we were never really grilled or asked to provide ID. I think they get to know your face and it really isn't a big deal, just different. All in all this was probably my favorite hotel during our 2-week Europe romp and I would highly recommend staying here.\n",

      "  review_body : For our eighth trip to Paris, we decided to splurge and stay in a hotel with a view of a monument. This hotel did not disappoint! We stayed in a Superior balcony room with a perfect view of the Arc de Triomphe. The balcony had a small table and chairs where we enjoyed Champagne every night. Service was helpful and friendly. The entrance to the Charles de Gaulle–Étoile metro stop is right across the street. You can also catch a bus that goes straight to CDG for €18 right across the street. The front desk sells tickets for the bus. Just some things to keep in mind, this hotel is on a busy street so there is some street noise, also the balconies are connected to each other so you may not always have privacy if your neighbors are on their balcony as well. As I mentioned, it was a splurge but it was worth it to do once!\n",

As with most of Paris it is located in an old structure that has been fully renovated inside. The rooms are very comfortable - on the small side, as they are in NYC but elegant nevertheless. It’s very near the Arc de Triumph and the Champs-Elysees and the Paris Metro. We had a beautiful buffet breakfast every morning that was delicious and the staff could not have been more helpful. If we return to Paris anytime soon, we will almost certainly re-book with the Splendid Etoile.\n",

Very easy to walk anywhere in the area and there is a Metro stop literally right across the street. The head concierge was wonderful in helping us to arrange for a babysitting service before we came and we couldn't have been happier with the babysitter that was provided. We also arrived earlier than expected (prior to check-in time), but we were given a room almost immediately anyway (which we did not expect or ask for)...but it gets even better because as soon as we walked in our room we were called back because they were giving us a bigger room with more space for a baby crib. They also provided a very nice touch by giving our baby daughter a stuffed rabbit (we visited a week prior to Easter). I also can't say enough good things about the breakfast...a very large spread of delicious French food.\n",

The thing i liked the most about this Hotel is the unbeatable location next to arc de triomphe and the central three-line metro station Charles De Gaulle, which allow you to visit most of the attractions easily. Breakfast was good, staff was friendly, but unfortunately I couldn't enjoy much because my wallet was stolen in metro station a few hours before checking in, so i spent half of my stay following up with police station and lost-and-found department with no luck. Hotel have nothing to do with this, so i thought it's fair to give it this high rating.\n",

When we arrived around 11.00 a.m. we were greeted with a particularly warm welcome and offered a coffee. Understandably, our room was not ready. We were provided with lots of advice regarding tourist tips and our bags were securely stored at the hotel while we walked around this beautiful city. When we returned in the evening, our bags were waiting for us in our room. When we opened the curtains we were truest amazed at the stunning view of the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is very clean and well run. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. Breakfasts were lovely....lots of choice and served in a side room with views of the Arc de Triomphe.

I researched all the hotels near the Arc de Triomphe and made the right decision for our 5 night stay. We arrived in the early morning and the staff was so welcoming and delivered our luggage to our suite later in the day while we became Parisians (Thank you Farook). Although everyone spoke English, my husband was able to speak French and they all were gracious when I spoke bits of French mixed in with Spanish.This is probably the first time I found the photos of the room to be accurate. When we entered our suite, it felt like home. The view of the Arc was spectacular and I spent every morning, afternoon and evening just watching \"Paris\" through the window. The Eiffel Tower was also visible.We decided to pay for the breakfast and for us it was worth it. The buffet has a variety of delicious items to fill up on before walking in this spectacular city.

The competition is quite big for the hotels in the area offering Arc the Triumph views but I’m sure not all are equally great in every aspect. I did my research and I must say the hotel exceeded our expectations. We are well traveled couple, it was my first time in Paris and third time for my husband. We’ve arrived at the hotel around 10am and were very pleased to receive an early check in. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. We’ve had a corner room, it was spacious, nicely decorated, it felt like we were the very first guests to stay in it - that’s how fresh it was. Lovely bathroom, great shower. Room Views of the Arc the Triumph were spectacular. We’ve had 3 balconies from which we’ve had the Arc views. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to main attractions as well as the metro is just across the road. Perfect stay! Will definitely come back to this hotel and will recommend to family and friends. \n",

      "  review_body : I stayed in the privilege room for 3 nights (this is currently my last night), and I do not want to check out. This has truly been an amazing experience. The entire front desk team and housekeepers were incredibly polite and professional. The moment I got out of my taxi, someone was outside to take my bags. I spend the days around Paris and come back to a clean and comfortable room. I ordered breakfast to my room and it was delivered quickly, hot and fresh. I asked for extra bottles of toiletries, a hair comb, an iron and ironing board, dinnerwear and silverwear, and they were immediately delivered. You have complete views of Paris with extremely close, unobstructed views the Arc de Triomphe from your bedroom and bathroom. You can also see the Eiffel Tower from both points as well. Their light show is great at night. The bathtub was amazing and the water pressure was great. The bed was comfortable. The hotel is fairly quiet. It honestly sounds like I am being paid for this review, but I am normal guest from New York that appreciates good hospitality and the entire staff went above and beyond to meet my expectations. I am here for 3 more days and staying in another hotel in and different part of the city and I am sad I am leaving tomorrow, but I will absolutely stay here again when I come to Paris for the entire stay.

If you want more space, pay up for a Jr. Suite. I found the bed perfect and overall it was a good experience. Great if you only factor in the things in their control. Didn't bother with the hotel breakfast or their restaurant. I prefer a patisserie for breakfast and there are thousand of restaurants in Paris to choose from.

I kindly explained that we had booked 2 rooms with a view, and I was told I only had one room with a view. Since the view costs more, which I had gladly paid, this was unacceptable. After about 30 minutes of the front desk staff attempting to screw us over, they finally gave us a second room with a view. Obviously, they had this room available, since we ended up in it, but were just being jerks and trying to screw us out of what we'd paid for. They were rude throughout the process and didn't apologize. The poor service continued the next morning at checkout, when I was told I'd only paid for one room. I informed the man at the desk that I'd paid for both rooms in full and he again tried to push me on it. Luckily I knew what I'd paid and didn't let him charge me again.

The nice and friendly front desk staff in fact offered 24 hours services and assistances. The housekeeping staff offered room made-up services every morning after we went out. It was really a great and lovely surprise for us when we came back and saw they had put my boys' soft toys on bed so nice.

Opposite the metro exit. Very easy to get to Disney if that’s on your agenda as the RER stops here.Didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment.Staff could not have been more friendly & helpful.

They had a closet to store our luggage in when we arrived (not locked or monitored), and the staff was generally friendly. The only issue we really had was that the cleaning products they used had a really strong, overpowering smell. We just left the window open our entire stay to air it out.

      "  review_body : We love staying at the Hotel Excelsior. We have stayed at the hotel three times and are always sad to leave. The location is superb. The beds are amazingly comfortable and as a direct result of our last stay, we bought a new bed for home! We never had to use the Metro during our recent stay. Although the Metro is a great way to get around, we prefer to use our feet where possible. From Charles de Gaulle airport, it is a simple one-train trip. I would advise getting off at the Luxembourg stop and walking down the hill with your bags.For dinner, we walked up the hill past the Pantheon to Mouffetard most nights. On two different visits to Paris, we have eaten at the Indian restaurant, Safran, on rue de la Harpe, down by the Seine. Our breakfast was at the hotel and good value for money and also easy. We were hungry and the pastries and bread were still warm.Radha, on the front desk, was amazing and helped us with advice. He is an asset to the hotel. The staff in the hotel were all pleasant. It was great being able to use the coffee machine in the foyer early in the morning before breakfast opened. It is common in Europe for rooms not to have tea and coffee facilities. There are a few different grades of rooms. We stay in the comfort rooms with four single beds as we have two sons. The rooms are not huge, but the space works. The rooms have a shelf where you can unpack your clothes and hooks for coats and shirts etc. There is a desk and great Wifi. Overall I would recommend the hotel and can't wait to go back to Paris and the Hotel Excelsior Latin.\n",

      "  review_body : A cute boutique hotel in an excellent location, for sure. The common areas are tastefully decorated with artistic details. In the little sitting room there is a coffee machine where you can get a hot drink all day long -gratis in the mornings and later on paying only 1€. It was very busy when we arrived and we were given a room that was very small and not at all what we had expected(obviously the only one left!)  Luckily the next day they moved us to a very beautiful room on the 5th floor of the main building that looked exactly as the photos that had made us choose the Excelsior for our stay. Breakfast at 10€ is limited (anyway I don't think there is enough space to put up a proper buffet) Croissants are very fresh and smell wonderfully, though. In good weather popping next door to Place Sorbonne to enjoy breakfast outdoors is a more appealing idea. The location is very convenient: 5min to Jardin Luxembourg (and the metro line from the airport), 15 min to Notre Dame or Ile Saint Louis and of course plenty of buses to other sights.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at the hotel Excelsior three times in March 2019, between other travels in France and Morocco. we selected it because of its good reviews, its location (latin quarter, on the RER B line directly from CDG, one stop from the RER C to Versailles, 15 minute walk to Notre Dame) it was the ideal choice for our family of four - the rooms were large enough for four people and our gear, the beds were very comfortable, and it was always very quiet at night (I requested rooms facing the courtyard). Although one could get breakfast at a lower price outside the hotel, we had ours each morning in the breakfast room, which is nicely decorated and well-stocked with french pastries, breads, cereals, yogurt, cheese, fruit, juice, and excellent endless coffee. A nice spot if you are fueling up early before a long day out, and also if you are enjoying a more leisurely morning. The hotel sends an email prior to your arrival to ask if you have any questions or special requests/needs, they were very quick to reply to us, and also sent an email after we checked out each time to see how our stay went. Front desk staff, especially Ridha, were polite, very helpful, and offered some good recommendations and advice for us. Sure it is an old building and a few surfaces may need a touch-up, but after all it is not a luxury nor chain hotel, just one with Parisian charm!

We saw two rooms during our stay and neither ones had updated bathrooms or the cute little stone for that matter. Neighborhood could definitely be better. It got pretty shady at night and was definitely not in the nicest part of Paris even though it is a short walk to notre dame and a not too long walk to the louvre. If you’ve never been to Paris and you’re looking to stay in Saint-Germaine look more towards les invalides because that’s more the heart of it with nice restaurants and shops. However, I would recommend staying near the Champs d’Elysee because you’re in walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, les invaldes, the arc de Triomphe obviously and even the louvre where as we absolutely had to take a metro from the Latin Quarter (over hour walk). And it’s just a nicer area.\n",

      "  review_body : We loved our two-night stay here. Initially booked just because of proximity to the RER to CDG, we discovered that we couldn’t have been in a better spot for sightseeing and restaurants for our last days on this Paris trip. Close to the Pantheon, Notre Dame, and my favorite Shakespeare and Company, not to mention Luxembourg Gardens and the bus line. (Tip: a night trip on bus 84 makes for a surprise, cheap, sightseeing tour. We discovered this coming back from visiting friends at the other end of the line.) Upon arrival and a benign (if lukewarm) welcome, we were happy to leave our bags in the hotel storage room. There were no records taken or tickets for each bag, just signs absolving the hotel of liability. Regardless, we were very happy to not be weighed down with luggage till check-in time, and I never worry about having my thrift store clothes or tiny toiletries stolen, but you might need this heads up if you travel with more valuables than we do. Our three kids were so happy to each have a twin bed after sharing very close quarters the two nights before outside the city. And having a bath and a half to share (instead of jockeying for a turn in a single bath for five) was a real treat. The suite was attractive and had wonderful ambiance. If you want a good location and a real French hotel feel, not some generic chain box you could get anywhere, this hotel is a great choice. The short walk to the train for the airport with all of our luggage was nice and took some of the going-home travel stress down a notch. A good choice for flyers!\n",

Our room was surprisingly spacious, even with an extra bed, and it was comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. Thankfully, there was no street noise at night meaning peaceful sleep for all. This hotel has a great location in the Latin Quarter. We were within a 15 minute stroll to the Louvre, around 10 minutes from Notre Dame and less than 3 minutes from Jardins du Luxembourg, outside of which it is possible to catch the 82 bus right to the Eiffel Tower. There are many great restaurants all around the hotel so we were spoiled for choice.All the staff are very pleasant and extremely helpful with directions, advice, printing boarding passes, booking airport shuttles and the retrieval and return of soft toys left behind while packing. We were extremely happy with every aspect of our stay with Hotel Excelsior and have no hesitation in recommending it to all.\n",

We had a comfortable double bed, clean shower-room, TV including BBC channels, free wifi, room safe and adequate storage space. The elevator was typically tiny, but that's normal! As it happened we didn't eat there; but the breakfast would have been reasonable value at an extra 10 Euros. The hotel is on a mostly quiet side-street (binmen a bit noisy early one morning), close to the Pantheon, the Sorbonne and the Luxembourg gardens; the Luxembourg station has rapid RER links across town including to the Gare du Nord (10 minutes).

      "  review_body : Stayed her with my family including 3 children. We had a suite (which sounds fancier than it was) Whig was great for our family as our children are too young to have two separate rooms. However we noticed a lot of black mould in the bathroom- there is no heating. I spoke to the man on reception who initially told me they were fully booked, however he soon found an new room for us. The new room was ok- clean and quiet. The beds were comfortable. However no heating in the bathroom so a little chilly. The new room was on the 6th (top) floor and the lift/elevator was tiny! Literally only just big enough to fit my toddler’s buggy in and one other person, so the rest of the family had to walk up the 6 flights of stairs. It would have been tricky if I’d have been on my own with a buggy and luggage. The decor in the hotel is quite shabby and in need of updating. The window on our floor had a gap at the side. Safety is an issue- especially with you’ve children - the gap in the rails on the stairs are big enough for a child to fall through. Also there is no lock on the bathroom window or rails to stop anyone falling out so you’d need to watch children very closely if the window was open.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed here for 6 nights from September 29th through October 5th of this year. We chose this hotel based on its location, reviews, and the fact that it had air conditioning. Little did we know that the owner turns off the air conditioning on October 1st. For the next 4 nights we were stuck in a hot stuffy hotel room and unable to open the windows because of the noise from the street. We asked the front desk clerks for a fan and they said that they do not have any. We told them that we were uncomfortable and they seemed very disinterested in our comfort level. This hotel is really more of a hostel. The carpets or fairly dirty and the room smells a bit musty. You can get extra pillows but apparently not after 4 p.m. and you can get a free cup of coffee from a instant machine but apparently not after 11 a.m. There are no mini fridges to keep drinks or snacks in your room and the hotel apparently does not have any ice buckets to offer its guests.People at the front desk seem pained to say hello to you and irritated at any request you might make. The price and location are pretty good for Paris but know what you're buying and don't expect too much. \n",

This turned out to be good for us as it gave us a bit more space and a spare bed to put our suitcase on.Our room had 3 single beds which wasn't a problem for us (being a couple) as we did leave our booking a bit later than I normally would - the beds were really comfortable as were the pillows. The bathroom was really spacious. Loved the timber beams in the ceiling of our 5th floor room. The double glazed windows did an amazing job blocking out the street noise - there wasn't much of that but I left the windows open one night and got to hear the early morning rubbish collection!Don't be put off by the bar next door - we walked passed late at night and could barely hear anything (but looking in the window you could see people dancing and celebrating) - they have good sound proofing too!The reception and housekeeping staff were nice and friendly and there are 2 nice waiting areas upon arriving or leaving. We used their shuttle service to get to CDG airport - €18 each (for 2 or more). Breakfast was €10 each which we were happy to pay but next time will opt for one of the many cafes in the area.\n",

So about a month of research found Hotel Excelsior Latin. We booked this straight away with Hotel Excelsior Latin on there web site and it was a great experience. Then about a week later we had to change the reservation by one day and that was a very easy process through the Hotel Excelsior Latin web site. The hotel was one RER B train ride away from Gard Du Nord. We did the breakfast the last day which worked for us. The room (#48) that was given to us was FANTASTIC. We had one queen bed in a separate room and 2 single beds and also a pull out chair for another single bed in another part of the room. Thewater closet was separate from the shower with rain shower head, sink, and yes a bathtub, which again worked out great for our family. The hotel was located near many major sights. My family chose to walk to most of the sights so that we could experience the streets of Paris. We walked along and stopped at bakeries, shopping in boutiques, and restaurants at every corner. The hotel staff also offered recommendations for hotels near them. Staff was AWESOME, Ridha was the one that we spoke to the most , in very good English which was a plus, and the one who helped us out. He arranged for us Pacific Airport private car to the airport for 60 Euros, the driver was on time and we arrived at our gate ready for departure.\n",

Cons: Maybe a shower door would be good so water won't go on the floor. But I didn't mind it. I just had to use 2 floor towels.

Very close to brasseries and shops, the Haussmann stores are walking distance (rooftop best views in Paris).My only complaint would be there was a power outage the last night we stayed.

Some lovely little bistros nearby, and lots of fashion and more famous eateries towards Boulevard St Germain. We had a room on the 5th floor overlooking the street, but did not find the street noise a problem. Breakfast in the hotel was excellent.The only negative was the demise of the elevator, which was out for most of our visit. Not being as young as we once were we found it a bit of a struggle having to climb up 5 steep flights of narrow stairs each time we need to go to our room. The staff were very apologetic, and arranged for someone to carry our heavy cases down when we checked out.Despite the lift issue, we would be happy to return to this lovely hotel, but would probably seek a floor closer to the ground just in case.\n",

We could walk out our door and find excellent restaurants without ever leaving the neighborhood. Our only issue, it was a holiday time in Paris, and our room faced the street , we couldn't open the windows, too loud outside and it was still warm in our room as it was unseasonably warm during our stay in Oct. With the windows closed, it was soundproof. We should have asked for a room facing the courtyard, next time we'll know. There were a lot of repeat guests there. We didn't buy the hotel breakfast, instead, A Marks and Spencer store was right around the corner. They have a terrific selection of pastries and Americano coffee which suited our needs. We were close to 2 metro stops and it was easy to walk to many key sites in Paris. Loved this neighborhood and would love to stay in this hotel again.\n",

      "  review_body : The room was very small and the bathroom even smaller. This is Paris! However it was quiet and the beds were very comfortable. Everything in the fridge was €5 (even water!) so we didn't have anything and anyway we couldn't open the door with one suitcase on the floor. Our other suitcase had to be heaved on and off the bed every time my husband needed something, and it was difficult to store in the corridor. The internet did not work the first day on Android phone and MS Surface Pro - required the manager's assistance. Breakfast room downstairs is comfortable light and airy with a reasonable choice of continental style breakfast. Espresso coffee or cappuccino cost extra!!! The price of the room was over €100 more on the 2nd and 3rd nights than it was on the 1st night - this seems like a rather excessive seasonal adjustment! The location of the hotel is excellent in a quiet street with plenty of good quality restaurants within 2-3 minutes walk. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Overall we enjoyed our stay.\n",

Temperature controlled AC in the rooms. 5 Euro breakfast was well worth it. Most of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Teddy and Lydia especailly were extremely helpful.Cons: Some hotel noise (the doors were impossible to shut quietly), and street noise if you are on the street side and lower floors. It was extremely hot during our stay, and when we asked for ice they made it seem like quite an inconvenience, even though we were told just to ask for it if we needed it. We lost power one morning, and our key didn't work for one of the days, but they fixed most of it promptly.Overall the pros much outweigh the cons, and I would stay here again.\n",

The room overlooked an interior courtyard of @30mts X 30mts. It was very quiet except when people where out in the courtyard.The room was large well decorated and equipped (TV, fridge, safe). The bathroom was also very nice and well equipped. The TV offered a number of English channels – mainly news but also some regional BBC channels. Our only complaint about the room was that the lighting was “romantic” meaning it was not good for reading at night.The hotel is on a quiet street with more pedestrians than vehicles. Within one block there are a number of bars and restaurants. It is also great for public transport. Within 200 mts there are 2 metro lines and at least 15 bus lines. We were easily able to get anywhere in town.The breakfast was good with a better selection than you normally find in France. The breakfast room is a glass roofed room in the courtyard and in nice weather you can eat outside.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here for 6 nights in August on a multi-generational family trip. We had 5 rooms total, two sets of double connecting rooms and one superior double room. All of the rooms, while somewhat small by American standards, were clean, modern and comfortable. We were travelling with our minor children so the connecting rooms were excellent for us - there was a small vestibule with a locking door outside our two hotel rooms, and at night we could lock the vestibule door and leave the hotel room doors propped open so we could hear the kids. It worked great.August is a quieter time in Paris and while the hotel was busy it was not full. We enjoyed the breakfast room and courtyard area, and especially loved the convenient location of the hotel on a quiet street in Saint Germain. There were plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops open near us and we enjoyed walking around and enjoying the local neighborhood. We were also close enough to walk to many of the major Parisian sights. Front desk staff was helpful and friendly. Overall this was a terrific hotel in an excellent location and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends and family. \n",

      "  review_body : My Husband and I booked this hotel for our Honeymoon Trip to Europe and Paris was our last stop on our amazing journey. This hotel is really well situated for location and the price was fantastic. It is worth booking directly with the hotel to save some $$ and to buy their breakfast plan at a lower rate. The breakfast was fabulous and they even accommodated our need to take breakfast on the go with us as we had some very early departure times from the hotel for our sightseeing adventures. The room we had was very small and absolutely PERFECT for us!!! The bed was so comfy and the bathroom had a deep soaker tub which was amazing after long hot days with lots of walking. What makes this hotel stand out is it’s beyond amazing staff! I can not say enough good things about Lydia at the front desk!!! She was so kind and thoughtful and gave us lots of helpful advice and was the perfect hostess. She even helped me with my French which improved daily the more I was able to practice. A highlight for us was receiving a glass of actual Champagne as a gift from the hotel to celebrate our Honeymoon - the whole stay was Absolutely Amazing. I can not recommend this hotel enough. Easy access to the Metro and there no shortage of wonderful cafe’s and restaurants within a 2 block radius. Staying here was the perfect ending to our wonderful Honeymoon in Europe. Thank you to Lydia and the rest of the staff who made our stay so special. \n",

We recently stayed here for three nights in two rooms (family group of three adults and an 8 y/o). We loved the place and would change nothing except for the weather. Our rooms were next to each other just as we requested and while small they weren't tiny and were clean and well outfitted; the beds were oh so comfy and the bed linens luscious. Staff was personable and helpful. We especially enjoyed being able to return in the evenings and use the breakfast area to relax and have a drink. The fireplace was a special treat but I can imagine the small outside area would be even better in good weather. I spent weeks comparing and researching our stay in Paris. This was just perfect.\n",

      "  review_body : This was our second visit in six months to this great little 3 star hotel which is tucked away in a lively side street off the wonderful Boulevard St Germain (nearest metros St Germain des Pres or Mabillon). The reception staff were always friendly and welcoming and we thought that the modest scale of the hotel gave it an added charm. If you just step outside there is a great variety of bars and restaurants within five minutes walk although the hotel does also have its own small bar and breakfast room on the ground floor. We particularly liked the La Grille bar in nearby rue Mabillon. Centrally located hotels in the French capital are often quite expensive but at around 150 Euros a night for a (smallish) double room this was quite reasonable compared to other hotels nearby which claim to be four star or more but which are substantially more expensive. If you like the Rive Gauche - and it's difficult not to - this is a great location for exploring all that it has to offer. It has now become our regular port-of-call on our frequent trips to Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : We had so many issues on our way to Paris and this hotel, including lost luggage and a lost cell phone. While this may have clouded our experience a bit, I've thought long and hard about this review. The location in the 6th is great, commercial area on a narrow street with piles of shopping and eating. Had a New Orleans type feel. A bit noisy and loud at street level, but quiet inside. We did not take the breakfast and at check-in were not offered the option. Layout of hotel was not really explained, though it is small, so not much to explain I suppose. We arrived without bags and asked the front desk for anything they could spare, they provided 1 shave kit LOL. Not much open on a Sunday, but they couldn't point us towards what stores were in the area to hit either that evening or Monday. Asked for another shave kit later Sunday evening after dinner and the new clerk said the had none. Hotel is usually staffed by 1 person at the front desk and that person will usually have the attitude that they would prefer to be any place other than that front desk working. 1 small elevator, no bell staff. Room was on the small side, but AC was dynamite. European type shower/tub combo with partial enclosure. Decent water pressure, but bathroom flooded every time we showered and the shower/tub combo was raised oddly on a step. Had to work hard not to break my ankle getting in and out. One day we had a tour at the Louvre and asked them to call a cab, since it was drizzling outside (though a taxi stand is less than a 5 minute walk up the block). Clerk informs us the 'cab' is like Uber, not an official cab. I asked about the cost and she stated it won't be more than $15 euros. Huh? It might be $8 euros in a licensed cab based on my research. No way I am getting in an unmarked cab driven by a Somali national. We walked in the rain to the cab stand and it cost us $8.80 euros. Tuesday evening we went out for dinner and we were expecting our bags. Got back that evening around 11.30p to find 1 of 2 bags in the lobby. Front clerk was unhelpful about status of other bag and why only 1 was delivered. We asked him if, when he got the bag tag and it said 2 if he asked where the second bag was. He kind of shrugged. Oh, by the way, the elevator was out that evening too, so I had to lug the bag up 5 flights. I went back down to let him know if the other bag showed up at any time during the night, give me a ring. Walked back up again and then the phone rang, the other bag arrived. Walked back down and then lugged the other bag up. We are pretty experienced European travelers and for $180 euros a night I felt like I could do better. We don't need a lot of hand holding, but even this was scarce by our standards. Can't argue with the location, but you got try a bit to get my business again.\n",

You want perfection. Well relax, your dreams come true at La Perle. The hotel is slap bang in the middle of everything, bars, restaurants, a stroll to the Jardin de Luxembourg and an even shorter stroll to the metro. The welcome is warm and genuine and the rooms, whilst not large by British standards, are positively enormous by Paris standards. Most bedrooms over look the enclosed courtyard at the back which is great because the surrounding area is buzzing at nighttime. We can recommend all the nearby bars (yes, we tried them all in the interest of research) and a top tip is to lunch well as you can get superb cuisine at a fraction of the cost of dinner. \n",

A taxi to the Eiffel Tower is about 10 minutes and will cost about €12. The hotel room is snug to say the least but we didn't spend much time there anyway.

They made us feel right at home, and no question went unanswered or request unfulfilled. Our room was on the garden-side of the hotel, which shielded us from the active nightlife where many young professionals/students congregate in the many street-side cafes and bars.

First impression impressed me. The man at the reception desk was ever so service minded, friendly, and helpful. My room, second impression was also good. A rather narrow entry (which could have been an obstacle had I arrived in a wheelchair or had I been a very big person), but the room itself was cosy, clean and silent (facing the courtyard). The bed very comfortable, and the bathroom too. My only concern was the ventilation which seemed to me at least a bit volatile, however silent (which is a blessing, I loathe ventilation system sounds!). Breakfast was alright, but the quality of the bread, the cheese, and the confiture was not quite up to the rest of the hotel's standard. The breakfast area is very attractive though, and most people will find there what they need for a good start. All in all, yes I can really recommend this place. Especially if you have never been to Paris before. The area is rally one of the nicest ones in central Paris, with excellent shopping, lots of attractions and museums and parks close by.

      "  review_body : Stayed at suite 604 (deluxe suite but no views...).Have stayed at MO, Prince de Galle, 4S and other non palace hotels.Room - decent, large, befitting of 1500E a night. Louis XI style furniture nothing broken but not my style. Very comfortable bed. Not as high tech as peninsula. Good shower pressure.Service - devine. A hotel where everyone smiles and greets you. Every day, every night. Make hotel promotional videos look like a reality. Guest relation ladies glamorous friendly very French. Arrived at 10:30 room not ready (of course) but offered tea coffee biscuits all complimentary in lounge to wait. Kept us entertained after 24 hour flight. House keeping - another superb. Sometimes you get lucky and if you do ask for the same. Second night house keeper will organize every strewn pieces in the room and top up amenities dutifully. Make sure you tip such....Concierge - excellent.Breakfast - only let down. I would strongly suggest hotel general manager go to PDG or 4S or MO to see how others do breakfast. One day at the hotel lounge was enough and it's in-room dining every day since. Others have better scrambled eggs, better bread variety, cold meat choices etc etc.Child amenities - superb. Had balloons soft toy kids slippers etc etc on arrival. Jade member benefits - large bottle of sparking and two bottles of juices whole mountain of macaron.Tips:They have a hotel car that may drop you off at close by locations if it's free but almost never available. Overall will return again if location suits visiting purposes.\n",

      "  review_body : Celebrated our son's 8th birthday with a stay here 2 years ago. And it was amazing! This year, we arrived in Paris 2 days after his birthday, having celebrated it in Barcelona. As always, Shangri-la service was impeccable from the moment we arrived at their doorstep. Check in was a breeze and everyone at reception was so warm and friendly. Then we were escorted to our rooms, and wow, a lovely surprise was waiting for us there! Balloons, a stuffed panda named Bamboo, and an incredibly delicious cake and some madeleines had been set up in the children's room. There was champagne and tea for the adults too. We were quickly assured that the treats have no peanuts whatsoever. I couldn't believe they remembered my son's birthday and that he's allergic to peanuts! Such thoughtfulness and personal touch really set the Shangri-la team apart from others. Priceless! My heart felt so full seeing how happy my whole family was at such a wonderful welcome back to Paris. Our 4 nights in Shangri-la went perfectly as well: rooms always spotlessly clean, Concierge came through with museum tickets when we had a rainy day, topnotch food and service at La Bauhinia (the kids asked to eat there twice), and a fantastic family dinner at L'Abeille on our last night. I have to toast L'Abeille not just for the excellent food but more so for the close attention and care they pay to their guests. Though Orangina is not on the menu, they gamely served it to my daughter when she asked and the chef very kindly customized some dishes for the kids. We thanked the chef for that when he visited our table; he gave us a big smile and said \"I have children too. I know what they like.\" I really appreciated that! There was one last birthday surprise for my son as we had our desserts. The next day, we left Paris for home with smiles and beautiful memories of another perfect stay in Shangri-la.\n",

First to the suite with terrace which needed to pay €1200 more per night, after we said it is too expensive and then postponed junior suite which needed to pay €500 more per night. We felt so embarrassed cause staying in Shangri-La was not cheap already, but the way he kept asking us upgrade made us so uncomfortable... apart from this, the other service is good. \n",

We slept through our breakfast that was part of the package and even though when we checked in we were told we could do the breakfast or receive a $120 credit, upon checkout we were told we could not be credited. \n",

I know it must be difficult to consolidate into 1 booking as the officer does not know who we are. As we do not want to change the rooms during our stay, apparently, after I called the hotel, I happened to talk to Xiao Jing who is in charge of Chinese guests, she and her collegues worked very hard and finally our booking were consolidated. We had amazing stay in the hotel, thanks to Xiaojing, I must say the service staff are fantastic, from the breakfast to room service to front desk..., the only thing is that young guy at the swiming pool had very serious face, no smile, perhaps he was born that way. Anyway, otherwise it was fantastic, Xiaojing even prepared a cake for my god-son's birthday, it was nice indeed.

Our Eiffel view terrace room was lovely, with the old world luxury look but still having a lot of modern amenities without taking away from the classic traditional aesthetic. The rooftop terrace we had was amazing with the views of the Eiffel Tower and the city of Paris - it was particularly enjoyable at night when the lights came on. These views alone are worth staying in this hotel.The food was amazing with the breakfast served on the terrace. I loved how they cater to their younger guests with even a personalised T-shirt embroidered with my sons name. It’s these little things they do that really make you feel special.Everything just runs smoothly and discretely. The staff are so friendly and Tony and the concierge team can do anything you ask and all with a smile. This is definitely a child friendly hotel and we were so sad to leave as no other hotel in our Europe trip live up to this standard (and my son also keeps asking if we can go back to our Paris hotel!).

      "  review_body : Paris for this American and his daughter has always been a dream. We've been looking forward to the day for almost a decade--and just recently, she surprised me with a Dad/daughter trip to the City of Light! We were staying at a beautiful boutique hotel and doing a walking tour when we happened to come by the awe-inspiring Shangr-La. We stood there for a moment, imagining what it would be like to be staying there...I told my daughter \"one day!\" and we kept walking...but we couldn't stop thinking about this beautiful place very near the Eiffel Tower.The next day I looked a little closer at the hotel online. The interior, as expected, was just as beautiful and inviting as the exterior. That's when I took the plunge. \"L___,\" I said to her, \"I have a proposal and I know this is crazy. But: what if we cancelled our stay at this hotel and went to that one?\"My daughter gasped. \"Dad, that's crazy!\" She paused. \"But that would be AMAZING!\" We decided to go for it. Sometimes a spontaneous decision like this can end up being an awful idea. But the decision to stay in this hotel during our long awaited trip was the BEST vacation idea we've ever had! We were welcomed warmly, given a personal tour by the amazing Mathieu, welcomed to the room with a fresh fruit basked and tea, and then, guess what? Had the great fortune of having dinner at the terrace restaurant (I forgot the name) which only offers one of the BEST views of the Eiffel Tower in all of Paris!Wow, what a trip and what a stay. This hotel is now one of our forever favorites and we will definitely be back on our next trip to this wonderful city!\n",

      "  review_body : First let's ignore the cost, it's high but I think valuable for the level of service, and not out of range for a 5 star hotel in a major city like Paris. I also might go so far as to say its a 5 1/2 star hotel, just because while I also love Four Seasons brand, I've never had staff really try to understand what MY desires / needs were and then accommodate.Specifically this was a family trip and we have allergies and sensitivities in my family and as we don't speak French, it was definitely going to be painful to manage at regular establishments finding all the various things this one or that one can eat, combined with picky eaters it's a constant source of pain on our trips... every meal turning in to a hassle of compromise. The staff at the Shangri-La without my asking any more than what various gluten free options they had took it upon themselves to ask a little more, then they met with the chefs of all their 3 restaurants, the executive chef, and the marketing staff put together a little booklet presenting all the options, and ONLY the options, that my entire family could consume grouped together from all the restaurants and made adjustments so that whatever kitchen a dish would come from, I didn't have to care that this was available there, and that was available here... it was a major relief and simplification for our trip and resulted in lots of time saved, pain reduction, and more $ spent on their property. And then there's of course the historical aspects of the property, its fantastic location, its multi-lingual concierge staff, the management of the property keeping the ratio of staff to guest high so there's hardly ever any waiting for anything, currency changing, directions, personal cars, 24x7 staff. We got stuck out in Paris, lots of pick pockets, train station, 1am, trains just shut down sometimes for no reason, Uber is unreliable... not a good situation at all, but one call to the hotel got someone who knew me, and they got us a car immediately... it felt like staying with family where no imposition for your safety or comfort was out of place.I will definitely stay at more ShangriLa properties for business or pleasure in the future, especially if in locales with which I am not very familiar and want to make sure international travel issues don't affect me.\n",

The hotel was very pretty, but the service did not make guests feel special. Considering the cost of the rooms, we simply weren't all that impressed.When we checked in, we were given a tour of the hotel. This unfortunately didn't include the rooftop lounge with Eiffel Tower views. Note-- this lounge is NOT listed in the elevator- it's just room 410 on the 4th floor, so you kind of have to know about it. It felt very rude to keep this information from us.The restaurants were nice and the room was well-appointed. But with all the wonderful places in Paris, I feel no need to return to the Shangri-La.\n"

      "  review_body : The hotel itself is good and concierge was great. However we realise the Front desk / guest relation team is just full of crap. We booked this hotel at this peak season for the purpose to use one of the suite facing Eiffel Tower for photos (30 mins max) and the ballroom (15 mins max)for our pre wedding photos and we made it clear. Just an idea.- our room cost us over Euro 1,000 a night. We had enquired about the availability of the Specific suite on the particular day and the hotel could not commit on promising us availability- which is totally understandable in case they do sell the room. In the end we manage to get into one of the suite to do a photo shoot - for 30 Mins sharp. We were escorted by the staff there and 20 mins later another staff came up to throw us out because another couple also wanted to do photo shoot there. We had hardly gotten started. Then we wanted to use the ballroom for ONE shot, and the front desk told us they have a function there tonight and it’s all been set up and it’s impossible. Later this evening we went to the ball room and realise it’s completely empty. We chatted casually with hotel staff about the occupancy of the ball room and rooms and had found out the ball room was not even in use. So obviously the team could have let us taken a quick photo but instead they lied about it for no reason apart from making life difficult. I can’t say they are wrong as the hotel has no obligation- but when your guest is willing to pay over EURO 1,000 per night to stay just for the shoot, I think it’s disappointing the hotel would rather lie than accommodate. Coming from Hong Kong, we could have pulled some connections with Kerry Group to make sure our requests would happen but instead we trusted the hotel who will do their best to accommodate us - clearly a wrong decision from our side. I will never ever come back to this hotel with dishonest staff and I will make sure the HK office is aware of this unpleasant incident. \n",

Arriving early not expecting a room to be ready, we were escorted to breakfast, then onto the spa area to stretch out and relax. Later, we were guided to our spacious king room with a spot on view of the Eiffel Tower. But wait, there's more! A side staircase led from the hallway up to the rooftop with a private terrace, complete with lounge chairs and overhead heater (handy in early May). The spacious bathroom - also with an ET view! - was well appointed with upscale bath products. Our daily breakfast in La Bauhinia was sumptuous and expansive, including Asian specialties. The food was as delicious as it was fresh, well prepared and always served with a smile. The concierge staff is a Wikipedia of knowledge, timely advice with special access to exclusive local dining and events. Hard to imagine a more exquisite place in Paris for a romantic getaway, anniversary celebration, or a wedding in the lovely courtyard garden. The Shangri-La also has the most Zen pool area, long enough for lap swim; backstroking revealed a lovely cerulean ceiling with lofty clouds, gorgeous! From the front desk checkin greeting (superbe!, merci Marie et Chloe!) till checkout (encore, merci!) every staff member was exceedingly gracious, helpful, friendly, and made us feel like we were the only guests they had. We're officially spoiled, this is our \"it\" place from now on in Paris! Five stars, hands down!\n",

Both the Bauhinia and the Shang Palace restaurants were delicious with a very professional while laid-back (read: not pretentious) service, which we enjoyed a lot - especially with children. The concierge and reception teams were also incredibly welcoming and friendly, just as the pool guards who spontaneously went to search for goggles and floaters for the kids. The pool by the way was totally quiet and incredibly spacious, with a beautiful large bay window from which we could even see a bit of the Eiffel tower. From our floor we got an incredible view of the Eiffel tower lit up at night, a rare sight! We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to return there in the future. \n",

      "  review_body : I was really excited to enjoy a night at a luxury hotel and was disappointed to find out I'd kind of wasted my money here. It's a beautiful building but our room was worn out and the service was rather inconsistent. I booked a room with an Eiffel Tower view and was disappointed to discover that the rooms advertised as the Eiffel Tower view rooms on the Shangri-La website were different from the actual rooms. I booked the room because I wanted a room that had a view but also had the old-fashioned style windows that opened up (to clarify: NOT the terrace rooms. the room was supposed to have a window that opened up but did not). The curtains had holes and scratches, tables had marks on the glass and you could see the wear and tear on the walls.The most surprising and disappointing thing though was when my guest and I went to take pictures on the hotel's grand staircase- something everyone does, whether they're a guest or not it seems. As we were taking photos, an employee literally RAN to us to inquire whether we were guests. He was literally there when I checked in! It felt hostile and made me feel unwelcome, and left a sour taste in my mouth for the remainder of the trip.It's definitely in a prime location but I would just be extra diligent and careful when choosing your room. Maybe they just need to update a few things– as I was checking in, I overheard a guest who was checking out complaining about how their room had no hot water during their stay. \n",

I spent my stay in a Junior Suite with an Eiffel Tower view and honestly the views were just breathtaking. Falling asleep watching the tower glittering away against the night sky is just the best way to end a Parisian evening. Along with the immaculate room, friendly staff, and lovely spa (be sure to book ahead!), their breakfast buffet is simply perfect. I highly recommend it over any other breakfast in Paris.

The amazing beauty and intricate design/decor of the Shangri-La is jaw dropping. Its beauty and intimacy reminded you that you were staying somewhere special. Our particular suite had a full view of the Eiffel Tower - we called it our \"nightlight\" and the children would peer out of the window endlessly.

This hotel was in a great location- close to the metro, walking distance to the lively Latin Quarter, and close to the Luxembourg Gardens! We were upgraded to a slightly larger room with a balcony, which was so wonderful! It was a very comfortable room and was quiet. One thing, would have been nice to have a larger trash can. I highly recommend this charming hotel and I know that we will be back. Thanks for a nice stay!\n",

Clean, modern hotel in a back street leading down to the Pantheon, surrounded by small shops and restaurants. Friendly staff, road gets quieter at night so traffic noise after 12 not an issue. No noise from bars etc as none in the vicinity. Compact rooms clean and functional, could do with more shelves and hooks for stuff in general, but nice bed linen and comfy bed. A good base for visiting Paris being a short walk to Notre Dame and Luxembourg Gardens.\n",

The warmth of the receptionists on my arrival and departure, the beautifully decorated room, the modern and extremely clean bathroom (supplied with beautiful and fragrant shampoo, body wash and rich body cream) were exemplary. My room was on the first floor facing the street but the double glazed windows and silent air-conditioning meant I slept like a baby. I sadly did not have time to enjoy the sumptuous breakfast on offer, that will be for next time. The location is perfect - the heart of the Latin Quarter! Only good things to say. I will definitely be back. Thank you very much to all the team.\n",

Every part of the stay was vey good, the lady at check in was so friendly and offered me a range of rooms, and told em room 1 was a good choice. It is normally one of the rooms reserved for disabled travellers, as it is on the ground floor. This is sometimes an issue in city centre hotels but here it is not a problem at all as you look out onto an interior courtyard. This room has to be one of the quietest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in with a very comfortable bed and well equipped bathroom with a great powerful shower. I did not have breakfast as i don't generally eat that when on business. The hotel is well located close to the RER to the airport and the main metro system. Walking through the Luxembourg gardens every day was a real treat.I would highly recommend this hotel to travellers to Paris.\n",

Didn't have breakfast but had a look and it did not look to be worth 16euro, plenty of other places around to get a decent breakfast for same price.

The hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff are helpful and friendly. Our room was spacious enough with a double bed, single bed and a small table and chair. The shower was amazing. We did not hear any street noise or even noise from our neighbours. Breakfast was great value for money and just what we needed before a day of sightseeing. There is a shop a door or 2 away where you can get snacks/drinks etc. Check in/check out was quick and easy and the hotel looked after our luggage on our final day as we had a late flight. We mostly walked around Paris from the hotel. At the bottom of the road the hotel is on is the Notre dame, maybe 10/15 minute walk, from here we used the Seine river hop on hop off cruise to reach the Eiffel Tower. From the tower we walked to the Arc de Triomphe then down the Champs-Elysées and then all the way back to the hotel, it was a lot of walking but a brilliant way to see so much of Paris. We used the river cruise again (bought a 2 day ticket in advance) to reach the Louvre. We also walked from the hotel and visited the bastille and Marais areas. The Jardin du Luxembourg is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We had an amazing time in Paris and if we visit again we would stay at this hotel again.\n",

We were checked in by Karim and he is amazing. We had booked a Double Deluxe room which was 226 square feet with a mini bar /safe. There were small closets on either side of the bed and a small table with two chairs in front of the windows. There was a view of the tip of the Eiffel Tower. The bathroom was a decent size with the best water pressure/shower I have ever used in a hotel. The only negative to the room was that there was really no good place to put your suitcase. You are 2 blocks from the Luxembourg station that is the direct line to the airport. The area felt very safe and there were dozens of restaurants nearby that were reasonably (student) priced. We had the breakfast at the Hotel and it was very good with eggs, bacon, sausage, cereal, fruit, yogurt, croissants, coffee, tea etc. They also had complimentary tea, coffee, and water out in the afternoons and evenings. There was a honor bar set up where you could help yourselves and just let the Hotel know what you took.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at Hotel le Petit Paris based on other reviews. I wanted to love it, but our stay wasn't great. I'll start with the positives: the gentleman who checked us in on the first night was lovely. Very funny and cordial. My husband liked how spacious our room was. (We had paid extra for the largest room for two, the \"Deluxe Double Room\".) The property was situated very close to the Luxembourg gardens and the Pantheon.Now, the bad: the room (#503) was a bit gross. The carpet and walls were stained and dirty. I think this was the first time we actually had to wear hotel slippers. The toilet flush button had been broken out of the wall, so there was just this gaping hole above the toilet that you could see into... it was really gross in there. The 15 euro breakfast was sparse when we ate (at about 9am). For hot food, there was about two spoon-fulls of egg available. On the first morning, there was bacon, which I enjoyed. On the second morning, there were literally two tiny sausages. The rest of the staff at the desk (besides the gentleman I mentioned) was quite cold. We stayed in other boutique hotels across Europe and elsewhere in France during our trip and they all seemed to greet you when you walk in, offer assistance when you want to go somewhere/find something, etc.. Here, we felt ignored. One night when we were hungry at about 10:30pm, we asked at the front desk if there were any places around where we could get food that late. We were told that \"kitchens are closed already but maybe the pizza place across the street is still open, but I don't know\". It felt like we were bothering him. We ended up walking about 4 minutes up the street and finding a cute restaurant called La Crêperie that was open until midnight. I think the staff should have a better sense of what restaurants are around the hotel or at least some sort of guide to help guests.So overall, I give it one star for the gentleman at the desk on our first night and one star for the location.\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is tucked away on a quiet street, but it is perfectly located. There are wonderful little stores all within a couple minute walk, including a couple of great bakeries and a wine store. The staff are very helpful. They answered any question we could have, from what trains to get to Versailles when many stations were closed, to the best casual bistro near Luxembourg Gardens (which itself is only a 5 minute walk away). It is a straight 7-10 minute walk down the street to Notre Dame and the tour bus stops. From there, you can get anywhere in the city.The hotel itself is like a little oasis. We were there in the heat of summer and entering the hotel lobby was a merciful relief. The AC in the room saved us from melting during the 39 degree heat. The room is small, but how much time do you spend in your room in Paris? However, if available, I would highly, highly recommend getting a room with a balcony. We had many night-time snacks out there and it was amazing. Not a great view, but still can't beat having baguettes, cheese, and wine on a balcony on a summer Paris evening. The bathroom is nice and big and a fantastic shower that I want to install in my own house. The toilet had a separate room, but you had to walk out of the bathroom, through the bedroom, and around the corner to get to it and it didn't have a sink. Not sure if that is a European thing or what, but that was weird and I don't like it, but it certainly wasn't a deal breaker. There was a very small sitting area, safe, and closet, so everything you would want, just crammed into a small area. There is really nothing I would change about the hotel (OK, other than the toilet thing). It is a small, quaint, boutique hotel and is perfect for a romantic couple's vacation.\n",

      "  review_body : I booked a deluxe room with 2 twins for me and my daughter and we were super happy with our experience. As a 4 star hotel it is spot on. The room was plenty big for us. It even had a small sitting area, so I recommend upgrading if you want space. We also had no issue with it being loud (even being right next to the elevator). We were in room 402.I also want to shout out to the staff for allowing us to store luggage and come back late in the day. They didn’t mind at all that my teen chose to hang out in the lobby while I went to dinner with friends. My only disappointment was that the gentleman at the desk was new and not familiar with the neighborhood restaurants. The bathroom also showed some signs of age. I am confident that it was clean based on the rest of the room and the hotel, but there was definite signs of wear and tear. Thus the 4 stars when I would have given 5. Oh! And Wifi worked well. Yay!\n",

As we were three adults, we booked two rooms.One of our rooms (both on the 5th floor) had a peek of the top of the Eiffel. What a treat and surprise to look out the window to the twinkling of La Tour Eiffel. The Team was superb in ongoing communication when we experienced a family emergency that delayed our travel for a number of months. The location is spot on, near to Luxembourg Gardens and mere blocks away from the Pantheon. This wasn’t our first trip to Paris but it was our first stay in this location. The breakfast selections were delicious and abundant...this acknowledgement coming from a gal that loves a good breakfast! It is certain that a future visit to Paris will once again find us at Hotel Le Petit Paris. \n",

      "  review_body : My husband and I stayed at Hotel le Petit Paris in January for 4 nights. I was tagging along on a business trip and had just hoped for a comfortable and attractive base for us to come back to every day. The hotel had been recommended by a friend. It could not have been better. Our room was lovely with an extremely comfortable bed, French doors to a tiny balcony and a nice bathroom with shower. The decor in the front lobby, lounge area and breakfast area is contemporary and attractive. Everything is impeccably clean. The hotel was perfectly located for us as we needed the RER B at Luxembourg Metro, a 3-minute walk from the hotel. It was also walking distance from a good selection of restaurants and the Jardin du Luxembourg. However, the best part of our stay was the staff. Unfortunately, I was suffering with terrible back pain and it rained heavily for most of the 4 days, making my time in Paris much more restricted than I had hoped and quite disappointing. The friendly welcome, suggestions and assistance offered throughout our visit by Karim and Gwen at Reception made my stay as good as it could have been. The hotel felt like an oasis of calm, positivity and comfort with a lovely breakfast served in the morning and tea in the afternoon. I’ve been to Paris many times and have never been made to feel as welcome as I was by Karim and Gwen. They are really the USP of this hotel. I am looking forward to a future visit to the hotel at a time when I can get around a bit better and also use the lovely outside courtyard. I have now recommended Hotel le Petit Paris to all our friends. \n",

      "  review_body : Overall, I most appreciated the excellent service, beautiful decor and airy room. I found the concierge extremely helpful, and the overall service superb. There was one strange issue that came up. The entrance and walk in closet carpet was soaking wet when I arrived. That explained why the heat was on approximately 85 degrees in the room. I unpacked and with limited time to move rooms as the evening of arrival was my only time to visit Paris making every minute wasted most costly to me personally. So I ended up making the best of the bad situation by putting down towels and a robe so I could walk around the room without soaking my feet. I wonder how the staff could rent a room for over $1000 night where they knew the issue . They likely cleaned the carpet ahead of my arrival, turned up the heat to max and hoped the carpet would dry--but it did not for the entire stay. They should never have rented my this room. I mentioned to the cleaning staff and front room but there wasn't anything they could do but move me. The mistake that cost me was they SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASSIGNED THIS ROOM TO ME. THEY OBVIOUSLY KNEW THE PROBLEM AS THE HEAT WAS ON 85DEGREES. Everything else was perfect. I enjoyed the gym, pool, food etc. The staff even kindly and speedily put a Nespresso in my room on my request. It's just a shame they assigned me to a room with such a problem. Sometimes guests do not have the time to change rooms......\n",

      "  review_body : I have stayed at many 5-star hotels, but Le Bristol takes 5 stars to a whole new level. Not only is the hotel itself perfection to the “nth degree,” but the staff is equally stellar. I was told that the hotel is “very Parisian,” so I had anticipated a somewhat stuffy, formal and reserved atmosphere. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Upon arriving on a Wednesday afternoon, I was invited to a 6:30 pm cocktail reception to meet Leah Marshall, the Hotel Manager, as well as other guests. I immediately felt as if I were attending a friend’s cocktail party. My room was beautiful and comfortable, with every amenity. The food was so delicious, and the atmosphere in both hotel restaurants, so pleasant, that I ended up eating breakfast & dinner there the entire week - french toast is incredible! The Concierges (particularly Jean-Francois) were knowledgeable, personable & helpful. One day I forgot my ticket to the Eiffel Tower tour so one of the Concierges met me nearby and delivered it to me ! Another day I thought I left my wallet at a nearby bakery, so Sonia, the Head Concierge, insisted on accompanying me to the bakery to find it. When it wasn’t there, she went with me to my room & helped me go through everything until I finally found it. Ms. Marshall seemed to be everywhere at once, so anytime I needed her, there she was ! As wonderful as is Paris, & as much as I enjoyed the City of Light, I have to say I enjoyed the hotel just as much, if not more, than I enjoyed Paris.\n",

Very impressed with the room - everything was done to perfectionFood:Epicure was another phenomenal experience - a definite must try at this establishment within the hotel.

The service is some of the friendliest and best, if not the best, that will be found anywhere in the world. The concierge team was unbelievable in providing recommendations for us and booking those spots/experiences for us. The team is incredibly knowledgeable on trendy restaurants throughout the city and time of year. I could not recommend this hotel more!\n",

      "  review_body : What can one say that has not been said? Once you strip away the obvious ...the prized location, beautiful building, and tasteful rooms, what remains is exactly what differentiates it from the others...so here goes, the Bristol has a staff that simply loves what they do and a management team, embodied by the ever present, formidable and always charming Leah Marshall, that allows, née fosters its staff to be themselves. It feels real because it is real, and in an ever increasing world of sameness, it is a joy to stay there ... To walk through the courtyard in the morning and have a conversation with the gardener about some glorious magnolia tree he has lovingly cared for, or to get a detailed report from the bar tender on why gin has become so popular again (apparently we can thank the Spaniards) or a concierge that not just gets you into the great restaurant but makes sure you are at right table ... simply put, the place is teaming with well mannered, well trained, charming characters that know how to do their job and are having fun doing it. Thank goodness these places still exist. That is why we have been making the trip from our home in the Caribbean to our “home in the 8th”... and that loyalty has never been taken for granted. My wife and I have a teen daughter that we hope one day she will spend a year in Paris during college. When this topic comes up, I have always said ... “and if you ever have a problem, what would you do? She looks at me and says grudgingly ... I know, dad, if I ever have a problem, I would go the Bristol”. Well, what more can one say other than that?\n",

The staff are the most warm and genuine I have had the pleasure of interacting with (travelling to circa 50 countries, and internationally 3-4 times per year).

Guests are family at Le Bristol. Service is friendly, sincere, professional, warm and every staff member does their utmost to make you feel special, truly, a Joie de Vivre experience. The concierge goes above and beyond to be of assistance. Museum passes, dinning reservations, missing luggage assistance, rental car reservations, rental car pick up, car service, you name it, they do, fix it and get it done for their family of guests. Le Bristol offers the largest well-appointed rooms in Paris with excellent bedding, bathroom amenities and excellent Wi-Fi! If you really want to feel like a movie star, have dinner in your room with your own butler! If you want to feel like you are on a cruise ship, visit the roof top indoor pool with stunning views of Paris and Montmartre. In the morning, guests are treated to an exquisite breakfast of fresh squeezed juice and freshly baked breads and beautiful croissants. For an exceptional dining experience, the hotel offers a Michelin 3-star and a Michelin 1-star restaurant both serving unforgettable refined French dishes from chef Eric Frechon. Relax in the glamorous bar, sipping one of the artisan cocktails while listing to the local DJ spins familiar tunes. If that isn’t enough, afternoon “Tea” is a must! Do yourself a favor, when you visit Paris for business or pleasure, stay Le Bristol. You will truly understand how it feels to be pampered from the minute you arrive until you must say, “goodbye”. We will be back! A Big Thank You to the entire team at Oetker Management! The Jetsetz.com Team!\n",

      "  review_body : We booked Le Bristol having wanted to visit for some time and as we had booked a weekend stay. Our visit was to cover two hotels in two days and unfortunately our weekend coincided with the yellow jacket protests in Paris. We tried to walk to the Bristol amid a police lockdown on the streets and our hotel at the Ritz called the Bristol to say we were on our way by walking- having navigated streets cut off -we eventually made it to the Bristol in one piece!!It was an oasis of calm with all staff ready to make our stay amazing as we could not leave the hotel due to the protests.We just have to say this hotel went above and beyond service excellence as in effect we were hotel bound and what a beautiful hotel to spend our time.On arrival we met the fabulous Leah Marshall - the hotel Manager who warmly greeted us and invited us into the Le Bar for drinks. I need to say - having visited many hotels at 5 star level world wide - Leah Marshall is one of the finest and most professional Managers who excelled in dealing with a hotel full of guests who were entertained with the skill of making everyone feel welcome and like part of a family! Leah was amazing. She ingeniously arranged for a film “midnight in Paris “ to be played on a massive screen and drinks and canopies flowed thereafter ! It was fabulous and everyone enjoyed it. Leah then arranged for a tour of the kitchens and the wine cellars and a tour of the new bakery whereby the Bristol has pioneered a new bread making approach which was amazing. We all saw the epicure chefs too in action. Again Leah managed to keep all her guests engaged and delighted by this unique experience!! It is a true test of her skills in the face of unexpected circumstances to ensure her guests were given the star treatment.As to the hotel - our room fabulous and again a welcome gift awaited us!! The bathroom huge and of course we ate in Epicure the 3 star Michelin star restaurant- amazing!!!Even though it was December it was nice to sit out in the courtyard sipping a champagne!!!Le Bristol was a great experience and the mark of this hotel was the exceptional management and all the staff we encountered- the true test of a wonderful hotel!! This hotel sets itself apart by such this amazing manager who made our stay unique!! Thank you\n",

My expectations were extremely high and they were nonetheless exceeded. The food, even in their most casual lounge, was of great quality, and room service was also incredible. The staff greeted me by name the next morning even though it was my first stay there and for a very short while. It truly deserves to be called a Palace.\n",

What really sets it apart is its commitment to service excellence for each guest and its ambience of extreme elegance in a most tasteful way. Some hotels smile, nod and are polite but the staff at Le Bristol listen. The location is ideal being away from some of the larger more contentious locations. Beautifully decorated for Christmas, the lounge is also quite exquisite and breakfast was cozy.\n",

      "  review_body : No visit to Europe would be complete without a stay at my favourite hotel, Le Bristol. They set the bar so high and nearly always achieve or exceed it; this does however mean even the smallest failing become noticeable in the rare occasion they do not. Sadly on this visit they didn’t quite hit the mark. But still a very enjoyable stay, and I’ve already made my next reservation. More details...Arrival was, as always, very personable and warm. The suite was beautifully appointed, with views over the garden with mini-forest of Christmas trees. Their strive for continuous improvement is obvious, with new larger televisions since my last stay (the last not dated). Housekeeping was very good. Dinner at Epicure was exceptional.As for breakfast, the food was delicious. Sadly, on the first day the service was lacking - having to place an order for champagne twice (and slow to serve), and toasted bread also being forgotten. On the second day, the service was flawless. In terms of lunch at Cafe Antonia, warmly welcomed back as a returning guest. The food was good. A few detractors in terms of service however - no vegetarian menu provided, a confusing conversation with the waitress on allergens to which she did not return with the answer to a follow up question, water not replenished, plates uncleared for ~10 minutes. Still enjoyable, however not to the usual standard. Drinks at Bar du Bristol were enjoyable. Sadly, they no longer offer a welcome drink which has been a staple since the bar first opened. And I feel the addition of their neon “Le Bristol After Dark” sign (illuminated even on non-DJ nights) is a detractor and, depending on your seat, obscures the unique artwork above the bar due to reflection. See photos. The treatment at the spa was excellent. As always, there was a warm welcome back as a returning guest. Room service was very good, with a good selection of vegetarian dishes. It did however take some time to place the order, with the telephone initially engaged for several minutes. And finally, staff. Excellent service is what sets apart good hotels from great hotels. Whilst I appreciate with any organisation that attrition is unavoidable, more recently with each stay I discover another staff member I knew well has departed for pastures new. As a regular guest it is saddening to see. That said, there is a solid management team in place at Le Bristol and I’m confident that they are doing all to retain their most valued asset - their staff.\n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Hoxton. This stay was our first Hoxton experience and was chosen just for checking it out after reading about the brand for the past couple of years. (Normally, I let TripAdvisor guide me to a hotel that suits our needs.)I appreciate design and on this front the Hoxton delivers. Design should provide some functionality though and there were a few aspects to this room in which function is compromised. The bathroom is essentially a translucent glass box, having no true wall separating the bathroom from the sleeping area. There is only one bathroom lighting choice and it’s fairly bright which means whenever someone is using it, the sleeping area is also alit. To minimize disturbing the one still in bed we showered by phone flashlight.I’m always game to experience a doorless shower to see if someone has found the magic combination of geometry, shower head, etc. that keeps water somewhat off the rest of the bathroom floor. That combination isn’t here either as water kind of gets all over the place and you will need to mop up a bit with a towel. Other issues include lack of personal storage area by the sink. The only place for that stuff is above the toilet. There isn’t even a convenient place by the sink to keep a used towel. You have to put it on/in the sink for the next use.Basic elements were successful like minimal noise and the mattress was OK. (Too soft for my preference but my wife liked it.) Note that there is a constantly on HVAC system, which was effective but it made the air very dry and I had stuffiness while sleeping. (I generally prefer heat radiators like most European seem to have.)Putting it all together I would say I’ve had my Hoxton experience and will go back to letting TripAdvisor be my hotel guide.\n",

We did not know about the Flexible check in option when we booked and we did not state at what time we were arriving but the team managed to make everything possible to give us our room so we could rest and go for sightseeing.It was definitely worth staying here all spaces are breathtaking, the design the decoration makes you feel at home. The lobby and restaurant are always buzzing, I love the Asian fusion mix on the menu. The reception team was super helpful when giving advices on how to get around, thank you for your smile and for being persuasive on finding a taxi for us. There was a strike during our stay but the team tried hard to accommodate as there was high demand in the evenings. Lovely 2 days with you, will definitely try the Hoxton in Chicago as we are heading there for New Years. Thank you for a lovely stay we are now true Hoxton fans.\n",

      "  review_body : The Hoxton is a local hotspot where Parisians meet to grab a drink in a locale that is a hybrid between a Parisian “hôtel particulier” and a cozy, Williamsburg, Brooklyn coffee shop.I booked an overnight stay on this visit and was very disappointed. For starters, the front desk is poorly designed (practically hidden), and run by 20-year-olds who don’t appear to have experience in hospitality and are overwhelmed by the constant crowd of people assembled there, waiting.While familiar with smaller European room sizes, this room was extremely tiny and definitely not worth what I paid for the night. There was a lot of wasted space in the bathroom - more space for the radiator around the corner than when sitting on the toilet (with my nose is against the wall)! No toilet paper holders, but in case you forgot where you were, there are cheeky, “Ça roule” stickers on toilet paper rolls above the toilet, which may be the most French thing in the room.The shower doesn’t have a door/curtain, and the tile floor is completely flat and not tapered towards the drain, so you virtually flood the entire bathroom (and room) when you shower. Any extra towels you may have requested must be put on the floor to soak up the water.Probably the most offensive thing about this stay was “le breakfast bag,” a paper bag that you hang outside your door the night prior and check off 1. How many people are in the room, and 2. When you want the bag to be delivered (hung on the hook outside your door.) The next morning, you open the door and receive a bag with a banana, orange juice, and a warm yogurt. When you leave your bag with the front desk upon check in/out, make sure you have something distinguishable on it. Upon retrieving my bag on the way out, I was asked to describe my bag in great detail because of the number of bags they had in storage. I have a black bag! When I asked the woman if she just couldn’t locate the bag by the number on the ticket, she said “no, because they were very busy.” What a joke!Stay somewhere else when visiting Paris. Just go to the Hoxton for a drink.\n",

      "  review_body : Fortunately for me the business I was working for agreed to put me up at The Hoxton for two weeks. Conveniently located close to Opera, Marais, Montorgeuil areas, The Hoxton is stylish and young but also comfortable and cosy. Set in an 18th century palace set back from the street. The hotel has a happening bar and restaurant scene up front in a new wing, with a private entrance to the quiet hotel beyond a small reception area. The architecture is purely Parisienne, a stunning old building decked out to the nines with all the modern comforts and conveniences needed for a great stay business or pleasure. I was immediately welcomed by the young personable staff, who throughout my stay greeted me by name and offered me the attention that you hope for and appreciate on a long visit. They were kind and helpful and interested in my work in the theater. My first room was a very cosy attic bedroom 401. One of the few with a roof terrace. Not huge but very well styled and with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. For the last 4 days of my stay, I moved to a larger room number 7 on the ground floor. High ceilings but a bit of an odd shape, enormous window with a seating area on the courtyard. Lovely in the summer I’m sure. I liked this room less and it was a bit more expensive. All Bathrooms are big and stylish with nice products. Funky tiled floors and lacquered services abound. My only criticism of this hotel was the lack of storage in the rooms. No draws for undies and socks and not enough full length hanging space for suits, dresses etc. The restaurant is fab. Good food, delicious vegan options and a lovely service. Busy during the day for meetings and lively at night. Nice touches: Recommendations board, where you can post your favorite Paris haunts for others to enjoy. No mini bar in the room but lots of goodies on offer at reception in case you get the midnight munchies ( amazing green tea popcorn) Breakfast bags that you can hang on your door in the evening filled with yogurt and granola....that’s free! But there is a full breakfast menu lovely in the restaurant. Great croissants and treats on offer in the atrium coffee bar. Overall a great stay, perfect for a man in his forties who still enjoys a bit of buzz, but also likes his peace and quiet. Comfort 10 Looks 10 Facilities 9 Service 10 Food 10 \n",

So take you flannel pajama with you .Staff is helpful !Don’t book room, facing to garden side, as they explained, its high sealing and take long time to warm it up.First and I hope last experience in this place, better to chose not so sophisticated, but more comfy place.\n",

      "  review_body : The first thing that hits you about the Hoxton, is that it’s beautiful, the interior design of the hotel, the bars and the rooms are perfection. It’s an instagramers heaven, and this is where the issues begin. You’d think the staff are all out of work models, every single one is beautiful, unfortunately they’re so rapped up in how painfully hip they are, they don’t give a rats ass about actually doing their job. My breakfast never arrived at my room on both of the mornings I requested it, And I got no sleep both of the nights I stayed. Despite requesting a quiet room. Which ever genius did the architecture has the majority of the rooms over looking a beautiful external court yard which has one of the bars open in it until 3am. My room was duel aspect so I was lucky enough to get the noise from two bars. The second of which also started to serve breakfast at 6am, leaving me with only 3 sleepable hours a night. On mentioning this to the front desk they didn’t care or want to help at all. Once the Hoxton has your cash, they are then far more concerned about helping the pretentious, over dressed social media/influencer crowd of 20 somethings who frequent their noisy bars until the early hours. My suggestion, come for the bars and stay at a hotel somewhere else. You’ll get better service if you’re not a paying guest. I hope I dont have to stay again.\n",

It’s in a great position in Paris close to the metro, river and walking distance to so many great restaurants and attractions. As is the formula for the Hoxton hotels it is styled to perfection with all the cute and quirky things that make it stand out from other chain hotels. The lobby is gorgeous and makes you realise you have made the right choice as soon as you walk in. The speak easy, wine bar and lobby bar are all incredibly popular with the locals and are busy at all times of the day and night. Breaky bag was great as usual and a nice way to start the day. The staff gave us some great suggestions for dinner near by and the restaurants they suggested were incredible. The only negative thing I have to say is that the water pressure wasn’t great in the shower and the lack of shower screen means you end up with water all over the floor but really it’s not a big deal and I’d prefer to stay here with a bit of water on the floor than stay anywhere else. \n",

      "  review_body : Absolutely LOVED this hotel. Wonderful experience overall with a great location, hotel vibe, staff, food/drinks and rooms! The lobby itself is perfection. I chose this hotel after getting a recommendation from a family member. I traveled to Paris from NYC as a 25th Birthday gift to myself. I had always wanted to go to Paris and decided it was finally the time. I was concerned about choosing \"the right\" hotel - as I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a so so or poor experience. Also I wanted to make sure I felt safe since I was traveling alone. I am SO happy I chose The Hoxton. ROOM: I chose a \"Cosy Garden View\" room. It definitely was \"cosy\" (smaller than my NYC studio apartment) but perfect for my 4 night stay. It is important to note there is limited \"storage\" - so I couldn't really unpack other than using a shelf or 2, but I didn't mind. There is a safe for your valuables as well as a fridge for any snacks you pick up and want to enjoy later. Although the room was petite, it really felt like a great experience. They definitely put a lot of thought into how the room was set up, the shower, the bed, the closet etc. FOOD / DRINK: First: Their included breakfast option (OJ, banana and yogurt parfait) is so cute and so convenient! Second: There are 3 different restaurant / bar options in this hotel! While I was here I dined at Rivie as well as grabbed drinks at 'Jacques Bar.' Both experiences were great! At Rivie, I ordered the Beef Tartare, truffle fries and broccoli as well as a cocktail and a glass of wine - Delicious! Then another night at Jacques bar I got a cocktail as well as the burrata - perfect for a cosy night in. STAFF: All of the staff members were extremely kind, accommodating and helpful. I asked them on a few occasions for suggestions / insight into the best ways to get around the city and where to go. I had found a restaurant online prior to my trip and asked the hotel to make a reservation for me there - then the day of I had second thoughts... I went downstairs ad 3:30pm asking the front desk to help me find a new restaurant. I'm very glad I did. It was a bank holiday and choices were a bit more limited but within minutes I was given 3 options for restaurants to choose from - I ended up going to 'Racines Des Pres' - it was DELICIOUS and I highly suggest trying their tasting menu w/ wine pairing. OVERALL: There are not enough nice things I can say about this hotel. I had the best time at the Hoxton and felt welcomed to Paris. I cannot wait to try other Hoxtons and am sure to return the next time I‘m in Paris! Thank you to everyone that works at The Hoxton for making my trip so enjoyable! Merci Beaucoup!\n",

The staff was so professional and helpful. They have three bars which includes a speakeasy that you can have amazing drinks and listen to music. The main bar off lobby was our favorite because they host live music from some of Paris’ best DJ. You must ask for Jeff at the bar his cocktails had us there every night before we headed out for dinner. He made a special one for my bestie, gimlet with passion fruit. It was our favorite. He’s a gifted mixologist. Also the avocado toast for breakfast menu...yum. We will definitely stay at the Hoxton every time we visit Paris.\n",

The staff are just knowledgeable and friendly. On our first day, the house hosts gave us the 411 on Paris and recommended all the top spots.TIP - If you are travelling to Paris for the first time, I'd advise to go to the local spots rather than the tourist spots such as 'Miss Ko' - although this is a personal preference.The bars are just AWESOME and buzzy throughout the day with just a cool vibe!I'd happily sit here all day long.. from morning until late night, with the occasional outfit changes!The rooms were very cute and quirky. We had a lovely view of the courtyard, which was lovely to wake up to.Without a doubt one of my favourite hotels, ever.\n",

They had a fantastic pop up beach which was superb as i would have preferred to be on the cote d azur in August but it was my wifes birthday and i was over ruled . The pop up had excellent cocktails and i really looked forward to getting back to hotel after a busy day in Paris we had stayed in The Royal Riviera last October and the hotel had a similar feel , The welcome was very chilled and they had a great selection of extra items at reception for shop prices so no hauling 3 litres of water back to hotel[great idea !]The only downside was an overly fussy english restaurant/hotel manager who kept bossing the very friendly staff about in public , Everything about great service is where your backstage is and a more competent manager would take the hotel to another level, looking forward to coming back .\n",

From the warm check-in with Vikash at the front desk to the first moment we walked into our room, where FIP France was playing on the room’s radio, it was perfect! The staff brought us a small bottle of champagne on our first day to celebrate our honeymoon. It was so thoughtful!Filling out the breakfast bag at night and hanging it outside the room door was a lovely pre-bedtime tradition for the 5 nights we were there. Getting coffee from Juan in the mornings was also a highlight from our stay. The staff in general was very friendly and had wonderful recommendations for things to see and do in Paris.

It felt as if we were expected to breakfast in our room and weren’t welcome in the public areas.

Coming from London on the Eurostar, the location was excellent as just a 20 minute walk from Gare du Nord and in the quiet and pleasant 2nd arrondissement. The lay out and decor in the communal areas was in my opinion even more beautiful than in the London Hoxton hotels and bedroom equally beautifully presented with the additional feature of high ceilings and long windows overlooking the courtyard below.The only disappointment was that we were delayed by an hour and a half leaving our hotel room on Bastille Day. This was because we called down for an iron twice and on each occasion nothing showed up despite being told it would be sent up immediately. I then went down to reception to inquire where the guy on reception called housekeeping to chase and I was told again it would be sent up to my room immediately. Another 20 minutes passed and nothing so we called for a FOURTH time and finally got an iron. It was a shame that this let down the otherwise faultless service.\n",

Such a good vibe and you’d really want to spend time in the hotel rather than it being someone you’re only staying overnight. Came for my 25th Birthday and this hotel was a large part of the reason I decided on going to Paris. Great service from housekeeping staff member Jasmina and Jacques at reception in particular when checking in. Restaurant and bars to explore and room service was also lovely. Outdoor terrace and high ceilings with the Biggy rooms on the ground floor which was great for breakfast in the mornings. Extra special touches for occasions such as birthdays could be improved upon, especially for those who don’t drink alcohol. Hopefully visit again this year :)\n",

      "  review_body : The rooms are great, the staff try hard, and the food is great! So what is the problem??Well, you need to be prepared to feel like a bystander in an all day night club/restaurant if you stay here. For that reason I would not describe it as a hotel. Guests have to struggle to get a table - there is no bar - just a lobby. The staff are terribly sweet and try hard but sadly they are not professionally trained which is bad for them and bad for the guests. If I were under 30 and wanted a cool location for brunch or to hang out this fits the bill. But if you want to stay at a hotel where you feel like a guest forget it.Other notes - air conditioning in the rooms is very poor - min temperature is 19.5 but in practice much higher. The service is appalling and the area where the hotel is located is not central and “up and coming” but not yet arrived. At €400 per night there is way better on offer in way better locations. \n",

The young trendy staff are friendly and fashionable but a bit on the vague side when it comes to service. The breakfast bag is very on trend - but let’s be truly honest who wants a granola pot and a banana in Paris? Bring back the croissants! All in all a great hotel - better enjoyed by the under 30s.\n",

The mini burgers they prepared were delicious and the staff made sure our glasses were full throughout the night with wine or champagne. The young man working the bar for us was great. Didn’t get his name but he’s early 20s, wears glasses, and knows his wine. Loved this place!\n",

A perfect alternative at a fraction of the cost is the Sofitel Faubourg. Location is perfect on Rue Faubourg St Honore at Hermes & the Police Checkpoint. Friendly staff, modern appointments with a \"fashion theme\" gives you an upbeat trendy environment - fresh and casually stylish. A great Sofitel located perfectly for the best stores and the close by the best hotels.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed at the Sofitel Paris le Faubourg at the beginning and end of our recent trip to France. It is a beautiful hotel, wonderfully located next to the Place de la Concorde and the fashionable shops. The Tuileries Garden are a stone's throw away. The hotel is boutique size, just right for individual service that was flawless. All of the staff was great, but a special mention to Daphne at the front desk and Jerome at the Concierge desk -- they gave us such special attention and went out of their way to make sure that we had a perfect visit. This will certainly be our go-to hotel from now on in Paris. We always stay at a Sofitel when we can. They never disappoint, and the Sofitel le Faubourg is no exception -- it is simply wonderful. The room was very comfortable, and the bed is like magic. Great place, wonderful service. Compliments to all the staff for making it such a special success.\n",

The staff did their utmost to ensure our happiness, offering us a larger room to accommodate our luggage, and champagne & cake on my wife’s birthday. They really care about their customers’ happiness & experience. Fabrinna & Tamara were born to be “Guest Relations” personnel, often quoting “if you’re happy, we’re happy”! The breakfast team were friendly & efficient, as were Laura at Reception, Thomas the Concierge & the Asian Doorman! Well done to all the hotel staff.The hotel could be improved by removing the bed topper (which is too soft and lumpy), and adjusting the shower head (which has weak flow and didn’t reach out far enough). The room, however, is stylish, chic and comfortable.\n",

      "  review_body : This is one of the worst \"prestigious\" hotels that i have ever stayed in. I had booked a 3 night stay in the prestige suite to spend my last leg of my France birthday trip, however what turned out to be in reality did not match up to the descriptions that was on the hotel website. The room was small and cramped; and felt like they had just turned a one standard bedroom and added in a small little living room. The site also stated that the prestige comes with a walk in wardrobe, bathtub & separate Hammam shower; and to my horror, it is a small little bathroom that looked exactly like what you would get in a standard one bedroom and a tiny little wardrobe. I had also other family members that were staying there at the same time and had booked the same room. When i had compared their rooms to mine, it looked utterly different! After expressing my displeasure to the guest relations, i was given a pile of excuses that the different suites are configured in different layouts, and that my other family members were given an upgrade. I had to pull out the site descriptions to show them what they had promised where not what was delivered and they only had to work through getting me an \"upgrade\" out of good will for my last night and giving me \"free breakfast\" (though i had expected that since you do not have a lounge, most 5 star hotels, especially Intercontinental Opera would provide breakfast for free to their suite customers) and a 200 euros off the whole stay. Not that i care that the free breakfast or free one night (pfft) upgrade - i could jolly well pay that on my own, however what throws me off is the full experience that i had to endure throughout the stay, made in China i could say. What you see online, is portrayed different in reality. Negative and claustrophobic to sum it up. Never again! This will be one and last time whenever i am back in Paris.\n",

One word of advice though—don’t book a ride to the airport through the hotel. They just call a regular taxi and it takes much longer to arrive. Better off calling an Uber and meeting them at the corner by Hermes. \n",

The location is excellent for touring the main sites of Paris with most within walking distance. The hotel is beautiful, beds super comfortable, service impeccable and rooms are quiet and clean. A big thank you to the front desk and Manager who couldn't have been more helpful with all our needs. We were in a Jr. Suite at the back of the hotel and couldn't have been happier. The breakfast buffet was delicious with abundant choices. When my wife and I first pulled up to the hotel we were a bit surprised by all the armed French Gendarmerie that guarded the street the hotel was located on but quickly learned that the American Embassy was located right up the street.

First I was going to Paris to visit a friend who was coming in for business and staying at the hotel. Unfortunately there was a Heath in the family and she had to cancel her trip and room. The hotel was aware of the situation when I spoke with them and tried to cancel my non refundable room reservation. Under the circumstances I would have expected some flexibility but the hotel would not allow me to cancel and was quite rude. My room was 600 euros so not a cheap room. I decide to go instead of wasting the money and enjoy Paris for the day. That evening when I returned to the hotel and went to have dinner I was informed that the restaurant was closed on weekends. The overall service and attitude from most of the staff was terrible. The hotel is not that nice and with all the choices in Paris don’t waste your time or money staying here. You can get much better service and hotel experience at a cheaper price.Very disappointed! \n",

For a start despite having our reservation changed to start a day early and having confirmation sent to our emails, we were told that we were not due to check in on the day. This took a while to sort out and then were told no early checkin. we were at the hotel at 12 noon. Having decided to eat at the restaurant which was indeed very good we were still told that the room will only be available at 15:00. The queue each time to speak to someone on reception was ridiculous to say the least.The rooms themselves are ok. We booked the Collection suite at quite a high day rate and I have to say the rooms do not look anything like they do in the picures. I have definitely stayed at better hotels for similar prices. There was a very nice gesture to leave us a bottle of champagne and flowers as it was our anniversary.The room itself was adequate till we found a large stain on teh carpet near the table. We stayed in room 138 if you really need to know. i would not expect this from a hotel that prides itself as first class.Apart from that the location was great and as central as you can get. But there are plenty more hotels very close to this location at similar rates. So would i stay again at the Sofitel le fauborg, I have to say no.\n",

We had a luxury room that should be 25 sqm and I do believe that the room I was given was way smaller. a lot of the room space was taken by the roof wall. There isn’t even space for a chair to set on. No room light, there was only a small window.We had breakfast included in our room. Tamara offered us excellent service, she was very lovely, welcoming, and helpful. Food variety is good but can be improved, it is disappointing to only have Scrambled eggs on the buffet and if the guest wants to order anything from the breakfast menu ( pancakes, waffles, any other type of egg) there will be a charge. For the room price I am paying and for a 5 star hotel, I expect this to be included. Concierge is okay. Both Antonio and Jerome are good but They do not bother going the extra mile to accommodate the guest requests. I requested multiple restaurants booking ( le grand vense, Café de l'Homme, Girafe) but I only got one in loulou. If the restaurant is difficult to find a table, they don’t bother trying to find.\n",

Ask for a room facing the street otherwise you'll face the courtyard with minimal natural light. The hotel is located on a pedestrian only street due to the US Embassy next door. There are gates and police at either end of the street, but it's not intrusive and they let taxi/shuttles, etc. down the street to the hotel.Hotel staff were personable and attentive. Breakfast was included in our Costco package and was very good--something for everyone. Hot and cold food, cheeses, breads--and a great selection of fruit, juices and yummy infused water. The room was very clean and in good condition. We had two sets of windows that opened to a little balcony. It was nice to get fresh air into the room. The flower display in the lobby is just really a beautiful things to see. When we arrived it was a red/orange theme. Next day we came back to find a brand new display in blues, pinks and green. Just such a lovely thing to see every day and such care is taken. I hope they never decide to do away with it!! Great location and I would stay here again.\n",

We arrived past 10am wet and looking not our best after lugging 6 suitcases. Upon check-in the guy receptionist said our room was being cleaned and that check-in was at 3pm. But for some reason a woman dressed in bling who checked in around the same time was given a room. Fine. When my husband followed up, a girl receptionist told him, you are 2nd priority. I kid you not!!! When i followed up with the guy receptionist, the woman interupted and told me that others had paid for their rooms the day before. To which i replied, that I had pre-paid for our room MONTHS before. By this time my 5 year old daughter was crying and my husband mad at me for not booking the ritz or Shang. Having stayed at various hotels around the world, this was the worst check-in I experienced. Admittedly I chose this hotel because of the good rate I had as an Accor member but I Honestly had better service at a Best Western hotel in my younger years.And to think Sofitel is supposedly a five star hotel!! While they gave rooms to other people, they made us and other guests wait until their 3pm check-in. I wonder what their basis is for giving out rooms... Oh and they did not clean our room for one whole day. We had to call for that service as well... What saved our stay was a nicely worded apology from the guest relations team and the excellent and fabulous services of Sofitel's doormen specially Andrew. The location of the hotel is also fantastic. Checkout was likewise a breeze as it was fast and efficient. We loved other aspects of our stay so please improve your check-in!\n",

      "  review_body : This review is long over due. We are a family of 4 (2 sons ages 10 and 8) from New York. We stayed at Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg (SPLF) a little more than a year ago. What a delightful little hotel. Perfectly situated in central Paris. Most tourist destinations are close and walkable. It's probably one of the safest hotels in Paris, as it is located close to US embassy and the street is closed for normal car traffic. From check in to check out, everything seemed seamless at SPLF. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Rooms are typically cozy but clean and comfortable. We absolutely loved our stay at SPLF. We look forward to returning to the hotel in the near future!\n",

      "  review_body : Maybe its just me and my high expectations but when we changed our recent stay in Paris to 8 nights in one hotel rather than a shorter Paris stay and a side trip to Bruges, I took advantage of a good rate on Accor hotels via their app and call centre. Arriving in to Paris at 11.30pm and having registered online we expected to be in our room within a few minutes having only to pick up a key at reception.What felt like half an hour later (and this may be a small exaggeration due to the fatigue of having flown from Cape Town to Zurich and on to Paris leaving very early that morning) we finally went upstairs to our room. We have visited Paris many times over the past 30 years and I have to say this was the smallest room I have had in a luxury hotel ever! We are both platinum members of club Accor which the receptionist had not seen on my booking (which normally all but guarantees us an upgrade). I appreciate the fact that just like if you want to fly business class you need to book a business class ticket and not hope for an upgrade, same goes for hotels - if you want a decent room book a decent room so this may be entirely my own fault. It appears that despite having booked via their own online app with my platinum status loyalty number the hotel had an alternate number on file for me which showed me with no status which appears to have been the reason for the \"no upgrade- you get what you booked\" teeny room. The next morning we approached the manager who was wonderful and sympathetic and promised to move us to the one category higher as soon as they were able to which was not until our fifth night in the hotel. Melissa deserves a very special mention for her ability to deal with people in a most friendly and wonderful way. To be fair we did not spend much time in the room because this is Paris in the spring after all but the room in no way made us want to spend much time in it. It had room for a bed and a small table with one chair. Having been travelling for a month and bringing back all sorts of goodies from Cape Town, our suitcases hardly fit in and we had no room to move. The lighting system must have been designed by a sadist as every time one turned on one light they all turned on including spot lights over the bed, and trying to get a light in the bathroom was almost impossible. The amenities at Sofitel are always nice with Hermes bath products and nice robes but our cleaning person clearly did not think that we should have milk in our morning coffee and despite a few hints it never turned up. French hotels also have no ice machines which is a bit strange for those of us who live in N. America and can always find one on each floor. Melissa the manager did send up champagne and there were as usual some nice little Sofitel \"cadeau\" including easter chocolates which were appreciated. All Sofitel staff are exceptionally well trained and endlessly polite all the way from the lovely lady who served us dinner and chatted away with my daughter in French, to the reception staff especially Pierre who made sure we were happy in our room . The flowers in the lobby deserve a special mention and are truly beautiful. Now on to why not to travel to Paris for Easter. The hotel was FULL and I truly mean full of children- poorly behaved ones mostly whose parents clearly felt that their little precious ones should stand on chairs and wave forks around at the table and run wild. There were mornings that felt like we were on holiday at a resort in the Dominican Republic (without the rum and merengue dancing). The dining room is very crowded with chairs and it is hard to find anywhere to sit where there is any privacy and one is not cheek by jowl with your neighbours. The breakfast fare is also very tedious. Nothing changed in eight mornings. By our last morning we had our daughter deliver us pain aux almonde to provide some relief for the tedium. The offerings were the usual with nothing special, a bit of an Asian spread for the many Asian guests, cold hard cheese (yes in Paris, at a French hotel, the cheese was kept in a refrigerated glass case and not varied in all the time we were there- tasteless brie and a bland hard Comte), a small buffet of hot food and a limited array of fruit and yogurt, a bread table and then some sugary treats for the children so that they could fuel up for the day and no doubt make their parents wish the holidays were over. When we were moved to our much nicer room facing the street side, looking onto the Buddha bar, we were much happier and managed to have a few fun evenings of pre-dinner champagne and cheese with our daughter who is resident in Paris as we had a real table, couch and chair. The location is wonderful, a few minutes from Concorde, just off Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré so very safe and central. Perfect for exploring, shopping and walking. We walked between 25 and 30,000 steps per day in Paris and took only a few metros. Gallerie Lafayette is a short walk away and of course the choice of restaurants nearby is overwhelming. Be aware on this street that Ubers need permission to drive to the hotel as there is security and the street is closed to car traffic which may be a bit of an issue when calling an uber. Arrange to meet on Rue du Faubourg, a one minute walk. Would I stay at the hotel again? Likely not, there are so many choices in Paris and probably for a stay over a couple of nights we would choose an apartment over a hotel. The apartment that we have stayed in for years, on Rue San Andres Des Artes, has been taken off short stay websites due to changes in regulations to try to ease the rental situation in Paris but we may well look for another one in time. Hotels are ideal for two to three nights but any hotel becomes a bit tedious after a while. Unless one can live like Philip Weber, the man who lived at the Ritz, no hotel is ideal for longer. The fact that the hotel has very little in the way of a view is an issue for me- the hotel that we stayed in last summer was the St James Albany where we had a view of the whole of Paris above the Tuilleries was very special so this would factor into a decision as to where to stay. What I will avoid in future is travelling to Paris during Easter when it seems that many families take holidays. I have four children of my own, mostly grown up, and have travelled to many parts of the world with them but to stick kids in a luxury hotel is not fun for other guests and I will bet not nearly as much fun for the kids as going to a really great resort in the Dominican Republic, drinking rum and letting the kids run wild on the beach!\n",

We're glad we did.It's a remarkably comfortable and intimate (for its size) hotel. The rooms are of a good size and very comfortable, clean, and well maintained. We stayed in one of the \"Collection\" suites (really a junior suite) and enjoyed it. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom with a walk-in shower AND a tub was great.. Room servicing was efficient and well done.In general, all the staff were well trained and helpful.If your room includes the breakfast - fine ... nothing remarkable ... the usual choices. If not, you're better off wandering over to a local cafe' for a tartine and coffee.The bar - by the way - is great.\n",

      "  review_body : Many hotels offer the same things: bedroom, bathroom, fitness center, etc. But few hotels actually think about the small touches that elevate a stay from fine to superb. This is one of those hotels. Check in was wonderful: thank you Fabrice (I hope I spelled your name correctly) for your warm and gracious welcome. Also thanks to the Concierge who helpfully obtained dinner reservations for us. Everyone working in the hotel was dedicated to making you feel welcome and cared for. I appreciated the doormen who greeted us and helped us get a taxi when it was time to leave (thank you!!) and the servers in the breakfast room who truly worked hard to make a fantastic breakfast meal. Also the housekeeping was fabulous - our room was always pristine when we returned from our sightseeing and museum hopping.Stayed in a Collection Suite. Interesting layout - very elongated with sitting room leading to bedroom leading to bathroom. The windows opened onto the courtyard. It was very quiet and peaceful, I didn't hear any noise at all. The beds were indeed outstanding - very comfortable mattresses and bedding, and this is the first hotel I have stayed in that provided a proper memory foam pillow upon request - so comfortable!!! We had a safe and plenty of closet space. I liked having two separate sinks in the bathroom along with a walk in rainforest shower. They provided a loofah as well as comb, q tips and other amenities. Another nice touch: moist towelettes next to the toilet. They made sure we had bottled water and slippers next to the beds. And the Hermes products were really great!The fitness center was small but did have one upright bike and the usual treadmill, stepper and weights. The equipment was in excellent conditions. Another unexpected nice touch: there were wrapped lightly scented moist towels/washcloths available to clean off after your workout, individually wrapped and waiting on a table next to the towels, water and fruit. They did have steam rooms available. Breakfast was included in our room rate and it is well worth it. The quality of the food as well as service was exceptional. The baked goods were divine (I'm not sure you can get a bad baked good in Paris although perhaps it is possible) - croissants, pain au chocolate etc. Scrambled eggs, Earl Grey eggs (essentially hard boiled eggs that I assume were boiled in Earl Grey tea), asian noodles, meats, cheeses, muesli/cereals, yogurts, rice pudding, fresh fruit, tea, coffee etc. You name it, they have it. And it all tastes great! Definitely a cut above the usual hotel breakfast buffet. Plus, plenty of newspapers to peruse while eating - including ones in English.Location cannot be better if you are interested in the major tourist sites like the museums and monuments. This is a very centrally located hotel. The surrounding area is full of high priced shops so if you are a shopaholic better bring plenty of Euros!Overall an outstanding stay in a hotel that puts a lot of thought into guest comfort including the small things that other hotels overlook. It was well worth the price and I can't wait to return to the beautiful city of Paris and stay again at Sofitel Le Faubourg.\n",

Chose the hotel for its location just off Rue St Honore and Place de La Concorde. Could not have been more central for the protests and in the middle of the tight police cordons. The hotel staff were very honest about the situation and did everything they could to advise us and help during the weekend. They even provided someone to wait at the police cordon and guide us back to the hotel safely during the tense situation on the Saturday. The hotel is very secure anyway with guards for the American Embassy on the cornerWe had booked a superior suite that was very comfortable,with lovely furnishings and the hotel though not large has lovely decor's. The bar is small but the staff there and at reception were very friendly. We did not eat dinner at the hotel but the concierge gave some excellent advice on local restaraunts. Breakfasts were delicious with plenty of choice.Will definately return but not when Paris is in riot mode.\n",

Super safe!Conceirge is great. With lots of helpful advice on ensuring a safe and hassle free visit to the Strasbourg Christmas markets after the recent terrorist incident... again reflecting the great service offered by the hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : I my wife and I checked into the Sofitel de Fauberg for what we thought was going to be 6 wonderful nights in Paris. The hotel, the staff, the room were exceptional and exceeded our expectations. However a day after our arrival my wife was taken at a nearby restaurant, and was ultimately taken to a local hospital where she stayed overnight. Given my limited fluency with French I really needed the help of the hotel staff in terms of communication with the hospital, securing prescriptions, etc. All I can say is they were to a one phenomenal. They all went over and above with their care and attention. Clearly making what was a stressful situation very manageable. To the hotel management please convey our deepest appreciation\n",

But most shockingly everything is packed in plastic. I add a photo to see how much plastic waste I produced with just one person: cheese butter sugar tea bag etc... all packed in single portions. And the shower towels are too small. This is 19th century Hotellerie. Sustainability is key! Overall disappointed although location is perfect love the concept and rooms and service at reception wonderful.\n",

The hotel is really cute: it's centered around music, and all the rooms are tastefully decorated following this theme without going overboard. The rooms are quite small (but it's the norm in Paris) clean, and comfortable. The location is really what makes this hotel stand out. There are grocery stores, stores (Zara, Massimo Dutti etc.), restaurants, bakeries and bars in the same block. Galeries Lafayette, le Printemps, and l'Opéra de Paris are within walking distance. The area is really safe, and fun. I have to mention the \"adult\" shops: some of the rooms have a view on them. It wasn't a problem for us, there was nothing shocking, however, you might want to think about it if you're traveling with kids.I stayed in Paris many times and this hotel is by far the best I've ever been to. It's not luxurious, but has a lot of charm. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.\n",

I clearly asked a room for me, my wife and my daughter, 9yo. I payed with credit card to Amoma, and in the voucher was written \"double bed room, 2 adult and a child\". At my arrival the room was prepared with a double bed and a single bed. I had a nice staying in the hotel , but at the moment of checking out they asked me 160€ extra for the bed of my daughter, despite in the page of the hotel is written in the italian version \"lettino per bambino gratuito\" (child bed complimentary).Both the hotel and Amoma say that it's an extra request, so I have to pay. I think that they took advantage of it, playing with the words of the \"terms and conditions\", on the bad translation between child and infant.First and last experience with Amoma, if I have to go back to Paris I will still choose another hotel, as they have not even answered my requests for clarification\n",

First and the most important thing about the hotel is that the staff were always helpful and nice. Thanks again for their awesome service. Location of the hotel was really great and it was exceedingly sufficient for our trip plans. There are nearby metro & train stations and shops. Madeleine metro station is only 100 meters away. The room was very clean and stylish. It was also surprisingly spacious considering it is a Paris hotel. Bed was comfortable even if pillows are a little bit small. Bathroom was very clean, also. We would love to stay again in Hôtel du Triangle d'Or for another Paris trip. Overall the hotel is definitely worth the price.\n",

      "  review_body : I went to Paris with my adult daughter for our birthdays and really loved this friendly hotel. We felt comfortable straight away, the staff spoke great English and were very helpful and polite. The music themed hotel had a different artist theme on each of the floors, ours was a drummer so the room was ingeniously furnished in a drum theme. We didn't spend much time in the hotel but I know there was breakfast available and a bar area. It was a 5 minute walk from a metro station and 10 minutes from the main shops (Pretemps etc) I am thinking of returning soon to Paris and will definitely go back to that hotel. \n",

Rooms are cozy, the Deluxe ones are spacious....Prices are reasonable for quality offered. It does not have a restaurant but there are many places to eat nearby (Fauchon for instance is around the corner for some luxurious snacks or all kind of small restaurants or Hotel Coste restaurant for fancy dinners is at a walking distance!

      "  review_body : Hotel location is great, within 5 mins walk to Madeleine Metro station. Chic & stylish hotel, room spacious as compared to normal Paris 3 stars hotel though bathroom is a bit compact. Bed is comfortable, quiet room. I didn't take breakfast, so no comments. Wifi speed acceptable but couldn't connect sometimes, need to wait for a bit longer loading a page.I don't mean to give a poor comment but unfortunately I had a bad experience upon arrival. The lady in grey hair & glasses was not welcoming at all when I arrived in early morning. She was nice with other guests speaking French, maybe because I'm an Asian girl. Since my long haul flight landed Paris at 6am, I can't help but had arrived at 8:30am at hotel, maybe this upset the receptionist. She repeated & emphasized not able to offer early check in because hotel was full, guests have not yet checked out, which I fully understand as a frequent traveler. I've just want to store my luggage, then I'll start my city walk in Paris without difficulty. She even shouted to me for closing the hotel door, because it was freezing. However, I was not the one who left the door opened, just because I was standing near the doorway, waiting to drop my luggage, should I deserve such a bad manner? I helped closing the door but the receptionist didn't even say a Thank you.Of course, other hotel staffs are charming & welcoming. Just to let the hotel know that one problematic staff could bring down service level of the hotel.I'll not come back to Hotel du Triangle d'Or next time in Paris. Thank you!\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed at the Triangle for 5 nights in Sep-Oct 2016.The location of the hotel is great; easy access to metro, short walk from major shopping destinations and major tourist attractions in Paris. The property itself was very nicely designed (lots of money went into that, and it shows), and although it could use a few maintenance touch-ups it's in very good condition. Rooms are spotlessly clean, and (even the cheapest) are big enough to comfortably fit two adults and two constantly-open-on-the-floor suitcases easily.The staff is extremely helpful, all speak perfect English, and are more than happy to assist, with any inquiry or concern.Our particular room (and I suspect several others, too) suffer from one significant problem - they are extremely noisy. We were on the 1st floor (right above the entrance), and every car passing on the street, as well as every 4AM drunkard, was easily heard as if they were on the other side of our door.Because the room entrances are right next to eachother, you can also hear each time one of your neighbors loudly enters or exits their room with a slam of the door.Finally, the hotels lights, lighting the facade of the building were right outside our window; the curtains were really good at making the room dark, but at their ends you could still see the strong light outside.If you manage to get a rear-facing room (or one on a high floor), away from the elevators, it's probably a perfect hotel. For us it was just Good.\n",

Hotel has an elevator. I had a room on the top floor. Even though it was very hot in Paris,AC worked wonders.My room was super cute from a design point of view. I had a small balcony and windows overlooking tout Paris. Slept well as it was very quiet and dark.Bathroom was small but clean and all necessary provided.Overall I felt the room was fairly big for Paris central location and actually good value for money. Breakfast was at extra cost and ok. I have not tried the Spa area.Will definitely stay here again and would also recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stylish central stay in Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : First stayed here for 8 nights in June 2014 - 3 families (5 adults and 2 children) in 3 rooms (2 delux and 1 superior rooms). Good experience in 2014 that so we (2 adults) stayed here again for 7 nights in May 2016. In 2016, we stayed in Room 54, a superior room on the 5th floor. In 2014, we stayed in a delux room on the 6th (top) floor. The delux room is larger than the standard of course but the there is no bathtub in the delux room that we stayed in. We asked for a room on a higher floor, away from the elevator and that's what we got both times. To my surprise, things haven't changed much (in a good way) in the 2 years in terms of the conditions of carpets, common areas, stairs, room furnishing, breakfast, etc... The air-conditioning remained very good in that it cools down the room really fast and so great during a hot day. As everyone noted, the location couldn't be better. 1-minute walk to the Madeleine Metro station. If you need an EU simm card, there is an Orange store about 1-minute away. 2-minute walk to the Monop grocery store on Boulevard de la Madeleine, where we stocked up on water to bring to the hotel. There is another smaller grocery store on the same block of Rue Godot de Mauroy, across from the hotel. If you are renting a car, there is an Avis rental office (pick-up and drop-off) 2-minutes away. 5-minute walk to the department stores on Boulevard Haussmann. 5-minute walk to the Roissy (to CDG airport) bus stop near Opera Garnier. 7-minute walk to Jardin des Tuileries. The main Fauchon store (with restaurant upstairs) at Madeleine is now closed. Otherwise, the immediate surrounding businesses haven't changed much. Not much of a front desk reception area. If you arrive early, they can store your luggage in a locked room – yes, they tagged each luggage piece. The small elevator can fit 2 large luggage and 2 adults. Walking up/down stairs makes for good exercise in the morning. They use e-cards to open room doors - in 2016, the room # is identified on the card but there is no other identifying mark on the card so that's good. Note that there may be a couple of persons sleeping on the streets around the area (especially at night), but not in the immediate vicinity of the hotel - they haven't bothered us the many times that we walked past them.We always booked the room with the breakfast. The breakfast room has about 10 small tables. There is always an attendant on duty when they are open for breakfast. Limited hot items include sausage. Also available are juices, milk, tea/coffee (which you have to ask the attendant), croissants, bread, yogurt, milk, pound cake, jams, hard-boiled eggs, cereals, pastries, cheeses, ham slices, etc... In 2014, they had the box of tea bags out in the open but in 2016, the box is with the attendant so you have to ask for it - I guess people have been taking the tea bags away as freebies.I know, you think online prices are the same on different sites but that's not really true. Always look for the breakfast included deals. You might want to call the hotel directly or private-message them to see if they can give you a better deal. In 2016, I definitely felt there were less tourists around than in 2014 so there may be some give in pricing - never hurts to try.The room (Room 54) is clean and bright when the curtains are open. Some traffic noises even with the windows closed but they are not noticeable if you have the air-conditioning on. The closet is huge and that's where the safe and small fridge are. The safe stopped working (battery exhausted) on the second day and we notified the front desk in the morning and that was promptly fixed the same day. The beds/pillows are comfortable enough. Bring your own slippers. The bathroom is clean. Hot running water good with no problems. Chambermaids (and there were many) were efficient in getting rooms cleaned daily but they do leave stuffs (vacuum hoses, dirty linens) lying around the hallways so you may notice the clutter if you go out and come back to the hotel several times each day. Two minor complaints that we have are: (i) the rooms (2014/2016) have too many cushions and no place to put them when we are not using them, which is most of the time; and (ii) the plastic bag in the bathroom garbage can is way too small to fit the can’s rim properly so it comes off the rim constantly.No problems with the free WiFi in 2016 or 2014.Because of Uber, the taxi service in Paris is now more efficient in 2016. You can even book online - especially good if you are going to the airport early in the morning. If you need a van, they will ask for a credit card online because there is a surcharge for vans which had to be paid (€5) at the time of booking.We would definitely stay at Triangle D’Or again.\n",

There is absolutely no where to put your clothes ( there used to be a bench at the end of the bed where you could stack clothing- not anymore!).The renovation of the lobby is beautiful.The front desk was very friendly except for one women - short hair and glasses - who shouldn’t be in the hospitality industry because she is not service oriented. Example: on our third day there breakfast, which we paid extra for was a disappointing. There was not enough food on display, servers were new and just came out to move an empty platter to a new location. When we complained and said that we would not like to pay for the breakfast on this day, and the next 2 days, she gave us a really hard time.We will be staying elsewhere on our next visit to Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : Our group of 2 couples recently stayed at Le Six for 4 nights. We had booked Superior class rooms. We chose Le Six after a long internet search and upon reading the reviews on TA. We were so very glad we chose Le Six!Our room was nicely laid out with a short hallway at the entrance which housed a good sized closet (plenty of hanging space and shelves). There was more storage in a wall unit which held the Nespresso machine. The room itself was not large but a pretty good size by Paris standards. Plenty of outlets and USB ports. The bathroom was small but had a large walk in shower, which worked great. The breakfast room was small but well staffed and the buffet provided everything anyone could want.The staff was very friendly and eager to help. There was a public transit strike the day we were to leave Paris so the staff arranged for a private car to take us to our train station as they knew we would never get a taxi. We also enjoyed discussions with the gentleman manning reception at night. He gave us good suggestions for dinner in the neighborhood. BTW there are 2 small local restaurants with very good food on Rue Stanislas (same owner who was super friendly and helpful) and many more around the corner on Rue Montparnesse. There are Metro stops nearby and several attractions within walking distance.Le Six provides a solid 4 star experience at prices below those hotels closer to the Seine. We will definitely return to this hotel on our next Paris trip.\n",

The room was supplied with a Nespresso machine, a tea kettle, bath robes and slippers, bottled water every day, a clean large bathtub if you prefer a bath vs a shower, L’Occitane toiletries, and complimentary chocolate upon arrival. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the balcony at night and making short trips to a natural food market as well as a pharmacy for some top notch beauty products.

But what it lacked in walking room, it made up for in comfort and style. The luxurious and comfortable beds were much needed for our tired, jet lagged bodies, especially after a day of sightseeing. The bathroom was spacious and serene. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and the lounge in the lobby was a stylish oasis and the perfect spot to relax before heading out for the day. The hotel location is also perfect for exploring Paris, between two Metro lines and amidst dozens of great restaurants. I highly recommend a nearby creperie called Le Petit Josselin. Overall, a great experience and I would definitely return.\n",

They were helpful in making dinner reservations and seeing if I needed any taxi services. The level of customer service was well above most hotels and it has convinced me to return to Paris sooner than I had planned. When I return, I will be staying with Hotel Le Six. The location can't be beat as far as I'm concerned...I like the quiet street where it is located. The rooms are well appointed, nothing left to be desired. The air conditioning was such a relief when we arrived after a heat wave in France and traveling through areas that didn't have much in the way of AC. Did I mention the shower?? OMG, it is terrific! They also have a Nespresso in the room that was well used while I was there. One morning while there I had breakfast and it was very good. I don't know how many people in the hotel eat breakfast there as I was the only one in the dining area at the time, but there was a good variety of food and all was delicious. The only thing I will do differently next time I go is request a larger room. I had a superior room (mid size) and would spring for a little more space...and a bath tub. I was wanted to soak in a tub a couple of nights after long days of walking. Overall, the stay was fantastic, and I'm looking forward to another trip soon.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed in Hotel Le Six for 6 nights. My agent had made the booking for us and breakfast was included. Our total stay was good, we had good clean rooms, the size of the rooms was good, and the breakfast was also nice, the staff was friendly and helpful. The last night when I needed to checkout at 4 am in the morning I approached the reception asking for settlement of a security deposit that was charged on my card the day I checked in and at that time was told that this is just a security and will be refunded when i check out. I was told by the ladies sitting at the reception that I will get it tomorrow morning when I check out. I agreed and went to my room. That night around 10 pm when I returned to the hotel after dinner the desk was occupied by a man, who looked quite unpleasant in his behaviour which I ignored. I asked him for a bottle of water in my room and he said he was not my servant and that I should take the bottle at the desk itself, I did that and left just thinking it was just a bad mood syndrome. The next morning at around 4 I went to the desk and asked the gentleman about my security deposit. He looked quite upset and started pacing the lobby and going out the door to get some fresh air. I asked him if he was sleepy and he nodded his head. After waiting for a moment or two a little disturbed by his behaviour I asked him to switch on the lights of the lobby and he just started shouting at me saying he will not. I was honestly taken aback and my little girl was frightened. He started shouting at me saying racist comments. He admitted that he doesnt work for the Hotel and he works for a security company, and he doenst care what I felt or thought about the Hotel. It was the worst 15 minutes of my whole trip and my daughter and myself were so shocked and were relieved only when the cab pickup driver came in. The guy even said quite a few things about us to the taxi guy which were in French and all I could make out was that he was saying rude remarks. It is very unprofessional of the Hotel to leave the desk to somebody outside of the Hotel who didnt care how the guest felt like. When I said to the guy that I need to talk to someone from the hotel he just said he didnt care what I felt like, and also asked me to go ahead and call the Police.In the morning from the airport around 7am I called up the hotel again to talk to the receptionist. I told her everything and she said that the money will be refunded to me only later. I asked her I am a tourist and how does she except me to be refunded that money. Secondly she also told me that I have an outstanding of 6 mornings of breakfast. I told her that is not right coz my booking includes breakfast and even if that was the case why was I not told that yesterday night when I came to the reception. I asked her do you wait for clients to checkout of the hotel and then inform all this. I am shocked at the unprofessional behaviour of this hotel, notwithstanding to mentioning the fact that me and my daughter were made to wait 20 minutes for the spa despite making the booking long before. I had a dinner reservation but my daughter really wanted to do it so I agreed to wait. My experience speaks a lot for itself and I have nothing more to say.\n",

Situated on a darling side street, super close to the hustle of a main drag with countless restaurants, bars, stores access to transport. Super clean rooms, get one with a balcony and/or opening windows. Helpful staff organized our entrance to tourist attractions, must easier than queuing up for tickets for the Louvre, Museo d'Orsay, etc. Will stay again.\n",

I would highly recommend it.We had a small billing issue that occurred upon check out that I didn't notice until after we had departed. The General Manager Angela was on it once she was made aware of it.  She persevered until it was fixed. She actually called me on the telephone to resolve the issue. Her follow up went beyond anything I've ever seen. I know things can sometime go wrong, that is expected. It's how it is handled and resolved that makes the difference.

      "  review_body : If you are a couple visting Paris, this is definitely a place to consider booking. Boutique 4 star hotel that will offer a good night's sleep and a nutrious breakfast before you put on our Vibram sole shoes to rack up another 10 km until lunch. Helpful staff that provides useful information.Hotel: Great location on a quiet street with several Metro stops literally just around the corner. Easy access via Metro and busses to all sights and to main train stations like Gare de Lyon or Gare de l'Est. Bakeries, restaurants and mini-marts within walking distance. The Louvre and Notre Dame are a nice 30 min walk away. Rooms: Reasonably priced and reasonably sized by Paris standards. Our Superior Room had the right size for three nights. Clean, quiet and good mattresses. Bonus points for UK and US power outlets above the desk. We missed a coat rack and a second chair, everything else was fine. If you plan to work hard during your stay, you might find the desk a bit small. The hotel is located in an old building, so if you're handicapped this might not be the perfect choice for you.Service: Attentive, helpful and friendly. All staff members we encountered spoke English well but were patient enough to endure my highschool French. Some are more familiar with the vicinity than others, but all tried to come up with answers to our questions.Breakfast buffet: Nice selection that offered enough variety for us on three mornings. High quality products such as yogurt from Normandy, fresh fruits and jambon cru. Also cereals, eggs plus bacon and - of course - croissants. Freshly made pancakes and waffles were kept at room temperature; I prefer them a tad warmer. The hotel's website offered a discount and with 15 €/person you cannot go wrong.\n",

Our suite was clean and comfortable. The staff was so friendly and helpful. My one regret is that we didn't try the breakfast at the hotel while we were there. Next time! I am already dreaming of our next trip to Paris. Without a doubt we will choose the Hotel Le Six for our stay!The only problem we had is with the exercise room. My daughter runs track for her college, so she tried to use the treadmill, but it didn't seem to work properly. We just adjusted our schedule so that she could run outdoors in the Jardin de Luxembourg instead.\n",

The size of some rooms is too small for the price of 350 euros. The rooms with balcony looking towards the road are the best.The breakfast is one of the best part of the journey in the hotel. Good and healthy quality of products, very good service, and always available to treat you with your preferences and prepapre a hot plate with nice omeletes and scramble eggs.The entrance, for an hotel in Paris, is of a good size and has some nice corners to relax with a tea or a glass of wine.Well located, on a very French cultural Historic centers, sounrounded by the best brasseries of Paris, close to parc de Luxemberg and quartier latin, and at the same time qiet.

Well, other than the price perhaps. It is definitely in the category of luxury hotel and you will pay for that luxury, but boy was it worth it! I have stayed in some real dumps in Paris for close to this much money and so it was a really nice change to get what you paid for. The hotel is in a nice street nestled between Blvd Raspail and Blvd Montparnasse. There are lots of cafes and bistros, shops and brasseries close by and the hotel recommendations were really excellent. The hotel itself feels modern and nicely designed. I stayed in a deluxe room on the fourth floor looking in on the courtyard. I heard very little noise. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom had a very nice bathtub which I used every night. The windows opened up to let in air. There was no kettle for making tea which was too bad but otherwise, I can only sing the praises of this fantastic hotel. The staff were always friendly and let me check in early. If you have breakfast, you will be overcharged but will eat well. Hotel Le Six, c'etait un hotel extraordinaire. Merci, je reviendrai.\n",

First, the hotel is beautiful; from entering, I loved the collection of books everywhere around the hotel. The atmosphere is comforting; the lighting is dim and intimate. Breakfast served every morning, it was always fresh, delightful, and you have many options. The room was clean orderly, the bathrooms are modern and gorgeous. The bed itself was the most comfortable bed I have had at any hotel. The staff made my stay that much more awesome. Mimi and Youseff really brought the experience to life. Mimi especially was very helpful and friendly. She took her time to help me navigate Paris ad also suggested many cool spots that were walking distance. She was personable and patient, I would go back just to visit her!Youssef was very welcoming, the staff adds to this entire experience!\n",

The hotel is very well located - about 2 mins walk from the nearest metro (Quatre Septembre) or 5-7 mins from Opera (with more connections). The Roissybus from CDG also stops near Opera (12 euros pp). The hotel has a very boutique feel with funky decorative touches. Our superior room was very nice with thoughtful touches such as a Nespresso machine and minibar/fridge. High quality linens on the bed and nice soft towels. Breakfast was good - warm croissants/pain au chocolat kept being brought out fresh and tea/coffee was made to order. A further lovely touch was a free afternoon tea between 4-6 daily - great for a cup of tea and slice of cake after a hard day of sightseeing. The staff throughout were also really genuine and helpful. I didn't feel well on our last day and they were very accommodating.\n",

The staff we met were amazing at reception with Yusef, Mimi, Melissa and the hotel manageress Inga, It was nice having some friendly banter with them, they seemed to know the answer to every question you ask them !!The rooms are fairly spacious for a city centre hotel and I loved having a bath rather than just a shower in my twin room. The easter chocolates on the bed were a lovely treat. My partner had his 50th whilst there and I phoned asking for a birthday cake. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff here and we had a beautiful chocolate cake which we enjoyed . We were also given a champagne bottle which was a really nice surprise. The pool is lovely if you have children, my 7 year old really enjoyed it, There is also a fridge with the mini bar but really handy if you want to put milk etc in for the little ones. Theres also a kettle in the room. Also very handy were the 2 supermarkets 2 minutes away. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it.\n",

We didn’t have time to visit the pool area so can’t comment however the rest of the hotel was clean and tidy.The only draw back I can think of is that there was no bar in the hotel however there was a mini bar in the room so this was not an issue for us.Overall I would highly recommend and would stay here again.\n",

Pleasant, but busy lobby. Tea and coffee making equipment in the rooms and also in the lobby.Cons: Very noisy at night due to busy neighborhood. The streets are narrow, with tiny sidewalks, so walking around in a group means lots of single file and dodging others. The pool was overheated, almost to jacuzzi levels. The gym equipment consisted of one treadmill, one stationary bike and one elliptical trainer, all in poor maintenance. The equipment room is near the pool and was also overheated and smelled very strongly of pool chemicals. Our bed was very soft.\n",

      "  review_body : I’m going to start this review with the best-possible compliment I have ever extended to a hotel: the comfort and the quality of the bed in room 408 was beyond amazing. I have never slept in a bed that comfortable in my entire life. It was like sleeping on a cloud. The room faces a quiet side street, and is located near a small park – if you value a good nights’ rest, then this hotel is for you. No door slamming, no annoying elevator \"ding\" sounds, just blissful and absolute peace and quiet - all night long.The hotel is within walking distance of Notre Dame (just a bit of a hike, but doable), the Louvre, the opera, Galerie Lafayette (major shopping mall), and Parlais Royale, and there are several metro stations nearby. The afternoon tea was a nice touch, but frankly, a wine/cheese reception would have been even better (after all, it’s Paris!). I'm a single/female traveler, and I find it easier to start a conversation with fellow guests over glass of wine or champagne than a cup of tea. Breakfast was lovely (with grapefruit and orange juice, fresh croissants, baguette, salami, cheeses, and salmon, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc.) and delicious coffee. I was told that it was not included in the package I booked (via Travelocity), but fortunately I had a printout of the confirmation with me that clearly stated that it was included, which eliminated any further confusion. The reception staff was extremely helpful with providing directions and tips for shopping and restaurants. I do, however, have one recommendation: If you want to book tickets for museums and/or attractions, book them using the computer located in the business center, and send your confirmation to the reception so they can print it out for you. If you have them make the reservation, it's done through a 3rd party vendor and you will be charged extra. I used the pool a few times and it was very pleasant. There is a small gym, but I never saw it being utilized by any of the guests. And as someone else already mentioned, a roof-top terrace would be an excellent addition to this hotel. I will most certainly return and would like to thank the entire staff for their excellent service and warm welcome.\n",

      "  review_body : My review is only based on the booking process. I went online to book with Hotel Square Louvois for October 2019. Since the trip was more than 6 months out, I made sure to select a rate that WAS NOT prepaid. It was clearly stated that I could cancel the reservation prior to the trip and I would only be charged on arrival. Two days later, I noticed that my credit card was charged for the entire trip. I emailed to clarify the rate and explained that I shouldn’t have been charge. The hotel responded and apologized, but proceeded to state that they would refund me if I decided to cancel the reservation. I then had to explain that I choose that rate for a reason and did not want to prepay for the hotel so far in advance of my trip. The hotel refunded me, but I still had almost $8 on my credit card that was unaccounted for. After speaking with the hotel again, I had to file a dispute with my credit card company. It was quickly resolved, but the entire experience was inconvenient. I ultimately cancelled due to the location of the hotel, but Hotel Square Louvois seems to be really helpful to guests. Upon booking, they provided information to assist with trip planning and also offered to make dinner/show reservations for me locally.\n",

The room was well appointed, comfortable, quiet, and had two full bathrooms! The staff greeted us with a surprise bottle of champagne and chocolates. We returned to our rooms the second night with chocolates on our bed. The rooms are super clean and comfortable. The pool area is a must see. We enjoyed relaxing in the warm pool each evening after touring. Our children were welcomed and enjoyed the pool and their own sleeping quarters on the second floor of the duplex suite. The area around the hotel has many Asian restaurants, but is a short walk to a main shopping district and the Opera as well as a 10 minute walk to the Louvre. Centrally located, the hotel is in an authentically Parisian location. We loved every aspect of our stay and would recommend it to anyone. Certainly 4 stars ++.\n",

Great location being central to most of Paris and within walking distance of most main areas (if you like walking, as Paris is rather larger than expected). Quite close to the Opera which was the main route in by bus from Charles De Gaulle airport. I was better than taking an cab and fairly comfortable. The rooms in most Parisian Hotels are small. But we were upgraded and had a comfortable Superior size room. Tea, Coffee (Nespresso Machine) and mini bar as standard. We did not have the breakfast as we were to busy getting around to see the sites. We did return for Tea one day, served around 4pm which was free with drinks (no alcohol) and cake. They also provided some popular games like chess, draughts and the like. It was well received by us. The staff could not have been more helpful, suggesting places and arranging cabs and giving directions. Small maps are available at reception. The only drawback came when we wanted to print our boarding cards and had no direct access to a printer. It was resolved by one of the staff using their personal email account to send files to the office printer. If we had to return to Paris we would definitely consider staying here and will be happily recommending it. The staff were fantastic.\n",

Ideal both for exploring the center of Paris or more distant places because Opera Metro links you to all transportation. Our room was large. very clean and completely quiet even with the window open.

      "  review_body : We just got back from our first trip to Paris. This hotel was an awesome find. The reviews are true. We are a family of five (three older teens). We had a family suite which sleeps five. It is two rooms at the end of the hall that they can make into a suite by closing a door in the hallway. So simple. More hotels should do this. The kids room had the king made into two twin beds and the day bed was actually a full size twin. Our room was smaller but with a king. The rooms were bigger than I thought they would be. The rooms are really done up well but also very functional.The bathrooms were a good size and quite nicely done up. The kids shower did allow water onto the floor which was easy to clean up. Our bathroom had a soaker tub shower so no water on the foor. Bathrobes and slippers for everyone.The hotel surprised us with a welcome bottle of wine! We never made it to the pool. The hotel is in a great location. Easy to walk to the Louvre and more. Crepe stands near the Louvre! There is a small grocery store near by we were directed to. The front desk was very helpful. Everyone spoke English and were very friendly. We did not have the breakfast included in our stay. We did enjoy the sweet treats in the afternoon. The hotel more than exceeded our expectations and we would love to go back again\n",

All of their staff were very friendly and helpful they never gave us the run around excuse. They spoke english which made things easier to communicate and there recommendations to places of interest were very helpful. Rooms and bathrooms were always clean and smelled good with a full fresh stock of their amenities (we had two rooms). We had there breakfast and it was a very full and delicious Parisian style. We did not have time to return for there tea nor did we use their fitness/pool amenities. It was a 10 minuet walk to the Louvre museum and about 10-12 minuet walk to the Opera district and to the Shopping district too. I personally would stay here again and would definitely recommend this to anyone who finds my key points helpful.\n",

      "  review_body : For our first time in Paris, we chose Hotel Square Louvois due to the close proximity to the Louvre, the Royal Palais Garden, the Palace Garnier-Opera, Notre-Dame, the Asian district (because we crave rice on trips lol), etc. and because the rooms have AC. We were able to walk to almost everything and took Uber when it was a bit too far (>30 min walk). But from the moment we checked in, we were greeted with the very best in hospitality from the staff. The hotel and room itself is charming but modern in a sense that it has great comfort, style and all the luxury amenities one could hope for (pool, business center, library). We were extremely pleased with having breakfast there (you do pay and can add to the room) but everything is freshly prepared from the juices to the delicious eggs/bacon/sausage to the warm pastries and is hosted by wonderful staff. Stopping in for tea time in the afternoons was also a nice touch as it is hosted and complimentary for hotel guests. Never once did we question their genuineness in making our stay as pleasant as possible. As a bonus, we experienced Bastille Day, a mezmorizing experience where the Eiffel Tower lights up the Parisian sky in a dazzling display of fireworks and felt the lively energy of the city leading up to their eventual World Cup victory. What a blast, we'll have to take the kids next time because it did seem family friendly and they too deserve to experience how an exceptional hotel stay in Paris should be. Merci Beaucoup, Hotel Square Louvois...Au revoir.\n",

The bathroom was quite nice with a great shower. The breakfast buffet was excellent each morning. The ability to get a free coffee or hot chocolate at any time was a real bonus as their large coffee machine made great cafe au lait and hot chocolate!The location couldn't be beat, really. Steps to Place de la République and located almost equally between the Republic and Oberkampf metro stations, you are only a 25 minute walk to Les Halles or to Sacre Coeur with loads of shops restaurants, cafes and bakeries all around.There is no on-site parking, but this is very usual for Paris hotels. There is a parking garage about 50m from the hotel, but, really, don't get a car for a visit to Paris; use the metro. It's far easier and safer, as driving in Paris, for North Americans, is akin to madness. \n",

This is the first hotel that does their scrambled eggs right! Creamy, fluffy, still runny and kept warm! Better than EVERY 5* and luxury hotels we have stayed in! 18€ per person gives you a selection of cheeses, cold cuts, sausage, eggs, fruits, yogurt and a machine for you to squeeze your own orange juice. Needless to say, we had two glasses of OJ each morning!There’s a FOC coffee machine that dispenses hot coffee/tea/milk/chocolate 24/7. Takeaway cups were provided too, for guest convenience. Oh, they occasionally had muffins/pastries to go with your coffee. Very nice touch!Wanted to find traditional beef bourginion but couldn’t get any, so we asked for help at the reception. Hugo and Julie both went out of their way to search for very local food, provided a few options, explained their specialties, gave us some time to consider, and then made a booking for us immediately.

It's still surrounded by a number of wonderful restaurants also a perfect place to area to shop from major brands to boutique designers. I stayed here for 5 days and that still wasn't enough time for me to explore all the shops.The location was still in walking distance to several bars and clubs, but they were far enough that they would distract you if you try to sleep. As with many boutique hotels, the room was small (though not as small as expected) as was the elevator - though I never felt like it was too crammed even with two large suitcases. There were a number of large windows which could be opened to air out space if it's ever needed - though if you wanted to sleep in, it's very hard to keep the room completely dark in the mornings.The front desk staff were very friendly and efficient, and there was always a plate of croissant and pastries out for guests to consume throughout the day. There is also an espresso machine that's available for use at any time, which can be quite convenient in Paris as coffee can be quite expensive.Thanks for the wonderful stay and I hope to return one day!\n",

The transportation links are excellent. We got the train from the airport to Port Royal and it was only a short walk to the hotel along Boulevard du Montparnasse.

A tasty self service breakfast was available starting at 7 AM. The hotel staff spoke good English. From the hotel it is around a 30 to 45 minute walk to Notre Dame, the Eiffel tower, and the Louvre. The price was good for a hotel in Paris. I would not hesitate to stay there again should I travel back to Paris.\n",

We didn’t book breakfast as we wanted to try different places and we were not disappointed. We had a superior room and it was worth the extra to have a bit more space. Our room was spotless and kept spotless throughout our stay. We loved the area and couldn’t wait to get back each night after long days sightseeing. We got a taxi to and from the airport, it is a flat free of €55 euro and worth it. Just make sure you go to the official taxi rank and not the guys in the airport. The only thing I would have to say negative about our stay was that the lift was quite smelly, but it’s a minor thing and wouldn’t stop us staying there again.We loved it! \n",

The area is not as busy as the other areas of Paris but it has everything you need. The bus and metro stations were very near and the area was very safe. Our room was very spacious, clean and we found it very cozy. The receptionists and other hotel staff were very helpful and very friendly as well. We didn’t get to try the breakfast since we opted to just have it outside the hotel because there were so many cafés and restaurants in the area. The only thing I didn’t like is the smell of the carpet in the lift but other than that our 7 night stay was great. We’ll definitely be back. \n",

      "  review_body : We booked this hotel through easyJet with the flights so we weren’t too sure what we were going to get... well I was very pleasantly surprised it was a lovely hotel situated in the arty part of Paris as the name would indicate. It was nicely situated with a two minute walk to nearest the Metro station in a lovely quiet side street off Raspail boulevard. There were all types of restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk catering for every palette and price. The hotel staff were really nice and helpful and very approachable nothing was too much trouble and the reception was staffed 24 hours a day. The hotel is really well decorated with charming quotes taken from famous artists written on all the hotel room doors so brush up on your French or download a translation app before you go. The room we had was great it was big, clean and warm which was great to come back to after a long day sightseeing in the freezing cold and snow. It had a shower over the bath all standard fayre and a bar/ fridge with a safe built into the large wardrobe. The breakfast was very nice with lots too choose from cold buffet and boiled eggs or scrambled egg and small sausages. Pastries of all varieties, toast and associated preserves., fresh fruit, cereals and yoghurt. All buffet style help yourself too as much or as little as you want.I will certainly being go back as I would think in the Spring/ summer it will really shine.My one piece of advice to you if fly into Charles de Gaulle airport DO NOT USE THE GUYS HANGING AROUND THE ARRIVALS AREA GO STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE MAIN TAXI RANK. As these guys run privately owned cars with no plates etc and can charge what they want as there is no metre in the car. The guys on the rank are licensed by the Paris city authority and have set tariffs we paid €62 to get to the hotel which was a 40 minute ride so not too bad really.\n",

The hotel is in a quiet side street but within walking and wheeling distance of plenty of lively bars and restaurants. It’s well decorated, very clean and the staff are all very helpful and accommodating. Our room had plenty of space for me, a wheelchair user, although the corridor and door opening are a little narrow, so it would make sense to check with the hotel first if you have a wide chair. The bathroom is huge, the shower excellent, it has no bathtub. A foldable plastic chair might be a good idea for those needing to sit down in the shower, I’m sure the staff would happily oblige. The bed is very comfortable, we slept really well both nights and there was absolutely no noise from outside. The hotel entrance is wheelchair accessible and there is always someone on reception to provide help if needed.Thanks to Pauline on Reception who was quick to answer my emails when I first enquired about the hotel and was very helpful when I followed up by phoning the hotel and speaking with her.We are pleased to have found such a lovely place to stay and I’m sure we will be back at the Hotel A La Villa Des Artistes again next year.\n",

It is within easy walking distance of multiple Metro lines as well as the Palais Royal RER line (best way to get to and from the airport) and a 15-minute walk from Montparnasse train station. There are many fine restaurants and cafes in a four block radius, in all price ranges. The room (a deluxe twin on the first floor) was spacious and comfortable, with plenty of hot water and great shower pressure, fluffy white towels, nicely firm mattresses and crisp linens, good storage, a minibar into which you can put your own things, and a hot water maker. There was a nice big openable window looking over the breakfast courtyard garden. There was a working radiator and quiet but effective a/c. The wifi was decent, and free. The staff were great - all spoke English, and all were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was fine - cereal, fruit and fresh fruit salad, 3 kinds of yogurts, cheese, cold cuts, scrambled eggs (better than most), hard boiled eggs, fresh baguettes, croissants, rolls, plain bread, juices, coffee, tea, butter, jam, and (most importantly) Nutella. Best of all, it was dead quiet day and night. Highly recommended (the deluxe was a splurge for us). \n",

      "  review_body : I feel “meh” about this hotel. Upon check in we (my Mum and I) were told that we had been upgraded. Which was great. Only we were put in an “outhouse” outside and instead of the twin beds I had asked for upon booking, we were given one queen bed. The room itself was tired, there was a table that was wonky/clearly broken and in the bathroom the extractor fan didn’t work. There was no other ventalation as there was no window in the bathroom. To get out of the hotel, we had to go through the conservatory where people were eating their breakfast each morning. You also are only given one key that has to be left at the front desk when you leave the hotel each time, which I found unnecessary. It just wasn’t the greatest or nicest experience unfortunately. In isolation all of these things are low key. But compiled together it just made for an irritating experience. Especially for my Mum as this was her first trip to Paris. Perhaps the rooms in the actual hotel are better? Other’s seem to think so. And yes, I could have complained and asked to be moved, but by the time I had seen my room, my Mum had unpacked and said she didn’t want to fuss as we were only there for a short time so she wanted to get out and see everything. Also, I think if someone has specifically requested twin beds, the hotel should know that changing the booking to provide one bed isn’t suitable. It is in a great location though, easy to get to all of the top tourist spots either by foot or via Vavin metro. \n",

There are actually a few small art galleries and artistes ateliers on this quiet side street - lending the establishment its name - and the iconic Le Dome' is a stones throw away.. all in all - just what we had in mind - we did not spend a lot of time at the hotel aside from sleeping, showering and having breakfast - there are too many interesting places and sights only a short walk away!

It is also walking distance from the Luxemborg Gardens. Coming back to the hotel, rooms are moderately sized and well kept. It's nothing fancy but clean and housekeeping staff does their job well. It's cosy and comfortable. Breakfast is served at the small dining room. They serve hot as well as cold breakfast. The menu remains unchanged but they have cereals, eggs, freshly baked bread, cold cuts & cheese everyday. That is more than sufficient to start the morning. The reception staff is also helpful and will guide you through the city transport. My only problem was the Wi Fi which was a bit slow.Apart from that it was a great stay.\n",

This is a very trendy part of Paris and only a few minutes walk to Jardins de Luxembourg which leads down to San Michel and Notre Dam.The hotel is modern and our room was large, clean,l very comfortable and quiet. The hotel also has a quaint garden patio beside the restaurant. Must give a special mention to the receptionist Pauline who was very welcoming and helpful during our stay.We look forward to staying at this hotel again and have no hesitation in recommending it to others.\n",

      "  review_body : We often stay in Montparnasse and this hotel is typical of many 3 star hotels in the area. The bedrooms are small (as always in Paris), it's scrupulously clean and well-equipped and the reception staff are helpful. The location is perfect, a few metres from the main Boulevard and metro stops in easy walking distance - Vavin, Montparnasse and Edgar Quinet - which give easy access to about five different lines. Despite being close to busy roads, it's particularly quiet at night especially as our room was at the back overlooking the patio. There are many bars and restaurants in walking distance. The reception area is cosy with easy chairs and a bar. We didn't have breakfast but there are countless cafes nearby if all you fancy in the morning is a coffee and a croissant.The views from the bedroom of the backs of houses are not great but we weren't in the rooms for long anyway. The free wi-fi is a touch slow but we were on the fourth floor. Strangely the tea/coffee making facilities included only thin paper cups. Boiling water and paper cups? NO! Despite this small criticism, it's a nice hotel in a great area of Paris.\n"

      "  review_body : This is probably a good value for money, comfortable hotel by Paris standards. We were pleased we had booked a deluxe room, as even this was quite small. Apart from hanging a few clothes in the wardrobe, we more or less lived out of our suitcases, as there was such little storage space. The room was, however, pleasantly decorated with a good bathroom. I was glad that I had read on TA that only paper cups were provided for tea in the room, so we packed our own mugs. This seems to me, a rather unnecessary thing to have to do. The breakfast was ok & in quite an attractive space overlooking the patio. Choice was rather limited, but that has been our experience in most of France. One morning I was disappointed to be told there were no hard boiled eggs. As someone who suffers with many food intolerances, this left me with very few options, & bearing in mind that breakfast was €16 I was none too happy. I was somewhat surprised, about 5 minutes later, to see a member of staff turn up with cartons of eggs. It would have been nice to be told that if I was prepared to wait I could have had one. I am sorry to say that we didn't feel confident with the reception staff. Their people skills were lacking, & directions vague, seemingly unsure of the quickest route to the Luxembourg Gardens. We would have like to receive more smiles.The huge advantage of this hotel has to be its location, being near to metro options & main line trains. And it is for this reason, plus relative value for money, that we would consider returning, as despite my constructive criticism I feel this place may compare well to others in Paris.\n",

We found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The lobby is under renovation so it wasn’t quite up to par. However, when we saw our recently renovated room, it was clear they are doing an excellent job of upgrading the hotel. The room was wonderful and comfortable, albeit small. That is to be expected in this city. Right outside the front door of the hotel, the exploring begins. Fabulous small shops and restaurants go on forever in the style of a small French village. Moulin Rouge cabaret was just down the street, but sadly sold out for the nights we were there. This hotel provided a relaxing respite from our busy days. When we returned in the afternoons, we were offered a glass of sparkling wine...a classy touch! We had a small problem with our room. The management went the extra mile to be certain we were satisfied. I can recommend this hotel highly. Lovely staff, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. We will return.\n",

The staff are very friendly, giving the place a family kind of feel, and the rooms are clean and modern with nice facilities. The location is perfect, being part way up the hill from Pigalle, and half-way up towards Sacre Coeur. There's plenty of great restaurants within a short stroll, including some of the best Paris has to offer, and the village feel of Montmarte adds to the authenticity of the place, and really makes you feel like you're in Paris.The breakfast is decent, with a good selection of continental choices as well as fruits and cold meats, and the common areas are funky and cool, fitting of the arty vibe.There is parking available too (book in advance), which is a short walk from the hotel and relatively easily accessible. The rooms are small, so keep this in mind especially if two people are travelling, but it is comfortable nonetheless, and I made it work well for me even while travelling on business. One of the nicest features was the views. I had a great view from my window, and I could even see the Eiffel Tower! Brilliant!

Rooms were very clean, a decent size of space and of course you got a great view out the window. The hotel had left us half bottle of champagne as a welcome gift. Down stairs from the entrance in the breakfast room, they have tea coffee and juice available from 3-11pm...thats very handy to round off your day or evening. i would certainly stay again.

      "  review_body : I used this hotel when I came to France to teach. It was recommended by a French colleague who also used it when she came from Aix to teach in the same program. It was comfortable and cheerful. The neighborhood is energetic and full of characters who live among the troupes of tourists who flow past. The hotel had a good breakfast in their cozy sous-sol and that is being maintained well. The rooms are Paris-sized for the price with very good fixtures. The hotel is being renovated as of September 2019 and many rooms unavailable and the construction makes the reality different from the web page depiction; and that leads here to a one-star demotion. But that will change. Each room has a theme, and some can be, how shall I say, aggressively colorful. Might be best to get an idea beforehand as you may not like rock-and-roll red. There’s a bit of a theme there. A few years back I was waiting the the small sitting room when a few lads pushed in a regulation-sized retro juke box. But it plays good stuff and sits proudly in the parlour. Each room has its own replica rock amp radio, the theme only goes so far. I’m hoping they won’t paint over the elevator door “posters” as they are fun and we’ll-done. Expect a heart welcome at the desk and knowledgeable people with good language skills to help you out, though you might find yourself saying “a bit slower, please.” I’ll likely be back though my work in Paris ends this year and my next visit will be of a nostalgic sort. \n",

      "  review_body : Great, friendly staff at all times of day, who gave excellent recommendations for restaurants, called us a cab, etc. It's in the heart of Montmartre, with an easy walk/stairs to Sacre-Coeur, but on a quiet street. You're 50 yards from fabulous food and adorable bars in any direction and several price ranges. It's all downhill to every major site (except Sacre-Coeur); if you are an avid walker you can get to even the Eiffel Tower in under two hours, but you might want to take a cab or scooter back uphill. Sparkling clean and modern design in the rooms, but this is definitely a \"sleep here and spend your day exploring\" hotel WHICH IS WHY YOU ARE IN PARIS. Try for a room with an exterior window; the airshaft ones are a little dark. A/C is great, toiletries are L'Occitane and delightful.- moderate splurge - the food at Moulin de Galette, just uphill, is FANTASTIC. Set menu 31-39.- for cheapskates - walk down Rue des Martyrs to the Carrefour Express. They have lovely sweet and savory pastries, bottled smoothies and cold coffee, and the counter is a great place to sit, charge your devices and enjoy people-watching. \n",

We are from the States, and wanted something perfectly Paris, in our price range, clean, and most importantly, safe for two girls travelling alone. This hotel was all of that and more. It is tiny so be prepared for that, but the charm outweighs the inconvenience. The staff was excellent, and although we were way early and our room was not yet ready, they let us keep our bags in their storage, and gave us a map of Paris with excellent recommendations. They answered so many questions we had about the city and train to airport navigation. They even gave us an insider tip on where to go for a non-tourist like view of the Eiffle Tower. It is to the side on the river-walk a floor or two up from the tower base before you can cross the water, by the way. We felt not only safe, but welcomed here. Most definitely recommended!\n",

With just two of these between two of us I politely reqested an extra one. I sensed the request was dismissed so I reminded the chap on reception once again as we left for an afternoon of shopping.Upon returning in the evening the request had still not been fulfilled - so we asked the (new) evening receptionist. He simply shook his head and said all rooms are full so it’s not possible. This is an extremely basic request which you would assume is fairly commonplace in a reputable hotel such as this. The ignorance and dismissive attitude of the staff really let the place down, and on this basis we will probably go elsewhere next time we visit Paris. \n",

Close to the metro line and surrounded by dozens of cafes, bars, and eateries makes the location ideal. Walking distance to Sacre Cour and Moulin Rouge makes it easy to satisfy saints and sinners alike! Rooms are small, tasteful, clean, with interesting decor. A small elevator makes most of the rooms easily accessible although the rooms at the top, which have great city views all the way to the Eiffel Tower, require access by a staircase. Staff are welcoming, friendly, and multi-lingual. Didn’t do the breakfast because we preferred to explore the Montmartre cafes. Appears to be scheduled for a renovation of the rooms to introduce more air conditioning. In October this wasn’t needed but I can imagine the summer could be toasty. \n",

Plenty of restaurants and bars close to the hotel- again with helpful friendly staff. Once you head towards the metros the bars and brasseries are more ‘commercial’ .

The negatives, bit warm at night so had window open which at times in the morning got a bit noisy. Shower is a bit small, kept knocking the contol to cold setting (no i dont have a big belly) only mirror in room was on the inside of toilet door so i had to wait for the wife to finish using it before i could use the bathroom. Bit tight with the shower gel and towels a little on the small side. No kettle in room (they do free soft drinks/coffees downstairs but only 3-11pm). Having said that the hotel is well presented, professional and in an excellent location. Loads of bars, cafe etc and attractions nearby.

      "  review_body : Seldom do I write a review (on anything), yet my recent experience at this hotel has prompted me to do so. In a nutshell, this was the single most dissatisfying and unpleasant experience that I have ever had with an Accor-group hotel. Where to start...1. Reception on arrival - bored, and made me feel like I was something of a burden to have to deal with, as opposed to a customer who was paying 200€ to stay for one night;2. WiFi - Would not work in the room I was in, and after mentioning this to the Reception team I was told that it could only be fixed in the morning, but that I was welcome to sit at the bar and use the WiFi there (how gracious);3. The Bar - As a Silver member of Accor, I was presented with a coupon for a welcome drink that I happily used. What they don't tell you though, is that if you ask for a spiced tomato juice, is that you have to actually prepare the entire thing yourself. As well as this, not once was I asked if I would like to buy another drink during the 1.5 hours that I was at the bar, and all other patrons were given what appeared to be complimentary bar snacks - except me..?4. Check out - I could not have envisaged that checking out of a hotel could be such an upsetting experience. I presented my key, and received a simple 'Merci' and that was it. I wasn't expecting a formal salute as I left, but something a bit more customer-focused would have been appreciated, especially as I was the only one leaving at that time. The only benefit that I gained from my one night staying at this hotel was that it was very convenient to get to the train station in the morning. Would I stay here again - you couldn't pay me to stay here again.\n",

This hotel is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in, maybe it was the service that has made me feel this way but it was also flawless in every other aspect, I do not have even one minor complaint about this hotel.  Checking in was quick and easy and we was shown to our room, when we walked in to my surprise the room had been decorated in a gorgeous way. The decor of the room was stunning and it was spotless. We visited when we had the unusually hot weather in February so I was delighted to see that our room led onto a rooftop balcony where I could sit and read in the sun.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough and if I could relive my Paris trip all over again I would in a heart beat. \n",

The rooms are very comfortable (although smaller than we’re used to in Australia) and very clean. The Buffett breakfast was just great especially when you have a full day of touring.

I had requested an early check in but had to wait for 4 hours as there were no rooms available. The rooms are tiny and the rest is pretty much standard Mercure (3 star level amenities, good but basic service levels etc.). Basically if you plan to use the hotel for just sleeping and be out shopping and eating the whole time it’s fine. Honestly, for me it’s a little overpriced and there are much better hotels in the area at these prices.\n",

Comfortable beds, good breakfast buffer. Unfortunately, always some small issues here. This time: the pre-booked bottle of champagne was never delivered, the 2nd one ordered via the reception also failed to arrive with ultimately a hot one being delivered. Also, the laundry bag was returned un-serviced b/c of street strikes.The hotel manager did a good job of apologizing for both, at least.But will for sure come back.

      "  review_body : Convenient hotel located just a stone’s throw away from major attractions and shopping.Room was basic and small (typical of Parisian hotels), but came with all the necessary amenities. Our room faced the yard inside and so was quiet (outside breakfast hours only as the yard was the outdoor dining area for breakfast). Had the customary welcome drink for gold members. That’s where the positives end.- As an Accor gold member, we were assigned room 211, which is a room right next to the lift landing and one of the smallest rooms on the floor. No upgrade was offered but we accepted given that it was “subject to availability”. But surely a better location could have been assigned to your valued gold member and not one next to the lift landing especially given that the sound proofing in the rooms are not exactly top notch. - Hairs were found in one of the towels and on the blanket. - Staff were not rude but not polite either. - We requested for a late check out more than 2 months prior when we booked the rooms through the Accor hotels app. Such a request was conveniently forgotten and when requested during check in, was informed rather abruptly that the hotel was fully booked and nothing could be done. Was advised to check again one night before check out to see if a 1 hour late check out was even possible. (For the record, we were, after much checking to and fro, accorded a 2 hour late check out for “no later than 2pm”.)\n",

The street could get very crowded but the windows closed real tight and we were not disturbed by the noise at all. There are many good brasseries and eating places along the street, and we were spoilt for choice every day. We had breakfast every morning at the hotel cafe. It was a good spread with eggs, cereals, fruits and croissants of course. The hotel is very close to Printemps and Galeries Lafayette.

My favorite hotels were just showing ridiculous prices and so I opted for the Mercure Opera Garnier even though it was still EUR 305 per night. That is steep for a Mercure. Check in these days with Accor is via smart phone or tablet, which is fine by me. Normally I get a free drink as a loyal member of Accor but not this time, only a discount on dinner. However, the Mercure is not a place where you go for dinner so thanks but no thanks. The room I had was, as requested, not facing the street and not near an elevator. However, it was by far the smallest room I have ever had and I sincerely doubt it was the Premium room I had paid for. But it had a double bed and it had a decent bathroom (although I hate having to shower in a bath tub. Who takes a bath in a hotel these days??). Design wise, it is fine. Good bed, no noise and a good breakfast means it is a good business hotel in a good location. But the EUR 305 charge and the omission of the LeClub accor VIP drink make me give it just 3 stars\n",

Pigeon hole rooms with no window views & v v v poor & hostile service. Will now need to keep up with this for 6 days \n",

There was kettle in the room but caps provided were inadequate paper caps. In the bath room plastic caps were provided. I understand that they are preferable to the glass but they could have been solid plastic.

      "  review_body : Clean rooms, very centrally located. Staff are nice... some of them or depending on their mood of the day. All went “ok” with these guys for me until I left. I was on a tight schedule.., so when I got to the hotel from my meetings, I asked for my bags and my taxi was already waiting for me (which was great)by the time I used the ladies room, the very helpful reception team decided to load my bags in the taxi for me. Again - great job. However, I get to the airport in Paris traffic on a Monday afternoon after 1.5 hours and only then realized they have given me someone else’s bag and mine is still at the hotel. By the point I was furious as my flight was in 2 hours and I had a packed trip ahead. Again... not so bad as mistakes do happen...The worst was when I called them to tell them about the mistake- understandably very upset... the staff who finally answered the phone was soooo rude she actually cut me up asking me to stay quite and listen to her!! She then put me on hold to check supposedly... (international calling of course as I was using my roaming number)... then someone else picked up after good 6-7 minutes and pretended it was fresh call... I was fuming by this point and he decided to hang up the phone on me when I asked him to pass the phone back to the other agent...I called back: another lady answered. I told her the problem and asked her to please not hang up... she did! Right in my face!Third time, a gentleman picked up who then finally managed to listen to me and find my bag and send it to me which took an hour of stress... but hey! I got my bag...I’d definitely reconsider before booking there again! \n",

      "  review_body : My family and I booked 2 rooms for an overnight stay on 19 April 2018. Check-in was quick although we were charged €112 extra in total for both rooms, which I hadnt noticed until I got to my room. No explanation offered as to why the bill was €500 when it shouldve been €388. I queried this and another member of staff at reception said its hotel policy to charge a deposit of €100 per room. The math still doesnt add up so I feel a little wary of this charge added without discussion. It will be refunded to us this morning. Please pay close attention to your invoice even when knackered at 11pm.The rooms (standard double and twin) are VERY small and cramped, packed on either side of a very narrow corridor. Id recommend you dont go by the photos online as they are deceptive. The rooms are clean. The pillows are seriously sad - at a minimum, please invest in something better than a lumpy, hard child's pillow with untorn cases (seriously?! See photos). The bathroom is thankfully clean with a hot shower. No toiletries provided - bring your own. The location is this hotel's biggest selling point. Central to everything which was convenient for an overnight stay. For €198/night, Id probably stay elsewhere in future as this was a clean but claustrophobic room...and I can usually sleep anywhere! \n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is very expensive for what you get, which is nothing more than a basic 3 star hotel with no frills. Rooms are tiny and I was in a \"Privilege Room\". I have to laugh at the hotel's responses to clients who complained about the size of the rooms, advising them to book a \"Privilege Room\" next time. If these are supposed to be spacious then I would hate to see a standard room. The wifi is abominable - it doesn't work in certain rooms, and the hotel knows this, because when I complained they were able to tell me exactly which rooms have this problem and which don't. I was moved to a room with working wifi, but most of the time the wifi was so slow it was almost unusable anyway. Note that the hotel has no restaurant and so the breakfasts are very basic for a hotel of this price. In addition, the breakfast room is very small and when it is busy it is extremely cramped and unpleasant. The staff were very friendly and tried to help, so I blame management for trying to rip their guests off. I doubt they get much repeat business, except for business travellers who might be forced to stay there.\n",

I you want to go shopping, the luxury mall La Fayette is just nextdoors, the big metro/RER station Saint Lazare is at a couple of hundred meters from the hotel. The hotel is ok, small rooms but this is quite standard in Paris, air conditioning working fine, a real bath and very nice bathroom, but should ask a room away from the street side as there is a lot of noise coming from the streets very early in the morning. Breakfast was extended and qualitative but the place was rather crowded and small, so don't take any (business) lugage or clothing but leave it in your room until checkout. Automatic (pre-)check-in didn't work as planned as I still had to line up and show my ID card, but no harm done. Automatic check-out was ok but could be faster, maybe they could mention the procedure at the reception desk as I still started to line up in front of the (crowded) reception desk.

      "  review_body : I recently had the great pleasure of staying at the Mercure Paris Opera Garnier for four nights. As with most Parisian hotels, the rooms were not particularly spacious but they were clean, comfortable, and newly remodeled. Two big \"pros\" about the hotel were the service and the location. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. I traveled with a group and they managed to get each of us our room keys quickly and patiently. Most evenings we enjoyed a drink in the courtyard and the wait staff was helpful and accommodating even though most of us only spoke English. In my mind, however, perhaps the greatest asset of this hotel is its location. The location is very convenient for navigating the Metro. It is tucked away on a side street away from traffic but is only a few steps from the Haussman-St. Lazare station where I took the RER to Gare du Nord and CDG and where you can connect to most major Metro lines in the city. The neighborhood itself is incredible if you like shopping. The Galleries Lafayette and Printemps are very near and the Madeleine shopping area is a short walk. Fantastic restaurants abound (I recommend the nearby Mollard, especially if you enjoy fish and seafood) and there is much to see and do with the Opera Garnier, rooftop terrace of Galleries Lafayette, and the Fragonard Museum in the immediate area. I have stayed in Paris many times and this was far and away the best location I have ever enjoyed.One word of caution. If possible, avoid a room on the 6th floor as the elevator only goes to 5 and you will have to carry your luggage up some steps.A great hotel in a great location and outstanding service to match. I would not think twice about staying at Mercure Paris Opera Garnier again.\n",

      "  review_body : My husband and I made a last minute booking and decided to stay at this hotel for 4 nights. The room that we were originally given had a broken sliding door to the bathroom and the bath did not drain properly. We noticed this within the first 30 minutes and I will say that the hotel handled our concerns well and provided us with an alternative room (which was actually much bigger, which we appreciated).With that being said, even the upgraded room did not really compensate for what this hotel was lacking. Our bathroom in the new room had a broken tile. Further, the rooms have zero noise cancellation, so you can hear every door shut or open, every voice, etc. especially at night. By far the biggest complaint of mine is the service. This is a 4-star hotel in Paris. Guests are paying a considerable amount and are expecting 4-star service. This hotel did not provide that. With the exception of Yoni, who was very kind, everyone else we spoke with throughout our stay seemed unhappy and irritated. We even caught one of the receptionists roll her eyes at guests who came and asked for something. When you walk into your hotel lobby, you expect at least a smile. The majority of the people who work at this hotel do not seem to want to be there and it shows. We felt extremely cheated, considering this was a pricier option for us and we booked it expecting an exceptional experience.All in all, I would not recommend. I think that you can spend much less and get better service and better quality rooms (without as many defects). I am hoping that my experience is a one-off...\n",

He spent several hours on the phone and emailing to help resolve our issue which was above and beyond his job. He was very courteous and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "  review_body : If you want to stay in the most amazing, central location without the price tag of the Ritz, you owe it to yourself to check Hotel Cambon. We chose it for the location and convenience. Location was our highest consideration on this short trip to Paris with our children -- their first visit. That said, within the central \"walking distance to everything\" locations, this was by far the most amazing value we found. Before we arrived, they were already helping us, answering silly questions about local traffic, hairdryers, etc. and even making a few dinner reservations for us (what a convenience for a few places we liked that didn't have online booking) which they confirmed by email but also presented to us when we arrived. Like having a personal assistant (perhaps I should have used them more!). Having now been, we can recommend it also for the comfortable rooms and friendly service! It's a small hotel, so you see the same few faces each day as you come and go. They mailed our postcards and helped with luggage. The room was small -- as you might imagine -- but fit us very well. It was difficult to find accommodations for four and the room arrangement here was perfect. The bed was large (felt almost like a king?) with an adjoining full room (smaller bed) for our daughters (10 & 14). There was a fridge in each room (we stored our macarons!) but no coffee facility unless you do the hotel breakfast, which we did not. We found coffee and croissant near our first sight each day. On our last day my (kind/generous!) husband went to Happy Cafe (found here on TA) to bring in breakfast as we packed up. LBNL, the bathrooms were sparkling and I love a bright white duvet -- this was my favorite bed of three hotels on this trip. Highly recommend this hotel. We'll be back!\n",

The room was spacious for a couple BUT not for a family of four (especially if American and basing on that standard, this is a European boutique hotel). I know some reviews were not favorable towards the junior suite but we enjoyed it (size and comfort). Cannot bear the location!! Easy walking distance to Opera House, Place Vendôme, Place de la Concorde, Champs Elysees, Louvre, and across street from Jardin de Tuileries. Staff super friendly and welcoming. There is construction but only from 10a-5p and didn’t bother us (we slept late and were fine). Highly recommend!!!\n",

No free bottled water provided and bathroom amenities were pretty basic. Also, there was a strange chemical smell in the hallway when I checked in. The staff was kind and prompt enough to address it. Breakfast was really nice. Location was great although my timing made it a tad inconvenient because of the visiting heads of state staying or having meetings in close proximity for the 100th anniversary of the armistice, leading to many road closures for both pedestrians and motorists.\n",

The room was nice, there was some sort of mix up when we were checking in so our room was upgraded upon arrival which I truly appreciated. We also paid to be picked up from the airport through the hotel, and our ride was on time and easy to find. However, as we were checking out, the staff at the front desk asked that we confirm that we had two coffees at breakfast. When we claimed that we did not have coffees, instead of taking our word for it, the person behind the front desk proceeded to call over other staff members who claimed to see us drinking coffee at breakfast. It was all very bizarre, and really rude- Especially to my significant other who cannot drink caffeine due to a heart condition and was very offended and frustrated. Why argue and embarrass us over two cups of coffee that we did not have? I don't often write a bad review- and I do have to note the positives mentioned above- but this interaction left a really bad taste in my mouth.\n",

I’d also say that the 4 star rating is certainly not accurate - it’s 3 stars at best. I was travelling alone and booked a room with a double bed. However, in reality the rooms have two single beds pushed together (see the photo) which kept moving apart all night and left me with an aching back and a terrible headache due to getting only 2 hours sleep. When I asked the reception if they could give me a room for the 2nd night with one proper bed they said they were fully booked so I was stuck with it as every other hotel in the area was now also fully booked. Never had a problem at even the most budget hotel in Paris before. If I’d been travelling as a couple then it would be absolute hell so unfortunately not one to recommend unless your extremely petite.\n",

Our only criticism is that the hot breakfast food (bacon/ham, eggs, baked beans etc) was always a bit cool rather than hot. I’d have loved a microwave to reheat. I didn’t mention it at the time though, probably didn’t want to make a fuss. It certainly wasn’t a deal breaker and we’d happily stay again and recommend Hotel Cambon to anyone trying to decide where to stay. The location to Tuileries Garden and surrounds and the Paris City Vision tour office was really convenient as well. Thanks for looking after us, we’d love to come back one day. \n",

There is a hairdryer attached to the wall but very hard to handle (have to press the button the whole time for it to be ON, Causes a bit of a cramp in your hand). Breakfast is nice but basic but it was perfect for my taste. Croissants were fresh and great! And the employees were all nice and professional. An extra, the restaurant just in front is very good. Usefull when you are too exhausted to go too far. I recommend this hotel.\n",

The neighborhood is very cute and loaded with cute boutiques.The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We started most mornings with the breakfast buffet. And the coffee was wonderful. The lobby area was very comfortable for lounging or regrouping after a day of sightseeing. We relaxed there many days as they offer “happy time” with juice and cakes from 4-6.

They spoke excellent English and really went out of their way to always greet us or help in any way possible. The room size was acceptable (not large but that was OK), and it was very clean and nicely decorated. This hotel is fairly small, which was nice since it never seemed to be busy. Breakfast was included with our room, and it was very good as well. The location was fantastic. We walked to the Eiffel Tower, a Seine River Cruise, the Louvre, Notre Dame, the catacombs, and restaurants are everywhere, so dining was never difficult to get to. Overall, I definitely recommend this hotel.\n",

      "  review_body : Allow me to preface my review by saying that I am reviewing this hotel as someone who is conscious of the cultural differences between Americans and Parisians. If you expect someone to roll out a red carpet for you and treat you like a pretty princess, maybe you shouldn’t go to Paris... I do believe, however, that the hotel should alert guests to renovations well in advance of their stay. There is no excuse - none - for “overlooking” this activity.... the negative aside...The Aurore Suite is fantastic. Perfectly situated on the highest floor of the hotel, the suite has a view of the Eiffel Tower from the bedroom and a spacious terrace looking over the Esplanade with southern/eastern facing views of Paris. We skipped dining out for every meal and enjoyed picnics on the terrace instead.The location is quite ideal. You’re in a nice neighborhood that isn’t too touristic but you’re still close to the action. The Invalides metro is well connected. Honestly, if you’re up for a little trek, you can access the major sites all by foot. Would I stay here again? Yes. I’m not quite certain I’ll be able to stay in Paris unless I’m in the Aurore Suite. I’ve spent a lot of my life in Paris and it’s not easy to find a space - especially at this price point - quite so spectacular.\n",

      "  review_body : I wanted to add a more balanced review to this page, so here it is.The hotel is lovely. Very pretty, very ‘instagrammable’ if that’s what you’re into. Lovely pastel Parisian interiors and very clean.The staff are very friendly and polite.Breakfast in bed is a must, we were very lazy and had this every day and it was pure joy. Amazing poached eggs.We ate in the hotel restaurant one of the evenings and it was all delicious.Our room (superior) was beautiful and a good size overall however the bathroom was tiny. Travelling as a couple it’s useful to be able to get ready in the bathroom at the same time but you couldn’t comfortably fit two people in here. There was also no full size mirror in the room (only a small one inside the wardrobe) so getting ready was a challenge. The room lacked wardrobe and drawer space so we had to leave little piles of clothes on the chairs, which meant we couldn’t use any of the chairs, so everything just felt a bit more cramped.In the corridors they play music which unfortunately could be heard from within the room. We had to ask for this to be turned off at 12am so we could sleep. Other than this we had a courtyard-facing room which was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable and we had many good nights’ sleep. We used the spa every day before dinner, really well fitted out and very clean. We never struggled to get a cozy place to sit and relax, despite the hotel being full. The jacuzzi was a little cold.Overall whilst the hotel has the facilities of a five star hotel it feels more like a high-standard four star hotel. I think this is reflected in its price so the value is good. I would stay again but I would pick a larger room. Also, the location is perfect - this is a nice classy part of Paris. \n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is the best kept secret in Paris! Nestled in the quiet, historical, and classy 7th Arrondisement, central to many popular attractions. I took at least 15 taxi rides and not one of the drivers had ever heard of this beautiful little Hotel - this is a good thing! I had a deluxe room on the 4th floor. The room was quiet, clean, and more than adequate for 1 or 2 persons. The bathroom was Italian style I was told with a bathtub, and separate stand up shower. Had an issue with the lack of space to put toiletries or anything near the bathroom sink, no big deal though. The room had a safe and minibar as well. This is an absolutely gorgeous property. It is kept immaculately clean and had a staff that was wonderful. Breakfast was included with my room and was ok - nothing special, but nothing bad either. I want to give a HUGE thank you to concierge Julien who helped me for months via email setting up this magnificent trip. Julien went above and beyond in every possible way to help me with anything and everything I needed to make my stay pleasant. I always travel with a portable desk fan so I can be as cool as I need and want to be, so I brought one from the US. I plugged it in, and it blew up immediately due to the current being different LOL. I called Julien and within 10 minutes, had a beautiful Dyson fan in my room! I asked him to purchase a small fan for me to travel with since I was going to another city in France and voila, a new fan was in my room! Also a shout out to concierge Hakim as well for helping me plan my trip, as well as the front desk staff who all went out of their way to make my stay virtually perfect. The hotel has a spa and pool on the \"-1\" floor which was SPECTACULAR! I have never enjoyed an indoor jacuzzi & jacuzzi pool as much as I did this one. The water color was a deep blue with powerful jets installed at the end, the atmosphere was relaxing and serene, making the whole feel of this place ultra luxurious and comfortable. Only one minor criticism I had was my room had a balcony, but it was filled with large plants :( which eliminated the ability to go outside, or leave the door open due to many insects flying around the planters. I think they should remove those plants to allow guests to go outside of their room on the balcony, maybe put a chair or 2 out there as well. Would have loved to have been able to sit and sip coffee or tea outside on the balcony! No matter, I cannot tell you how much I loved this hotel, it is worth every cent they charge to stay there and should I ever return to Paris, this will be my Hotel of choice for sure.\n",

      "  review_body : My Husband and I stayed here on the first leg of our honeymoon. I am a Hyatt Platinum member and this hotel was offered to me in the networks of small boutique hotels. I wanted a hotel in a prime location with a romantic vibe and Le Narcisse Blanc sure delivered that. Upon arrival the hotel concierge contacted me and asked if they could set up hotel transportation from the airport, which was a wonderful touch for us to have never have traveled to Paris before. Once we arrived they opened the door, helped with baggage and even gave us a map to where we could walk for lunch. The hotel is very clean and even the standard room we stayed in had beautiful decor. The pool was a great touch to have a drink by after a long day of site seeing. The hotel is right by the river and the walk to Eiffel Tower is about ten minutes. The hotel is right by so many cute small cafes to eat and have a drink at. I was very impressed with the service of the hotel the entire stay and cant wait to go back soon.\n",

Near Hotel des Invalides, 2 blocks from the Seine in quiet neighborhood. The hotel is nicely furnished for what it is.Now the rest: generally unhelpful, inflexible front desk staff; postage stamp size rooms barely able to accommodate a king bed, tiny bathroom with very narrow shower; fitness \"center\" consusting of 1 bike & 1 older treadmill; scaled down, cramped mediocre breakfast buffet. While it appears on the internet that this is a Hyatt, as our party was told on several occasions, it is not. Rather, it is a 3-4 star, 37 room, space challenged Hyatt \"partner\" hotel. It would have been much better with only 20 rooms and, therefore, better spatial opportunities. Having been to Paris on many occasions, this will be my last stay at this prooerty.\n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I stayed at Le Narcisse Blanc for one night, while trekking through Europe for a our anniversary. We chose the Aurore Suite, and had the best single night of our journey. Below is a review of our experience:Arrival / Check-in:We arrived in Paris via Eurostar from London, so we took a taxi from Gare du Nord to Le Narcisse Blanc. Easy enough - took about 20 minutes (mostly traffic) and cost about 15 euro. Though we arrived to the hotel relatively early (around Noon), they had our room ready with a bottle of champagne sitting in it. We were given a tour of our room by a very nice concierge and then offered the chance to make local reservations or walking routes. Very pleased to have a room ready so early so we could relax.Service:Paris can have a reputation for being a bit more abrupt, but you won't find that here. Everyone from concierge, to front desk, to housekeeping was nothing but bright and kind. We did not order room service during our stay, but they did drop by several times to deliver chocolates and personal cards welcoming us.Room:This room was the highlight of our trip through Europe. Located on the top (5th) floor, you walk into the room via a small foyer that has its own desk and separate bar / coffee station with a Nespresso machine and mini bar. To the right are big double doors to the King Bed and the bedroom. The bedroom has two sets of large double windows that open up to the Parisian neighborhood and a view of the Eiffel Tower. Of course, the can be covered by floor to ceiling blackout drapes. Down the hallway on the other end of the room is a separate bathroom with rainfall shower and tub that overlooks a glass wall into the City. Of course it can be covered by a large curtain, but the view while looking into the bathroom mirror is amazing. This also opens onto a large personal balcony with its own loungers and table for enjoying the outdoors. Because they offer a noon checkout, we loved the room so much it was hard leaving to explore the city!Property / Location:It is a boutique hotel, so the public quarters are smaller, but there are also very few rooms, so everything felt very personal. The hotel is located on a quiet street in the 7th, that feels mostly upscale residential. The streets out front were not too busy and perfect for walking to St Germain, the Louvre, or Eiffel tower - all within a 15 minute walk. The spa area on the bottom floor is beautiful with a full lap pool, large soaking hot tub, sauna, hamaam, lounge area and changing rooms. We spent a while resting in this area, as it was not crowded and quiet / calming.Overall Impression: Beautiful, safe property. Comfortable, large room with a view. Quiet, relaxing spa. Kind, helpful service. This was our best overall experience in Europe and we would recommend to anyone, and definitely hope to return.\n",

We were lucky to get a room here on short notice -- we had originally booked a VRBO apartment near the Eiffel Tower that was cluttered and filthy, so we had to bail on that and find something quickly on short notice. The service at the hotel was superb, from the front desk to concierge. They were very helpful and friendly. My wife and I stayed in a Deluxe Room, which was good sized, clean and the bedding was very comfortable. It also had a French balcony with a view of the street. The bathroom was also nice sized with a walk in shower. I would stay here again. We were with another couple and it turned out the husband needed a wheelchair to get around the city and the concierge was able to quickly procure a rental wheelchair for him and took care of all the arrangements. I was impressed with their helpful, can-do attitude.\n",

      "  review_body : There are some very good things about this hotel. The location is lovely. It’s about a 20 minute stroll to the The Eiffel Tower and and a 10 minute stroll down to the Seine (where you can pick up the Batobus once crossing the bridge). The reception staff are absolutely lovely. The rooms are opulent if a bit O.T.T but that’s where it ends.I stayed here for a while and stayed in different rooms. The ground floor room has a “private terrace” – umm, not so at all. The terrace is basically the main smoking area for the hotel just “shielded” off with some small dead Christmas trees. I don’t smoke and found that people had thrown their cigarette buts onto the terrace which was disgusting and you can’t open the windows without smoke blowing into your room (the French smoke strong cigarettes). Other than that the furniture is very low (especially for a room that is supposed to be used by people with disabilities). The bathroom is great as there is somewhere to sit in the shower and it has a raised toilet, but if you have problems with your hips and or knees you are going to struggle to in and out of the bed or up or down onto the sofa. The other BIG problem with this room is it’s very noisy. It’s directly above the “spa” – more particularly the hot tub in the spa. This means whenever someone is in there you can hear it like being in a washing machine and hear people talking downstairs. You also have the internet desk for the hotel right behind your head board, so you can often hear people right behind you whilst you’re trying to nap. So definitely not somewhere for a romantic getaway.I had to stay in a top floor suite for a night which was lovely but a long trog to the bathroom and the lift is not for anyone who doesn’t like heights etc. It’s basically a box on a cable rather than a modern lift. The very, very worst thing about this hotel is the room service. I know who should care abut room service but as a woman travelling on my own room service is very important if you don’t want to spend meal after meal being stared at eating in restaurants on your own. I always pick expensive hotels expecting that they will have the room service to match. This is absolutely diabolically bad. The worst I’ve ever experienced. So bad, that despite staying quite a long time I only used it twice. The first time I ordered pene bolognaise and the “cake of the day” (there is a very, very limited choice). What I got was a bowl of what looked like pene that had been boiled from dry (not fresh) and a spoonful of thin tomato type sauce that was pretty vile. If it hadn’t been for the grated Parmesan it would have tasted like cardboard. It was hard to chew and just not at all good. The “cake of the day” was two slices of DRY banana bread. Just dumped on a plate. It looked like the sort of dinner I would send up to a naughty child who’d been sent to their room for misbehaving. It was also crazily expensive. Later in my trip I thought I’d give it another try and ordered a 3 cheese pizza – how could anyone could wrong with that? What I got was basically a microwaved frozen pizza and not even a good one of those. The sort of thing you might nuke for yourself at a motorway service station garage. Really seriously horribly awful. The other thing was the conceirege. I wish I’d taken their names. One was super helpful, respectful, young and humours and made me feel very at home. The other was a bit of a ****. He admonished me for taking my own luggage to reception (a few steps from my door). I don’t think any staff should ever speak to a guest in the way he spoke to me. I was really quite taken aback.There were a lot of older men with what I took to be their younger mistresses and I would imagine it goes down very well with that crowd but if you are looking for a real top unobtrusive home from home this is certainly not it, which is a shame because some people working there are really going out of their way to make it lovely, but are being let down badly by the things that are going seriously wrong.So, I won’t going back. This hotel is a lot of style over substance. It’s a shame because it could be really good. They need to stop believing their own hype. No amount of their own scent in the products and fancy logos all over the place will make up for a lack of basic amenity such as decent food.\n",

      "  review_body : Our first visit to Paris was made memorable by this wonderful hotel and its staff. The room was perfect for the way we travel as the sleeping quarters were separated from the sitting room by a short hallway that kept light and sound from disturbing whoever was sleeping. The bed was extremely comfortable made more so by the soft, fluffy linens. The room had a Nespesso machine so we could enjoy coffee while we lounged away a morning. .The breakfast (included) served in the dining room was a perfect way to start the day and the meal we ate at dinner the first night of our stay was one of the best we had in Paris. The best part of the entire experience was the staff. The concierge team, led by Hakim and ably assisted by Juiien, Clement, Johan, et al., was quite helpful and attentive with many good suggestions on restaurants, attractions, directions and schedule.The hotel is several blocks south of the Seine River and a 10 minute walk from many of the top attractions (Eiffel Tower, Musee D'Orsay, The Louvre, etc.). We couldn't have been happier with the location, the experience and the wonderful people we met!\n",

The concierge team at the hotel was incredibly helpful and attentive and made us feel like VIP guests. With only about a week's notice, they were able to book 2nd row tickets for us to the sold-out ballet at Opera National de Paris, which we would not have been able to secure for ourselves. Nightly turn down service was a treat and the all staff were so delightful and kind. I happen to have a gluten allergy and was thrilled to learn that their breakfast menu offered a collection of quite tasty gluten-free pastries, including chocolate and butter croissants and a farm bread. Although we tried to speak mostly in French, the staff also speaks excellent English. I also happen to quite dislike elevators and was pleased that the 5-story hotel offered both a beautiful spiral staircase as well as a glass elevator that was comfortable for me to ride. The neighborhood was also very convenient, in close proximity to many adorable restaurants and shops on Rue Clare.\n",

      "  review_body : I spent four nights here over the past few weeks. Everything was pretty much perfect. I usually stay at the Park Hyatt and I enjoyed this hotel and it’s location even better and the price was about half as much. The concierge was super helpful with restaurants, and easy to work with over text. Check in staff friendly, the restaurant food was wonderful (I had dinner, lunch and breakfast at least once during my stay) and the ground level room was spacious and perfect, with a charming garden patio where I could sit and have wine and get fresh air. Room noise was low other than some footsteps on the floor above now and then and the bed was very comfortable.The bathroom was large as well, while the room also had a nice large safe and hotel WiFi worked like a charm. I was able to converse with staff either in English or my broken French, all with no problems. I suggest booking through the hotel not through Hyatt as the Hyatt app was giving much higher room rates. Check out was a breeze and no surprises on the bill which is always nice.The area is fantastic with lots of little bakeries, good restaurants, the beautiful views of the Eiffel Tower and lots of hustle and bustle of parents walking their kids to school in the morning. Easy walking to Right Bank as well, just over the bridge and you’re there.I can’t wait to visit again (maybe I can get a discount if I stay a whole month!)Only suggestions.... the Room Service menu didn’t say how to contact room service.. had to look that up another way. Also would be nice to just be able to order the full Cleo menu in Room Service, but was told one can’t. Again, I can’t recommend this hotel enough, really perfect.\n",

The hotel was gorgeous, extremely clean, and in a really nice location. The pictures do not do the room justice. The staff went above and beyond during our stay- they gave us restaurant recommendations, answered all of our questions about touristy things, and they even called and waited on hold for us for 20 minutes when we were having a hard time booking our train tickets for a weekend in Switzerland. We were also given a portable wifi to use for the week, which was a really nice and useful touch. As a hotel snob and an extremely critical/picky hotel guest, I can honestly say that I was sad to leave Le Narcisse Blanc. They truly made our week in Paris amazing. Thank you!!!\n",

I’d booked through the hotel to which the concierge arranged the S Class Mercedes for us which was extremely relaxing!We were warmly greeted at the hotel and were shown to our room, the Aurore Suite.Not long after we were in the room, there was a knock at the door, we opened it and a member of staff had a bowl with a candle placed in a piece of cheesecake, a lovely surprise for my wife’s birthday. She also received a birthday card, all were very much appreciated and the cheesecake was absolutely delicious.The room was amazing, lovely comfortable bed with a view of the Eiffel Tower. Through the corridor to the bathroom with rainfall shower and large bath overlooking a private terrace overlooking Paris. Rather than booking breakfast we generally like to do our own thing but on this occasion we booked a pastry basket and cappuccinos which were all reasonably priced and delivered to our room. We also used the spa area of the hotel, there is a gym, pool, steam room, sauna and jacuzzi to which we used all apart from the gym! Around the pool are beds which you can just lounge and relax.In summary, we loved the hotel, the spa and in particular the room, it was fantastic and faultless. The hotel itself is situated in a perfect location to restaurants, bars and general sightseeing.We would definitely return to Le Narcisse Blanc in future and would highly recommend this as a must for your visit to Paris but most importantly thanks for making it so special for my wife’s birthday. \n",

      "  review_body : My father stayed here last week for one week and once again had a wonderful stay. Sarah- the manager once again led a team that was as helpful, warm, and caring as on the last visit. I personally asked them to take good care of him and they did. The chief Concierge, Hakim, went above and beyond. He anticipated restaurant and transfer needs and looked out for him in a manner befitting family rather than a concierge. It is without a doubt a good thing to perform one's duties well in any profession, but to carry them out in such an advance manner and with such sincere humanity is a rare thing. Especially at this price point this performance of duty is expected, but rarely found. I cannot imagine one fault that this hotel would have that could not be made up for by Hakim's presence alone. Hakim remembered every single member of our family of 7 who stayed there last June!However, be aware that it is not only because of overall concierge performance that we would continue to recommend Le Narcisse. The amalgam of cleanliness, the class, and the structural modernity of its design- all while capturing what I would call the avant garde tradiitonal Parisian charm- are why we would continue to recommend it. We hope it stays this way forever.\n",

The location is ideal—out of the way, but near two metro stops and with a couple of perfect cafes right on the block. We stayed in the Cleo suite for a weekend to celebrate our anniversary, and it was one of the best decisions we made when planning. The front desk and concierge were so accommodating and helpful, even before we arrived in Paris. We are already planning our return!\n",

      "  review_body : Business trip to Paris with my husband and we thought we would book a nice hotel in the centre for us to enjoy together. When we arrived the hotel is immaculately clean and the reception staff very friendly - we then get told the lift is out of order - yet they’ve apparently upgraded us to a fifth floor suite - after getting in the service lift which is so small we meet the concierge guy in our room to find it’s actually the room I booked online anyway - no upgrade.We then decide to go for dinner in the restaurant - the food was passable at best and at €8 for a coke very expensive for what we received.The room was nice and very clean so a good nights sleep was welcomed after a busy day.We went for breakfast and after waiting an hour and 15 minutes for pancakes walked out hungry. Incompetent rude staff left to service a busy breakfast sitting - not particularly the 5 star service I was expecting.As we checked out my husband voiced his concerns to the receptionist - who promptly walked away mid through the conversation and began taking to her colleague in French once she realized the bill was paid in full.Terrible service I would not recommend - the only plus for us was the cleanliness.\n",

The metro stop was very close (2 min walk) with easy links to everywhere you wanted to go in Paris. A good selection of restaurant close by. Breakfast buffet was basic but reasonably priced and set us up well for a day of walking the Paris sights. No frills hotel (eg no room service, mini-bar etc) but friendly staff and 24 hour reception.

      "  review_body : My stay at Hotel Marais Bastille was nearly perfect. This hotel has a modern and somewhat minimal aesthetic that I enjoy. The location is excellent, situated on the edge of Le Marais and near at least four different subway lines that will take you anywhere in the city. The staff were always friendly and provided great service. I also appreciated the email from the hotel about a week before my stay, which asked me to fill out a short questionnaire of my preferences and requests. I requested and was given a double room just like the photos, with a small terrace overlooking the boulevard. I arrived early, thanks to a morning flight, but I was allowed to check in around 2:15pm when my room was ready. The room was larger than most Paris hotel rooms at this price, and it was cleaned very well every day of my stay. The bed was too firm for my taste, but I know everyone has different preferences on that. I appreciated the mini-fridge that was empty so I could fill it with my own food and drinks. The bathroom had modern fixtures, and utilized the small space well. Breakfast was not included in my booking, but was not expensive, and I did try it one day when I needed a quick bite before going to the Louvre. It's very French, with an abundance of pastries and breads and not much protein other than some eggs and cold meats & cheese. My only real issue with the hotel is that the WiFi in my room was unreliable. The signal strength in my room was not great, and especially during busy times of day, the connection would become slow or disconnect completely. Aside from that, Hotel Marais Bastille is a great value for the price, and I will likely stay there again on a future visit to Paris.\n",

      "  review_body : Hotel was cute and clean, perfectly located near so many restaurants within walking distance. The room was very very small but comfortable. Only had two complaints about this hotel. First is that the WiFi was very poor and I often had to go sit in the lobby to use my phone which was inconvenient and not would I expected for a hotel in Paris at this price. Second was they would not allow us to check in even 2 minutes before 3pm. We had arrived two hours early and they kindly held our baggage for us as we explored the city, however when we returned 20 minutes before 3pm they made us sit in the lobby waiting until the clock ticked 3pm before they would check us in. I know that 3pm is the check in time, however most hotels I’ve been to in my life will allow you to check in the moment the room becomes available, it was just silly having us and the other guests wait quietly in an empty hotel until it was exactly 3pm when the rooms obviously ready ahead of time. Other than these two minor things it was a lovely comfortable stay and the staff was helpful and cheerful. \n",

One gentleman at the desk was more focused on smoking at the entryway than working, but we only saw him one time and everyone else (about 7-8 different people) were exceptional. The laundry service, which is not in-house, is expensive. We thought we would save money and luggage space with laundry, but this we did not save money by this. Yet, it’s nice they have a laundry option. The location is also very good. There are good cafes and nearby and it is easy access to many popular Paris attractions. We happily stay here again if returning to Paris. We loved to quiet, relaxed boutique atmosphere. \n",

      "  review_body : Don't disregard the positive reviews, rooms are comfortable, staff pleasant and hotel is well situated. However, we found some black pellets on the desk beneath the air con the morning after we checked in. . reported our concerns to the front desk (it appeared to be mouse droppings). . the front desk clerk stared blankly at us without comment. We asked if they had had problems with mice before and she responded slowly, no. . not that I'm aware of. After some pressing she agreed to notify the manager and try to change our room. We suggested the larger brighter room given to our travel companion (who was alone in the larger room, while two of us shared the smaller room - checked in at the same time so why they wouldn't put the two of us in the larger room is another question). Upon our return late that day we asked about a change in rooms and about what the manager said about the mouse droppings. We were told it was dirt from the air conditioner. . (dropped suspiciously in a line perpendicular to the air conditioner?). . and if so, would they then not clean the air conditioners? No room available so we were put back in the same room. Moved to another small dark room the next day (we had to pack our things and move them to our friends room then to the new room at the end of the day). Asked again about a larger, brighter room and were told they would check again. Note new room also had dirt from the air conditioner on the table when we checked in that night. . did not have the same appearance as the pellets from night one. . after 2 nights in the 2nd room we were moved again (after asking again), this time to a larger brighter room. We were told the droppings were looked at by housekeeping and determined to be dirt from the air con. No compensation for the 2 moves, nor any reassurances that they would investigate the possibility of mice. They run a breakfast restaurant on the first floor so mice are a definite possibility. In addition two power converters were removed from the room by housekeeping (I assume) (one I left behind inadvertently just prior to the first move). We had to ask repeatedly to see if they could be found. They had a box of left behind converters, none of which were mine. Rooms were very clean with the exception of the black flakes from the air conditioner. . both black mould and mouse droppings would be toxic. I expected some compensation for the inconvenience of having to move twice and some reassurances that the situation would be properly investigated. Note also that the glass shower doors are very short and it is impossible to keep the counter and floor from getting wet. We did enjoy the very pleasant but not in this regard very helpful, front staff.\n",

Even better.... black out shades to help with street noise ( there wasn’t any) and jet lag. Front desk was helpful and nice. Perhaps the tub may be a little high for you. But my 82 year old mother had no problems. We didn’t eat breakfast. If you need a spa, workout room and room service, perhaps this isn’t your hotel. But seriously.... you are going to Paris to work out? You will get plenty of exercise walking. The view of the Eiffel Tower from this room was stunning and it’s less than a 10 minute walk.

We wanted to stay in the city center since we were planning to do all the tourist stuff during our short time in Paris. We searched and read reviews for a ton of hotels and settled on this one. We could not be happier with our choice. The folks at the front desk were warm and helpful, especially Christian, who offered plates, forks, etc. when we came back late one of the nights with some bread, cheese, and wine for dinner. Christian also offered help with the Metro and other stuff. I believe we reserved the superior room but I don't remember off-hand. We were delighted that we had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our bed, a free upgrade! Room size was bigger than comparable hotels we've stayed at within the EU. The king bed was super comfy and overall the hotel was quiet and clean. They had breakfast for a fee in the morning but we didn't try it. The free snacks during the day were a nice touch.

It is easily accessible by metro with the Ecole Militaire stop steps away. The rooms are quiet and well appointed with very comfortable beds .The bathrooms have face cloths, standard in US bathrooms but not common in European hotels. the morning breakfast buffet is generous and will set you up for a busy day. the staff are friendly and professional and will put up with bad French! English is spoken. From the warm greeting on arrival to the friendly goodbye, hotel staff are wonderful. You won't go wrong with this place\n",

The rooms also show some wear and tear. Our room was right near the elevator and sounds could be heard above as well. I will say the bathroom was clean and modern. Overal this room was not suitable for us and we had to relocate. There may be better rooms in the hotel but this is what we ended up with. The room might've been ok for a solo traveller or for just one night but it didn't work for us as we had 5 nights scheduled. Staff were kind and understanding of the situation.\n",

The location is still great and the staff friendly but a couple of glitches colored the experience. One of the bed lamps was hanging by its wiring, and the room phone didn't work. We have modern smartphones, but the lack of a landline in the room could be consequential in an emergency. As it was, we had to go down 6 floors to the lobby to ask for more hangers.

      "  review_body : We were in an older style room on the 4th floor that could do with a little renovation however for what we paid for this hotel it was very sufficient for our 3 night stay. The service was always friendly and our lack of French was not a worry at all. I thought handing the keys in each time we left would be an inconvenience but it was quite the opposite. No stress of losing the key or shuffling through your bag to find the key and there was always someone ready at the desk to greet you with it. The location is a good central location. It’s not a luxurious hotel like you can splurge and find in Paris, however is very sufficient for a first trip to Paris when you are out to explore. \n",

It was also very easy to find with the Madeleine landmark practically outside.My only complaint was the air conditioning, our room was very hot so we left the air conditioning on, but the maid service would turn it off while we were out so when we got back each night it was very hot.\n",

We had two adjoining rooms with double beds in each. Air conditioners are wall units that worked well enough, but are a bit loud. We didn’t have the breakfast at all as we were out early each day and didn’t want to do a sit down meal. You hand your room key in each time you leave the hotel which was a bit unusual. Great, central location near two metro stations and a lot of attractions. Would stay here again and would recommend it unless you’re someone who wants modern style and comforts. In that case, this hotel wouldn’t be for you. The staff was really friendly and helpful too. \n",

We arrived approx 11:30pm for check in and staff very friendly and helpful. Have you give your key back to reception when you leave for the day but it saves you possibly losing it! Room was small but that’s what you expect for Paris, bathroom was bigger than we’ve had previously in Paris. I think the bathrooms have been recently renovated as they seemed a lot more modern than anything else in the hotel. Oh and air-con worked a treat! That’s mainly why we picked this hotel as it seemed a lot cheaper than others and also mentioned air-con, much needed after being out in 30 degrees all day. Would recommend here as a slightly cheaper hotel but also in walking distance of Louvre! \n",

      "  review_body : This is a small, very basic hotel quite central to many tourist attractions (e.g 15 minute walk to the Orangery and the musee d'orsay). The staff we spoke to had very limited English, and my French is not good either but we managed, until the last night, when the air conditioning unit broke down at about 10,30pm. The issue was the terrible noise it made, meaning neither we, nor the person in the next door room could sleep. The receptionist tried to fix it but could not and told us the electrician would come in the morning. Given there were no free rooms in the hotel, the implication seemed to be that we could either sit in the reception area all night or walk the streets, neither of which seemed very attractive. I insisted that he call the owner, which he did, reluctantly. When the owner camel, some time later, he did manage to dismantle the unit and stop the unit but by this time it was around 2AM, We were not offered so much as a cup of tea while we waited. To date we have received no apology , no refund, no acknowledgement at all of a very bad end to our stay.It is a shame, because until then we had been satisfied enough. Our room was small but comfortable, and reasonably clean. The towels were OK though we did have one day when we had a very frayed hand towel (which we did not complain about). Our room faced the street, which was a little noisy during the day but fine at night and early morning.Because of the poor way we were treated at the end I am giving a poor review.\n",

      "  review_body : This hotel is a lovely hotel right in amongst it, walking distance to most things, and so close to the metro that you have easy access to all of Paris! The reception was up one flight of stairs, but once there the welcome is wonderful, such a lovely team of people running the hotel. They are very helpful & friendly. My room (room 102) was right behind the reception, so I didn't have any more stairs, but also right next to the kitchen, so was pretty noisy early in the morning (6am) as they prepare the breakfast fro 6.30am onwards. There was no noise from the street with the windows shut, and the kitchen noise was a minor thing really as the room was lovely, decent size for Paris, with a comfortable bed & lovely bathroom. The only thing with the bathroom was that the shower water took ages to drain away so you were always standing in the water, but I guess that's just an 'old building' issue. The other thing I wasn't 100% happy about was that I shared my room with a mouse lol. Again, probably being an original old building doesn't help, but perhaps a bit of filler around the skirting boards may solve the problem. The mouse only ran along one wall heading under the door towards the kitchen, so didn't bother me too much, but I was aware of it when getting out of bed lol.Overall, for the price and the location, this hotel would be hard to beat, particularly given how clean it is, and how friendly the staff & owners are. I would definitely stay here again & highly recommend it.\n",

      "  review_body : Let's face it: most of us travelers do not have an unlimited expense account. Some like to save for years to go on one pull-all-the-stops-out, luxury trip of a lifetime. Others, myself included, prefer to travel often and spend as little as possible, while still enjoying reasonable amounts of comfort, safety and convenience. This little hotel checked off all my boxes: it is located a few blocks away from Place de la Concorde, which is really the center of Paris, on a quiet street; a small, friendly, comfortable hotel. The rooms are small, but big enough to sleep in, which was all my daughter and I did there. Everything was clean, cozy and comfortable. Due to a series of unfortunate events we didn't arrive at the hotel until 3am, about 12 hours after scheduled! No worries! The concierge was waiting and the room was clean and ready! Really nothing bad to say about this place except that if you don't like even a flight of stairs or are very large this place may not be a good fit. Thumbs up from me, though!\n",

We booked it because it was very reasonably priced and in a great area of town (close to everything), but our experience when we stayed there was even better than we had hoped. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We were greeted warmly every time we interacted with them and they went out of their way to be helpful. The desk clerks all speak English. The owner was around frequently and although she didn't speak much English, she was always looking to make our stay more comfortable and with my bit of French we got along great. When she saw us walking up to our room with a bottle of wine, she offered us a corkscrew and glasses. And one morning when we were leaving for the day, she let us know that there would be a free concert in the Tuileries garden that evening. Even though this hotel is right in the middle of everything, it was extremely quiet and restful at night. It's like we turned a corner from the busy streets, and suddenly we were in a peaceful, quiet retreat. Regarding the room, it was small but nice and very clean. There was a comfortable mattress and good pillows. Everyday the room was thoroughly cleaned and they always left us new towels. The shower was tiny, but the water pressure was great and there was always plenty of hot water. The air conditioning was the best we've had in a European hotel room - very powerful and easy to adjust. There was a mini fridge in our room, which was a nice surprise. We were extremely happy with our stay and only have positive things to day about Hotel La Sanguine. We will be back!\n",

      "  review_body : I took a solo trip to Paris from Thursday 3/22 to Monday 3/26, and I’m so glad I chose La Sanguine! As a first time tourist, I wanted to see all of the main attractions. La Sanguine was walking distance to nearly everything, including the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, and the Eiffel Tower. For the slightly longer trips, the Madeline subway stop is very convenient. I stayed in room 309, a single that was tiny but very clean with a strong WiFi connection and USB charger for my phone. The hotel offers breakfast for a reasonable price, but I took advantage of the mini-fridge and the small grocery store down the street to save a few Euro. The front desk is staffed 24/7, and they allowed me to store my luggage there after check out so I could take in a few more sites before going to the airport. Overall, I highly recommend this charming little hotel!\n",

      "  review_body : I did not spend the night here, but found it when I needed to store my laptop while visiting the US Embassy. Not only do they provide essential service that nobody else seems to be able to help with, but they do very reasonably – five euros to look after a couple of laptops for two or three hours. They let us sit comfortably at a table to sort out our paperwork when we came back, and served a lovely pot of coffee for the two of us for another five euros. Not many places you can get a nice coffee at that price in Paris these days!One street over from Faubourg Ste. Honorée, this hotel is in a fantastic location for central Paris. Only rated two stars, but from the cleanliness we saw, and the attentiveness of Nicole and her staff, I will be looking this place up next time I need a reasonably priced room in the city.\n",

We always spoke highly of this hotel to our children and wanted to bring them to Paris and stay at Hotel La Sanguine to hopefully experience what we experienced all those years ago. Each morning we were greeted by happy staff and sat down for a wonderful fresh breakfast consisting of croissants, baguettes, fresh fruit, homemade jams, freshly brewed coffee, hot chocolate and fresh juices. This is a small boutique hotel so the rooms are small. We requested a room facing the street which have beautiful french style windows. The location of this hotel is amazing. The area has a lovely feel. It is located near the place de la Madeleine and Metro. Next door is a creperie which we enjoyed a few times during our stay. Lovely brasseries around the hotel and a supermarket close by. We could basically walk to everything. Thank you to the lovely staff and owners and we look forward to returning.\n",

      "  review_body : I generally do not book 2 star hotels, and I would not have booked this one, but I did so without noticing. At issue was the fact that it was Easter weekend and everything was incredibly expensive. La Sanguine stood out as relatively cheap particularly compared to where to its TripAdvisor rating. However, our first impressions were not good, the you have to climb a set of stairs just to get to the reception, and they are not easy stairs. The place looked a little run down, and the at night, the walls looked dirty. The mini-bar fridge looked like it it had been dropped from the roof, and then given a couple of whacks with a sledge hammer for good measure. If my partner's looks could kill, I would not be writing this review.But by the light of day, my impression had changed, on closer inspection the place was very clean if a little worn here and there. The bathroom was very modern, seemingly replaced in the last few years, and the fixtures worked perfectly. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I even came to appreciate the refrigerator as the quietest one I have ever encountered.The location could not have been better, not only was it close to a Metro stop that was easy to get to from the airport, but also walkable to both Champs-Elyssee and the Louvre. And there were plenty of nice eating places in Place Vendome (again close by) or just cheap food right down the street. Not to mention a super market on the same street.Oh, and the internet was great. Watched Netflix with no problemAnyway, by the end of the trip even my partner had to admit the value for the money was great at La Sanguiene, particularly on that weekend. So, the bottom line? My recommendation is two-fold. If you are there for a romantic getaway, and you have some money, then go elsewhere. Given the price of everything else on a romantic getaway (food, entertainment, etc) it seems \"pound foolish\" not to splurge, you may as well go in style. Because I generally fall in this category, I will not come here again.That said, if you really are looking for value, and trying to get to Paris on a budget, look no further. This is a steal compared to value of everything else I have found online and actually stayed at (mostly on business trips).\n",

      "  review_body : Staying at Intercontinental Paris Le Grand during annual food and wine festival at Montmartre became our annual family tradition, and so we visited this hotel again.Check in around noon was not a problem - available room in Opera wing was located. We were assured this was an \"upgrade\" although I would struggle to find any difference from rooms we stayed before, except one thing: This one was renovated recently.If situation before renovation can be described as \"over the top art deco\" then the new design is more sterile and efficient. It is nice to see they dispensed of shower curtain at the bathroom, but it created different problems (see below) and it still leaks on the floor.Room was facing internal courtyard so there was no view whatsoever except the opposite wall - good for privacy I guess, but nothing entertaining.Problem with the shower stems from the same reason it always does - people just don't think designing these things. When one open shower glass partition and reach out to turn on the shower, it immediately starts flowing on your head and the floor. if room service left setting on cold, it can be quite \"refreshing\". Other than that - still solid option to stay in central Paris.\n",

They gave us a nice heart-shaped mousse cake and cookies. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was luxurious with marble and a clawfoot tub. We had a gorgeous view of the opera house with a little cute balcony. We even got 2 free drink passes for waiting on our room.\n",

You always feel taken care of but not uncomfortable due to an overdose of care.I was given a renovated room with separate income with toilet, plenty of storage space and a large bathroom with tub and separate shower. All very new and stylish.The macarons as welcome gift were very much appreciated.The minibar contains a good choice of drinks and a sweet bar.Location is perfect, walking distance from the Champs Elysées, next to the Opera and the main shopping street.Breakfast offers a very extensive choice, including a table with Japanese food. No doubt for the Intercontinental strikes the right balance of service and style for a decent price.The only thing you need to deal with is that the hotel is being renovated,. As the hotel remains open, this may cause some nuisance. In my case, there were works in the bar and it was closed. But don't let this disturb you as you will barely notice it.\n",

It was the last weekend in August and Paris was sweltering, the streets were very quiet with everyone desperately looking for shade so it was an absolute pleasure to repeatedly return to the comfort of this grand building.Check in by Rakan was swift, friendly and professional and he looked after us admirably for the entire weekend. We received an upgrade to a newly refurbished Opera view room, witnessed the nightly dancing on the steps of the Opera whilst enjoying the complimentary fruit and drinks in a perfectly cool atmosphere. The airconditioning was extremely efficient and very quiet ensuring a good night sleep.We booked a Club room and enjoyed the afternoon tea, canapes and pre dinner drinks in our own little oasis. A big thank you goes out to Giles in the Club Lounge who really made sure we had everything we required including a delightful table for dinner in the Cafe de la Paix.Icing on the cake was having an extended checkout and a final celebratory drink in the bar before taking the train back to Deauville. Many thanks to all of the staff who all appear to take massive pride and have good knowledge of the past of this historical building but are also passionate about the future after the current renovations. We will be back in October!\n",

      "  review_body : My wife and I just completed a vacation that included stays in some wonderful five-star properties like Dromoland Castle in Ireland, Hotel El Palace in Barcelona, Hotel María Cristina in San Sebastían, and Le Negresco in Nice just to name a few. We finished at an old friend, The Intercontinental – Le Grand in Paris. I first stayed in this hotel in the 1980s at the recommendation of my father who had stayed there fifty years before, long before it was an Intercontinental. Since then I have stayed there several more times over the years, always before leaving with the desire to return. I have also stayed at many other wonderful hotels in Paris (some among the most famous in the world), there being no shortage of them regardless of budget. Sadly, this stay at Le Grand will be my last. it was the only real disappointment of our trip. The warm welcome I have received on all prior occasions was noticeably absent on this arrival. Having booked a Jr. suite, I asked about an upgrade (as an Intercontinental Ambassador I theoretically get a “guaranteed room upgrade”). “Sorry no!” I could have ONE free breakfast instead. Ah, and I could also have access to the club for 120€/day instead of 150€. Oh well, it is a busy time of year. When we arrived at our \"No view\" (good description) room it reeked of cigarette. I asked for another room. “No, none is available.” Instead they sent an ionizer that they only left in the room for a few hours with marginal or no effect. Fortunately, the chemical smells from the remodeling on other parts of the floor sometimes overwhelmed the cigarette smell. Paris was hot. So was our room. When we asked for the AC to be repaired while we went to dinner they agreed to send the technician. When we returned the drapes had been closed. There was no other noticeable change and the room was still hot despite the AC being at its max position as we had left it. When I called again they offered a fan. The hotel’s public spaces were also uncomfortably hot during all five days of our stay. [In contrast, our friends stayed at a considerably lower priced hotel nearby, the rooms and public spaces of which were delightfully cool.] Though the food was generally good, service in the restaurants and bars was remarkably slow and inattentive even when the servers were instead devoted to social conversation among themselves. To be sure, there are still many among its staff who work hard to make the hotel a great place. But that is no longer the predominant or universal rule it once was. In short, this was a far cry from the five-star experience to which we had become accustomed in prior visits. Moreover, the gross failure to cool public and sleeping spaces during these hot summer days is inexcusable in a hotel claiming that stature and charging what does Le Grand. I am going to miss the wonderful experiences I have had in years past at what used to be a truly wonderful luxury hotel. Sadly, there is nothing now to make it comparable, let alone preferable, to so many other (often much lower-priced) great Paris hotels, some new some old.\n",

      "  review_body : This is my third review for this property, and I can only say good things, despite a small \"hiccup\" with our room, which was quickly resolved. Of course, it would have been much better if the hiccup didn't occur in the first place, but it was quickly addressed and rectified, so all's well ! We were lucky to enjoy the 5th floor executive lounge for what are now it's final days. It will be missed, but apparently the new owners are putting suites (one suite? not sure), in its place, and there will be a new executive lounge on the first floor. I am sure it will be lovely, but nothing like the space it occupies now, with 2 floors and a beautiful view of the roof of the Opera Garnier. The staff at the lounge was exceptional as always. In fact all of the staff at this particular hotel are extraordinary. This has become our favorite hotel in Paris (if not the world), not so much for the rooms (which are wonderful as long as you understand the difference between a classic, supreme, executive room and the various junior suites), not so much for the location (which if you go as a tourist is more than ideal, with enough differing metro lines within a 2-3 block walking distance to take you pretty much anyplace in Paris, as well as several bus lines having stops conveniently all around the hotel), but for the staff. The people working there go out of their way to make you feel welcome. A job well done all around. I do want to give special kudos though to two people, who went out of their way to amend the problem with the room to begin with and to make our stay an exceptionally happy one. Thank you very very much Ignacio and Rosalie. These two people went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. We usually come to this hotel when we have something to celebrate, and as such every time we come here has been more and more memorable.Our room was wonderful, large, a great bed as always, with balconies that had a view of the Eiffel tower when you stepped out, and despite being over a busy street, it was extremely quiet with the windows closed. I am sure that once the renovated rooms are available, they will be nothing short of spectacular. For those that may wonder, elite status was acknowledged, upgrades, gifts, amenities etc ... everything was great. My wife and I are looking forward to our next visit already.\n",

Our AC worked great. It is a beautiful hotel. The lobby and elevators gleam. The wood in the elevator is so well polished, it is like looking in a mirror. We loved sitting in the bar area. We had emailed and asked for a bottle of red wine to be in our room, as we were celebrating our anniversary, not a free bottle, expected to pay for it. They said we could purchase red wine when we got there but that they would provide us a bottle of Champagne. They gave us Champagne, strawberries, and macarons. Thanks, Camilo! We are normal everyday people and probably not their typical guest but everyone we came in contact with treated us great and any question or need we had was handled promptly.

      "  review_body : We stayed 3 nights in May 2019 and for our 50th wedding anniversary and a Provence tour after out stay. We booked our 1st night via our IHG program and selected the Savoring France package that included a dinner, an Executive room and breakfast. We opted up for the Club lounge access on the 5th floor for 150 euro for our firsts day. This is well worth it especially from USA with early morning flight.We used all facets of te hotel from reservations contacts via email and telephone, Club lounge, front desk, Cafe de La paix for 3 breakfasts and 1 dinner, room service and bar. While I appreciate that the hotel is undergoing renovations, our experience was outstanding from the quality of the food, the room and the service. The Club lounge access was especially valuable with the typical US arrival at 8 am in Paris. Georgio and Richard were so friendly and the service and food prior to our early check in at 11:30 was well received. Kudos to Lollita nad Kevin with our reservations. Our waiter for dinner on te 21st was outstanding with great Chablis and Bordeaux with our meals. The best wine and food on our 12 day trip and we had outstanding meals all through Provence.A special thanks to the General Manager Christopher Laure who instills the sincere levels of friendly service into his staff. Everone says Bonjour and can not do enough for you. This was a highlight of our trip and we had a fabulous trip throughout France. So glad that the French people are so friendly and warm to Americans. Always a pleasure to visit France and a great ally to USA.Merci Beaucoup\n",

      "  review_body : IHG should be ashamed having this property as one of their hotels. We only had issues during this stay and nothing pleasant happened at this hotel. From the beginning, we booked this hotel based on the reviews and I have no idea how they were able to get the positive ratings they have.First, the room we were placed in had a horrible view of the central atrium roof and other rooms. You couldn’t see anything of Paris and being a Platinum Ambassador member who was told that this room was an upgrade from what we purchased, I totally expected more. The second room had a better view, but was extremely hot and humid. This hotel advertises that they have air conditioning, but that is absolutely not true. On our way out the first afternoon (around 4pm), we let the front desk know about the AC and also told them of an issue with the iron. When we got back to the hotel, around 10pm, the temperature in the room was hotter than when we left and the same iron was in the room. There was a voicemail on our phone stating both had been fixed, when in actuality neither was completed. I emailed someone that works in the office of the general manager and she worked the next day to find us a new room. The third room was back to the same view as the first room, which again, was not acceptable. So we go back to the front desk and we speak to a manager and he shows us 2 other rooms. We finally settle on our fourth room and they say the AC will definitely work in this room. It’s better than the second room, but not what you would expect if you have AC in the United States. The only way they can actually cool the room to an acceptable temperature was to put a portable “air conditioner” (see pictures attached), of sorts, in the room that we had to fill with ice twice a day. The hotel knows they have issues with cooling the rooms and say it’s due to the renovations that are going on. I tell them that if they can’t get these issues under control during a renovation, then they need to shut down. No guest should have to go through these types of troubles.During our first night in the 4th room, we discover ants in the bathroom. They are in the face cloths, on the sink, and the next morning, all over the floor. Again, we tell the front desk of this issue and they do something the next day to get rid of them. When speaking with the front desk, they mention that they know they have an issue with ants, but it usually only happens with rooms that have trees outside of the windows. How is this acceptable at this caliber of a hotel?On our last night, while packing to leave Paris, I put my backpack on the bed. Ants fell off my backpack onto the bed, likely from where my backpack was sitting on the desk chair. By this time I was completely fed up with this hotel and, with it being our last night, I just waited until the next morning to let them know.One last thing to note is, there is only a half glass wall that is supposed to keep the water from spraying all over the bathroom while taking a shower. The show head was so calcified that water sprayed everywhere and the little glass wall did not keep the water in the tub. Water covered the floor each time we tried to take a shower and the person I was traveling with fell in the bathroom because of the water.Please think twice before booking this hotel, especially while it is undergoing renovations. Per their standards, they are ok knowing that some rooms have ants and that there is a massive problem with the air conditioning system during this process. I’m sure there are far better options for the amount of money this hotel charges.\n",

The bathroom had a bathtub/shower combo with no water pressure from the main shower head and the hand held was at the base of the tub so worthless. The tub itself had a VERY high side that was dangerous to get over. The hotel had the standard hairdryer but no outlet in the bathroom (only an outlet for electric razor). The air conditioning on high barely cooled the room. We were told that because of our tour operator we had a $100 euro credit to use in the hotel but were not told that if we tipped a bartender that was not included in the comp. There are many more, smaller boutique hotels with excellent personalized service that far surpass this hotel...good for business meetings/conventions I suppose.\n",

The 3 great assets of the hotel: 1-Its location, 2-Its staff (extremely courteous and professional) and 3-Cafe La-Paix which serves an excllent breakfast That said, there are few reasons why I would not give it 5/5 rating 1- The rooms lack mirrors (Ours which is supposedly an upgrade) had a single mirror in the bathroom!?2- Lighting in the rooms is really inadequate. The dressing area by the wardrobes had a very faint light, and to add insult to injury it was on a motion sensor!! I mean for a 5 star hotel REALLY?! It I stay montionless for 10 seconds I am in the dark and have to waive my arm! Note: This is where the hotel safe is located, so be careful not to forget valuables in the dark (Which I almost did).3- We asked for a Double room, what we got is Two single beds pushed next to each others!4- As an Intercontinental Ambassador for many years, and IHG Spier Elite, celebrating a very special occasion; I was hoping for at least a room with a view or an upgrade of some meaningful way, That did not happen, we got a room that overlooks other rooms?! This was in stark difference to the Intercontinental Amstel Amsterdam which we used last year, it was BRILLIANT.\n",

      "  review_body : This was my first stay as an IHG Ambassador and me and the other half were very well looked after by everyone at the hotel.Although our room wasn’t ready when we arrived at 3:30 pm, the hotel had generously given us a double upgrade to a junior suite which added a special touch to our anniversary celebrations. We had booked club lounge access so were quite happy to relax in the lounge as the room was prepared.The club lounge at this hotel is excellent with champagne, wine, beer, soft drinks, tea and coffee available all day. Premium spirits were available in the evening although they didn’t have slimline tonic. The afternoon tea service was very good with a nice selection of sandwiches and cakes. The evening canapés service was also very good although on one night all of the options were fish and seafood which the other half doesn’t eat. The breakfast selection in the lounge is more than adequate and I liked the branded smoothies and yoghurts. There was a limited hot buffet but it was possible to order other items.The junior suite was very well maintained and large with a king-size bed, sitting area, large bathroom with separate shower and bath as well as a large walk-in wardrobe. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows were terrible, far too thin.The hotel is in a lovely location directly opposite the Opera, about 15 minute walk from the Louvre and about 15 minute walk to the Champs-Elysées. \n",

      "  review_body : A friend took me to Le Bar once and so I took a friend there to impress her. We went to the ladies room to wash our hands before eating and a woman stole my Authentic Vintage Burberry Scarf (I spent 9 years saving for it). I was immediately shocked and told the staff at the coat check in and the waiters. None of them helped. They literally ignored me. Then I went to the customer service desk and asked them to call security or look at the cameras. They mad me wait so long and did nothing. I went all the way to paris for Le Grand Hotel experience and they did not even give me a second. I was showing how disappointed I had been. I even told the security guard by the entrance to not let a lady out if she had Burberry scarf on. When I finally saw the woman and went to her and said, 'that's my scarf.\" she said no it's not. I said yes it is bc my tag is still on it and I can smell my perfume. She immediately ran out the hotel and I told the security but he said sorry I can't leave my spot. I was so mad!! If they had just given me a minute they could have stopped her before she left. She spent almost an hour at the hotel walking around with my scarf around her neck while I waited for customer service to do anything. They did nothing! I came home very sad and it was a $500 loss. I then called Le Grand Hotel copious times to complain but no one even attended my call. Then I had my cousin from London call them too. But no one attended his call either. I cannot believe for all the love I gave to Le Grand hotel...they gave me nothing in return except disappointment! Very sad. I was in a country where I knew no one. Didn't even know how to call the police. And they just ignored me and gave the thief enough time to prance around and then run out!! The owe me $500 to say the least!\n",

Hotel atmosphere and decoration were warmth, Clean and comfortable room and friendly and cheerful staff. At checking in where I was attended by a friendly and cheerful Receptionist Rakan, a lady name Svenja Dallner, Guest Relations came by to greet me and I was taken a back where she could recalled 3 years ago she was the one that attended to my checking-in. Wow what a great memory she has ! Svenja was the Receptionist 3 years ago. She truly deserved her career advancement. I also found that the Hotel Management are hands on with guest services, leading by example. Credit goes to the Hotel General Manager for leading the team to True Hospitality.

      "  review_body : Although I don’t get to stay in Paris very often (once or twice a year), I do try to stay, even if just for a couple of nights, at the Intercontinental Paris Le Grand. It is one of my absolute favorite IHG properties because of the fantastic club lounge. The staff are just superb and cannot do enough for you. We stayed over the weekend of 18th to 20th Jan 2019. We opted to check-in at the hotel front desk since there was no queue. They had very nicely upgraded my room, though the room was not quite ready yet as we arrived earlier than expected (1PM). They did offer to find another room that was ready if we didn’t want to wait for the larger suite, which was very nice. Given we knew about the excellent lounge, we opted to wait and visit the lounge. Our suitcases were taken from us and we went up to the 5th floor. On arrival at the Club lounge, we were greeted like old friends by Gilles and immediately offered a hot drink or a glass of champagne, and we opted for the latter. Gilles was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic so we knew we were in great hands. Frequently, the staff came around and offered a top up, or asked if we wanted any snacks or nibbles. Sooner after, a member of staff approached with our key cards and let us know our room was ready. We went to the room to find our suitcases had beaten us there - great! The suite was immaculate. We unpacked and went back to the lounge. We returned to the room later on to find a beautiful presentation of canapés, champagne on ice, fresh fruit, fruit juices and a handwritten card from Christophe, the General Manager, welcoming us back to the hotel, were left on the table! A second card also wished us a happy anniversary – it was our anniversary, but I did not mention this to anyone and neither had my partner. I don’t remember if I had selected this as our “reason for stay” when booking (there is a dropdown box when booking with IHG to say whether it’s a business trip, weekend getaway, etc), or this was noted from our last visit at the same time the previous year. Either way, what a lovely unexpected gesture!Overall, it’s the club lounge that really makes this hotel extra special – all the staff in the lounge should be extremely proud of the service they provide, and it really is a boutique hotel within a hotel. They anticipate your needs, know your preferences, and do everything they can to ensure you have a great stay. I was particularly pleased to see that they have re-added the eggs benedict to the a la carte options at breakfast, which I ordered both mornings in the lounge and it was excellent. The food in the club lounge is a real treat – a large selection of freshly made sandwiches, salad, canapes, pastries, cakes and hot main course dishes are available and change throughout the day and evening. Thank you to each and every member of the club lounge staff for another wonderful weekend stay at this beautiful hotel. We can’t wait to come back!\n",

The hotel was having their exterior walls renovated during my stay, but we didn't feel disturbing, except that we didn't get a good front picture of the hotel.The location just can't be better, steps from the Opera. The room was luxury furnished with a large shower bathroom containing separate bath and shower room. We were upgraded upon arrival to get a higher room with a partial view to the Eiffel tower. Later on, they sent up a card with a champagne and tweets for our special occasion. The breakfast was not included. We didn't had breakfast there but we headed to the cafe in the morning for two cappuccinos. The coffee and the service are both top notch. Upon departure, we were asked about whether we had a good stay and everything was indeed really great. A minor issue was that it was really difficult to find a room for the first time, at least my room. I recommend this hotel and would definitely visit again.\n",

(Thank you for the well-stocked in-room tea service - rare, we often find, at high end hotels in Paris and a lifesaver for two under-the-weather travelers). The management surprised us with a gift as repeat visitors, a gesture that can be typical of international chains that do such tracking, but which over 30 years of frequent travel we rarely see in Parisian boutique hotels. (The European respect for anonymity notwithstanding, after 3-4 visits one would appreciate at least a small acknowledgement at reception for ones patronage. I could name names -a lot of them. ) This was a quick 3-day stay, bundled on Expedia, so we didn’t expect too too much this time around. Room 4228 was small but comfortable and quiet despite the construction all around us. We will not hesitate to return.\n",

      "  review_body : My husband and kids and I recently stayed for 10 nights at this hotel. The hotel was fabulous. A word of caution....it's currently undergoing renovation so there are areas of the hotel that are not quite up to par. Our room overlooked the 'courtyard' and I must say it was an eye sore....old astroturf and rusted metal....not the greatest. The room itself was great...it was very large for european standards. The bathroom was large and very well appointed. There was a large walk-in closet which was nice to have for a longer stay. The beds were extremely comfortable. I believe ours was one of the rooms that had been renovated. They gave us complimentary water bottles every day and refreshed our coffee and tea if needed. The only negative for us was that the room was somewhat dark but it was probably the location of it. There also weren't a ton of outlets to charge things and we were specifically told to not use the Shaver Charger in the bathroom to charge anything else...even if using a converter. (odd). They even said the hairdryer should be plugged in to another outlet so I ended up using the hairdryer by plugging it in to the plug by the desk. It really wasn't a problem but just odd. We always take a power strip with us so we can plug in more than one thing at a time to charge so a limited number of outlets wasn't a problem for us. The staff was wonderful. When we checked in our room was not ready so they gave us complimentary drink cards for the lobby and bar. We checked back a few hours later and it was still not ready so we received another round of free drinks. The concierge was helpful in booking tickets to the catacombs and eiffel tower. We had drinks and dinner in the lobby area and the service was great and food was good. It's a lovely place to sit. The outstanding thing about this hotel is the location. It is 5 minutes from Gallerie Lafayette, 10 minute walk to Louvre/Tuillerie, 10 minutes to place Vendome, across the street from the Metro.....I could go on. There are many, many wonderful cafes and shops in very close proximity and anyone would be hard pressed to find a better location. All in all it was a great hotel, great service and great location. We would definitely return.\n",

      "  review_body : The only things stopping the hotel from getting five stars are the fact it took over two days (and several attempts) to get an answer to a question I needed to ask before our stay, and a 7am fire alarm on Sunday morning. It wasn't a drill, as we were not expected to go out, and reception said 'oh, we will turn it off' but that took a little while...Otherwise, a great little hotel. Rooms small (but this is Paris, and it is a great price for what you get here), but wonderfully decorated. Incredibly comfy bed. A really lovely bathroom with a fantastic shower, and Hermes toiletries. I would stay again!\n",

      "  review_body : Overall: I booked this hotel last minute (as my usual go to spots where full). The price for the season was reasonable. The hotel is discreet. The location is good if you need to be beside opera. Arrived late but was still able to order reasonably fresh/healthy food. (Saved me from ordering a late night meal on uber-eat or deliveroo). It's pity the internet was slow as otherwise I would consider going again. Pros:- Good value for money. - Very quiet room (Top floor) - Reasonably comfortable bedding. - Nice bathroom with a bathtub - Warm & Professional Receptionist at night. - Quick check-out - Late night food offering is small but nice. Bread is nice quality. Cons:- Very slow internet (not good enough for a conference call or to download a heavy document) - Had to connect through my 4G. - Small room (relatively normal for Paris) - No place to even open a luggage. - Poor lighting the bathroom : Making it hard to shave.\n",

It wasn't a huge room but perfect for 2 people with a nice table to sit and drink wine by as we did most nights. The staff were incredibly friendly and were really helpful when it can to finding near by restaurants or accommodating a late checkout. I couldn't believe the breakfasts. I expected some pastries and maybe some fruit but not table service, fresh eggs however you want them and the most pleasant staff in the whole of Paris. We we quite late down to breakfast, literally arriving as it should have finished but they accommodated us and still made us some great eggs even though they were busy with other guests as well. I couldn't have asked for a better stay and would stay here any time again. Loved it!!\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here for 3 nights for our Wedding Anniversary. It was a Travelzoo deal with a superior room including breakfast and flights. We had booked the bus to get us to the Opera but ended up on the train and metro, no fault of the hotel and arrived around 6pm. We were shown to our room on the 4th floor, there was a lift with enough room for our cases and us.The room was beautifully decorated and the bed was firm enough for us with a choice of pillows. Wardrobe facilities were good but may be a little stretched if staying over a week. There was also a safe in here to use.The en-suite was adequate and had both a rain shower and a handheld shower, water heated up quickly and plenty of shower gel to use.The breakfast was good, continental with eggs how you like them. The staff were very accommodating and pleasant as well as very helpful. There was someone there 24/7 so no keys needed to get in and out just the card for your roomIt’s in a great location as under 15 mins walk to the river and round the corner from the Opera house. The Roissybus bus is minutes away at the top of the street and €12.50 each, get tickets either from the Tourist info places at the airport or on board the bus, don’t bother pre booking, for a journey that takes around a hour and that is the only stop so quick, about the same time as a taxi.There are plenty of places to eat round there including a very nice patisserie that does savoury snacks and salads to take away just up the same street.Would defiantly stay again next time we are in Paris....\n",

      "  review_body : The best thing about this hotel is the staff. They are extremely polite,friendly and helpful. We wanted to explore Paris and they were happy to book trips and guide to locations. Word of warning (not about the hotel) if you are travelling on the sncf transport system ensure you stamp you paid ticket before boarding. We were fined and no allowance for tourist when all the signs are in French to instruct you to do this. The conductors in the train are actually quite thuggish and relentless until you pay. The hotel staff were very sorry about this experience but it did give me a poorer view of Paris. The hotel is very boutique and for English folks reading this all I can say is the rooms reminded me of George Clark’s amazing spaces. The bathroom almost feels like a wardrobe and I would say more applicable for a single room rather than a couple. There is very little privacy in the bathroom however It is very clean. There are a few things that could could do with an update as the side table was broken and the curtain tie on one side was on the floor. The maid service was good with turn down on an evening. It was an enjoyable relaxed stay but not a room to spend time in due to the size. Breakfast was lovely and the omelettes are just perfect! The trip to Versailles was the best experience and I don’t think you need a tour guide to do this it was well advised by the hotel staff we made our Own way round and it is just breathtaking. I would also recommend exploring Versailles town lovely places friendly folks and traditional. An enjoyable trip overall!\n",

      "  review_body : The Maison Athenee is a boutique hotel of only 20 rooms decorated in the style of the old Paris Opera. Imagine red velvet, gleaming mahogany, glimmering gold-framed mirrors, sparkling crystal and softly glowing lamps. Step down into a divine little dining room, surrounded by photographs of stars of bygone days - I only recognised Maria Callas - but they were gorgeous and funny. The Manager, Pierre, welcomed us personally and introduced us to Hugo who gave us a map and tips on the local area as we were at the hotel too early to check in. They stored our luggage for us and gave us a lovely cappuccino before we set off on our first sight-seeing trip of our all-too-short stay in this wonderful city. Breakfast is served in a lovely dining room where you can select from a range of cold dishes and also have eggs prepared any which way you like. We were lucky to have ours personally prepared both mornings by Pierre. Croissants - the most magnificent croissants imaginable. Pierre rates them as the best in Paris. Made by the best baker in Paris no less! Absolutely exquisite. Melt in the mouth. You must try them.\n",

Instead of a counter like most hotels have, they have a very chic desk with two chairs. You really feel like you just crashed into someone living room in Paris. My room was small but it was so beautiful with the drape around the bed. It looks like you step in a doll house:) The bed was very comfortable. It was like sleeping in a huge soft pillow. I had the best sleep there. After traveling around Israel I was too tired and i was able to relax there. The bathroom was gorgeous. I love the titles in the shower.Location location location . You are basically in the middle of Paris. I was able to walk almost everywhere. I spent 3 days in Paris and I only took the metro one time. If you don't want to take public transportation or taxi stay here. It is like 15 minutes from the Louvre and i was able to walk to Montmartre too! They are a lot of restaurants around . Too many places to choose. I highly recommend this hotel.\n",

I had a Deluxe room and it worked perfectly for me and the AC and WIFI worked well for me. I travel regularly for business and this hotel will be my new first choice when thinking of a place in Paris. My first night I went to a concert with Meloday Gardot and the Olympia Theater is not far around the corner and of course the Metro is also steps away.

      "  review_body : We booked this hotel due to location and budget. It was close to multiple metro stations and one RER station which made it convenient to get anywhere in the city. We actually arrived from the airport via the RER train line so it was pretty easy to get to the hotel on foot once we got to the Auber station (i.e. no pricey taxis!)The hotel staff is very nice. The breakfast was included in our rate and although small, it was satisfactory and nice to have a meal that we didn't have to think about to start the day. I especially enjoyed the cappuccinos and croissants. On the last day we requested to have breakfast in our room and we really enjoyed that, I wish we had done that sooner in our trip. If you're visiting Paris for the shopping, the location of this hotel is outstanding. We were steps away from Printemps, Galeries Lafayette and many other stores.A couple of the downsides...A/C is controlled by hotel staff but we didn't realize that until sweating through the first night. Once we asked them to turn it down for us, it was much better.We did not receive consistent towel refills. Sometimes we received only large towels and very rarely did we receive washcloths but I know those are rare in Europe.Our room included an outdoor patio but our upstairs neighbors liked to throw their trash and cigarette butts down on it so we never really used it, while not the fault of the hotel, worth noting as you're choosing your room type.Room is small but this is also the only place in Paris we stayed so I don't have a point of reference, again just worth noting.Would likely not stay again but only because now that we have been to Paris I have a better idea of the area that would have suited our needs and interests better. However for this arrondissement, this was a good choice.\n",

The hotel itself is located very centrally in a quiet road just off the main streets next to the Printemps shopping area and a short walk from the Tuileries park. Our room was clean, well equipped and had a small secret patio area where we enjoyed a glass of champagne amongst the green foliage!

The beds were extremely comfortable, the decor engaging and the location unmatched. I love the personal touch of a handwritten note in every room, welcoming each guest. My room (102) faced the street, but the Rue Caumartin is not a particular bustling thouroughfare, so I had no trouble sleeping at all, in spite of the fact that I am an extremely light sleeper. Although I would probably try a different hotel the next time in Paris for the sake of variety, I have enthusiastically recommended The Maison Athenee to all my Francophile friends; it was worth every euro I paid.\n",

      "  review_body : My parents and I were very disappointed with our recent stay at Maison Athenee. We stayed there for two nights at the end of a 10 day long trip around France and were looking forward to a comfortable stay in a 4 star hotel. Unfortunately, we received the opposite. On our first morning, my room did not have any hot water. I was told that they would contact the technician but my room did not have hot water until mid-afternoon, which made showering that morning impossible. Upon returning to my room at 3:30pm, after a long day of touring around, I found that my room had not yet been cleaned, the bed was still unmade, the bathroom had not been cleaned or towels replaced. I had to request that the room be made up twice before it finally happened at 5pm. And even after being made up, the complimentary water bottles were not replaced in my room, which meant I was forced to drink the water out of the mini fridge, for which I was charged. The next morning, I again woke to no hot water in my shower. My parents, who luckily had had hot water the first morning, also had no hot water on the second morning. I called the front desk several times to no avail. I then left my room to have breakfast in the restaurant downstairs while I waited for the water to be fixed, and was surprised to see that on Eastern morning, with a hotel full of guests, only TWO people were working in the entire hotel - one woman at the front desk and one man who was expected to be cooking breakfast and waiting on everyone's tables at the same time (not to mention also helping guests that were arriving and departing with their luggage). Unsurprisingly, I waited almost 30 minutes to even receive a place setting. By the time I finally finished breakfast and got back to my room, my hot water had been fixed, but I only had 20 minutes left until I had to check out and leave for the airport. So I again was unable to shower. Although the staff was well aware that I basically stayed in a dirty room with no hot water for the majority of my stay, I was not offered any discount off the price of my stay, nor did they even so much as comp my breakfast or my single drink at the bar the night prior. Nor did they provide any compensation to my parents, whose room was also not made up until 5pm and who also had no hot water on day 2 of our stay. Needless to say, I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and I would strongly advise others to do the same.\n",

Please keep this a secret!I will definitely come back with my family early 2018 just to show them. The place is as much of an experience as Paris itself. Charming, unique and stylish.

Well we were not disappointed we booked a stay for our 25th wedding anniversary.A smaller hotel but full of character the breakfast was lovely the staff were brilliant and so hard working and there for your every need, polite and full of helpful information.The hotel is situated down a small road with various places to eat ( a lovely Italian pizza restaurant called San Giorgio a few doors door, a must to visit ) its a few minutes walk to the main shops and aren't there a lot of shops ( never seen so many handbags in my life ). The room were very clean in fact the whole hotel was spotless. As a rule I am very particular where I stay and don't give praise unless it is well and truly earned but 'Maison Athenee' is wonderful place to stay in Paris. And we will certainly be returning in the not so distant future. Thank you for a lovely stay.\n",

      "  review_body : My husband and i recently stayed at the Maison Athenee for 8 nights. We were absolutely delighted with our stay from start to finish. As other reviewers have said, staff here are exceptional- recalling our room number for breakfast each morning (as well as our breakfast orders), greeting us warmly, and assisting us in making reservations, etc. The hotel is remarkably quiet and relaxing- there are always lovely scented candles burning. One thing we liked it that the rooms are attended to twice daily, so after returning from dinner we came back to a freshly made up room, which was very nice to return to. The rooms we had on the 5th floor was small but functional and stylish. My husband and I are walkers and were able to walk to everything we wanted to see from this hotel... from the Marche aux Puces in Saint Ouen to the Eiffel Tower, to the Catacombs. Check in and check out were a breeze.\n",

Having ditched a flop house despite the added expense we found a beautifully appointed and comfortable room. As mentioned by other reviewers the staff is consistently friendly and helpful. We acquired what we think was the last available room one flight up and facing the street. My husband is a very light sleeper and did not find the noise from the street to be loud or troublesome. We are already discussing returning right here on our next trip to Paris. Merci beaucoup Maison Athenee. \n",

Comfortable beds, quiet room (even with a room that faced the street), and good quality bathroom fixtures. Can not speak more highly of the staff; they were friendly, very helpful and fluent in both English and French. A big highlight was the location of the Hotel, so central, it was incredibly easy to walk to almost any location we needed to get to in a very short time; especially well located to some amazing restaurants (60 second walk up the nearby laneway). Lastly I would be amiss if I did not highlight the regal, refined, and yet almost cheeky decor of this hotel - it was amazing!

      "  review_body : I'd like to echo the praise offered by others about the staff. Francis and Sam were engaging and happy to make us feel welcome. Our room was nice but the shower was a bit tricky. The rain shower style head was not aligned properly with the tub (ran onto a ledge or counter looking space) so it created water on the floor but it wasn't cause for complaint, just a bit of care while washing up. I for one liked the smoking room option even though I didn't get a chance to use it and I'm not a regular smoker. I had cigars but walked with outside them rather than smoke inside. Even so, I didn't feel the hotel smelled of smoke at all. The bar / lounge area was neat and stocked well. Sam was always ready to pour and the wasabi nuts were a nice touch. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but we flirted with the morning room service option which was a nice perk for those that want it. The mini bar in our fridge was tempting but we held off. We stayed three nights and would gladly return. \n",

      "  review_body : My husband and I stayed at Maison Athenee for a few days in late June/July on vacation. I am hesitant to give it an average rating, as the staff really was exceptionally kind and helpful. The main positive was the staff. Also, the bed was very comfortable and the hotel was quiet. It's also very close to all tourist attractions. The negatives were that the opera / dark burgundy design was not for me and the carpets in the rooms seemed especially worn. I personally did not enjoy the Hermes bath products either, though others might. There is a smoking room downstairs which can't seem to help waft upstairs, so our room smelled of cologne and cigarettes. We ordered breakfast, and the eggs were inedible, which seemed shocking for Paris.I think for the right person, looking for a comfortable quiet place to sleep with attentive staff, this would be a great pick. Was not for me.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here for 4 nights for my wife's 40th birthday. I booked a superior room which although not particularly big was sufficient considering we were in central Paris (where space is obviously at a premium).The room was understated and classy, and the bed itself was very comfortable and the bed linen felt of very high quality (almost silk-like). The only (minor) criticism of the room is that the wardrobe was only half-length so my wife couldn't hang her long dresses properly (as the bottom part had drawers/ minibar).The hotel was within 5 min walk of several train stations however we walked to many locations as it was quicker in some cases (as long as you're reasonably fit). A particularly nice touch was that they delivered breakfast to your room on request (at no charge), which was ideal when we wanted to get ready for the day ahead and not have to sit downstairs for breakfast. You could choose specifically what you wanted on a menu card which then left on the door the night before. They always delivered it promptly to our room on a silver service tray at a time of our choosing which was great,The service overall was excellent, as they always made an effort to greet us when we left and came back each day (sometimes it was very late at night too).Overall we would highly recommend this hotel for a central stay in Paris which is well located and reasonably priced (compared to other boutique-style hotels).\n",

      "  review_body : I've been to Paris a few times, in different areas and accommodation styles (boutiques, brand chains, airbnb) and so far Hotel Maison Athenee has been the best.Yes the rooms are small, but so are a lot of places in Paris if you want character in where you're staying. If you have one of the larger suitcases, I would recommend going one room size up, unless you're very good at unpacking, hanging your items, etc. Apart from that no other complains, the hotel was charming, the beds were very comfortable, quiet, good adjustable room temperature and the service was impeccable. That is what sets this hotel apart from all others I've been - everyone is just so nice. They go out of their way to make sure you have an enjoyable visit and it doesn't feel impersonal. The service extends from the front desk to housekeeping who did a great job cleaning our room and making sure everything was tidy. Even if this is a 4-star, they even make it a point to close your curtains at night, so sort of a turn down service. Sam, Pierre, too many names, not all we caught to call out but everyone we've encountered has been great, so thank you for making our stay such a pleasant one.\n",

We'd stayed in the Hotel Des Arts across the road but a lack of aircon on the hottest night ever in France (according to the BBC) made it unbearable. We booked the hotel through LateRooms before 7am, and they were able to sort us a room out before 9am.Rooms were everything you would expect. The bed was comfy enough and it was spacious enough. We were on the top floor and despite the lift being very small (it would have real problems hitting its maximum occupancy of 4 people), we never found ourselves waiting for it.Little noisy in the corridors during the daytime due to cleaning staff but a trip to Paris isn't one for long lie ins so wasn't overly bothered by that.Location was fantastic. All major places in Paris were within 20 mins on the metro, and it had a wonderful ability to be hidden down a back street bring peace and quiet, yet 30 seconds walk from a busy centre. Plenty to do in this area with lots of bars, cafes and ice cream shops. Bars were pricy but its a major Euro capital so what would you expect?\n",

We could hardly fit three carry-on size suitcases and still have room to move. Bathroom was tiny but had great water pressure. The lift is also very, very small (max 2 people, or 1 person with luggage). View out of window was an interior courtyard, so very boring. Air conditioning worked well on two hot days in Paris.

      "  review_body : We traveled with our child to Paris 2 weeks ago. Hotel Corona Opera is a fantastic hotel with a great staff, décor, is centrally located in a nice quiet area of the 9th quarter. We arrived earlier than check in from an overseas flight and were in desperate need of a nap, as was our child. The desk staff and housekeeping staff worked quickly to get us our room as soon as possible to get settled and relax. That 1st evening we walked the quarter to see what was available for food and to get a feel for the area. The location is so perfect because its close to metro stations, shopping and every food choice you could want. You can walk to the Louvre, and get to any attraction by walking or a short metro ride. The hotel itself is tucked away in a quiet corridor and was very quiet at night. You are welcomed into the hotel by wonderful staff, and classic Parisian décor (beautiful chandeliers in both the reception area, and the breakfast area, modern yet classic character). The elevator is small but workable, not a big deal. Its an old \"charactered\" building so a huge elevator would ruin the nice spiral staircase in the middle of the building. The breakfast area is nicely spaced out and offers a good selection of hot and continental foods...Traveling with a child we were pleasantly surprised to see pancakes as an option with real maple syrup! Other options were soft scrambled eggs, breakfast sausage, cold cereals, hot cereals to make, yogurts, fruit, juices, coffee, tea, breads & pastries, and meats and cheeses, we didn't leave hungry. Our room was on the 5th floor in the front of the hotel, and again, it was quiet inside the hotel and outside at night. The room we had was for 3, so we had a king bed (2 twins together), and a separate twin. There was still plenty of room overall considering there were 3 of us. In the room there was a TV, desk with chair, fridge, coffee pot station, a closet, safe, and a nice bathroom with a deep tub, and a nice shelf to store your toiletries. Also in the room were plenty of electrical outlets. We had 3 phones, a computer and hair tools to use each day so at any given time we had about enough outlets to charge or use what we needed. The hotel, and room was very clean too, and the beds were comfy.Back to the staff: cant say enough about them! on our 3rd day there we had to confirm a tour in another location of France. We were on our way out for the day and we couldn't confirm the tour due to being on hold. The desk staff took our next destination info, and told us to go enjoy the day, and that they would confirm our tour for us. AMAZING service!!. We got back after dinner that night, we had a full confirmation for our next destination tour and we were all set. Great Hotel, Great People, Location Location Location!, and a Great Value. Our family was very satisfied.\n",

      "  review_body : I travel to Paris every year for a few weeks and always stay in the 9th arrondissement as it is very central to all major points in the city. A few years ago I decided to try this hotel and it exceeded all my expectations. I've been a regular customer since and highly recommend this place!The rooms are small and cozy. Amazingly comfortable clean bed! Downstairs there is a cute breakfast buffet. Even though the hotel is on a very busy street (the intersection of rue Montmartre and Grands Boulevards), it's very quiet inside as all the windows overlook a closed courtyard. You literally can't beat the location! Right around the corner there's a metro station (lines 8 & 9), bus stops, cabs, numerous restaurants, even small grocery stores. It's all within \"arm reach\"! If you like to walk, this hotel is definitely for you. Opera house, Grands Magasins, Palais Royal, Louvre, Place Vendome, etc... are all within a walking distance from here. But what really makes you want to keep returning here is the hotel's incredibly friendly and helpful staff. I want to say a special thank you to Jerome and Pasqua for being so accomodating, professional, punctual and super helpful! You two are the best!\n",

The hotel staff was very helpful & friendly, also helped us book a taxi to the train station the day of our departure.

The entrance is located within a gated courtyard—which was a nice feature but difficult to get dropped off by vehicle transportation. It was about a 100-yard walk from the gate (really not a huge issue unless you have a great deal of luggage). The staff was friendly and accommodating. Rooms were nice. The elevator was small and the staircase was narrow—making it difficult to climb with luggage. Overall, it was an enjoyable stay.\n",

      "  review_body : I wrote a review for this hotel five years ago. Although I don't write many reviews nowadays I felt I had to write another review for this hotel because, for us, it is perfect. We stayed, as last time, in the luxury suite but this time in August. Our suite had already been refurbished in 2013; I particularly love luxurious bathrooms. The suite has a shower over the bath, and two wash basins with a huge mirror along the whole wall. There are tea and coffee making facilities and a mini fridge. The two rooms are spacious with a sliding door on either side of the rooms so one can slide one or both shut when required. There was a Juliette balcony for each room and each room has a large TV. One negative reviewer showed a photograph of the view over a roof from their room; we had the same view but I don't know what they expect in the heart of Paris. It had the merit that no-one from a building on the other side of the road could see in to our rooms, even when we had the lights on. The suite was lovely and peaceful so one could get a good nights sleep.We found the reception staff very helpful and the luggage storage area is right next to the reception desk. We were given tags for our bags for security. Breakfast was also perfect for us with everything we like including fresh fruit salad, scrambled eggs and sausages. The building is one hundred years old and the lift is small but one should be grateful that there is a lift at all. We loved our experience at the Hotel Corona and if we come to Paris again we wouldn't look at any other hotel. We paid 120 euros per night for the three of us - a bargain price One usually gets a better price by booking directly with the hotels and August is a cheaper month to visit Paris anyway.\n",

      "  review_body : Stayed with seven girlfriends for four nights. Check in was seamless and we went to our rooms. Unfortunately one room had a double bed and a single and we requested all singles. The hotel moved the girls concerned to a singles room the following day. The room I was in was small but had everything we needed and the bathroom was well equipped with lovely white towels, hairdryer and complimentary toiletries. There was a tv in our room but we didn’t use it. There was a safe in the wardrobe which was useful for stashing our valuables. There was also a fridge with water, orange juice etc. There were plenty of plug points for all the recharging we needed. The windows opened which was good as I do not like the sealed units you get in some hotels. The beds were comfy and I slept well. Breakfast was the usual continental style, fruit, yogurt, cereals and lots of cheese, ham and croissants. There was also scrambled egg and sausages. Lots of juices were available and plenty of tea and coffee. \n",

      "  review_body : My daughter, granddaughter and I just returned from a week in Paris. It was a \"girls\" celebration for my 70th birthday. Three generations together visiting a city I love ❤️. We stayed at the Hotel Corona Opera for 6 nights. We could not have chosen a better hotel, location or concierge, Jerome. Jerome made the Hotel Corona Opera one of the best places I have ever stayed. He always had a welcoming smile. His advice and recommendations were \"spot on\". Though the room was small it was adequate for our needs. Plenty of hot water for showers and the AC cooled us. It was very hot in Paris during our visit!Breakfast was exactly what we needed to get the day started. When we came down to the dining area the tables were invitingly set. Choices for breakfast included scrambled eggs served daintily in glasses, bacon , croissants, pastries, fruit, yogurt, cereal, meats and cheese, and of course wonderful coffee. My granddaughter's high point was the Nutella! Mine was the croissants and my daughter's the pastries.While the hotel was a little apart from the tourist locations it was centrally located for us to walk to almost everything. We were able to walk to the Opera house, Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, the Seine, Sacre Coeur, and more. The Hop On/ Hop Off bus even had a stop a half block away. When we did take the Train to Versailles the Metro was a half block away. We learned the Metro very easily. It is an inexpensive way to get around and easy to navigate. Restaurants were plentiful, casual and more formal. Everything you could want to eat.Our week went by very quickly. We were sad to leave. We look forward to our next visit and hopefully to seeing Jerome again!\n",

      "  review_body : Dear Manager, My parents just came back from the trip from France and they spent 7 nights there. It was first time to travel to France for my parents and they were there for their niece's wedding party. They don't speak both English and French, but as our family policy, whenever we go abroad we respect the culture and people there and at least try to say \"Hello\" and \"Thank you\" in local language. According to my mother, she hate to say like Black hotel employee at reception (maybe his family roots is from Africa) she didn't remember his name though, but whenever she said to him \"Bon Jour\" in morning with her full smile face, he ignored and never replied to her. I don't know the reason why he never replied to her, but she said it was very disappointed. I consider hotel reception is the face and symbol of the hotel and If his attitude was on purpose, I'd recommend him to study what hospitality is again. If he changes his attitude by race or nationality, I'd judge him he's uneducated and unsophisticated and wonder the hotel hiring like him is also have same idea. As a hotelman he was not professional enough and the problem is he doesn't notice his problem. I usually don't write this kind of feedback, however my parents had a very good time except for that. So I'm writing this for his future and also hotel development. Sincerely,Sonoko from Japan\n",

Luckily, we found the wonderful Hotel Corona Opera, which is centrally located in Paris surrounded by endless choices of dining and right around the corner of the Grand Boulevards metro station.Our room for 4, was actually spacious with a split bathroom and a living room that converted to a double bed, and a separate double bedroom. The room was comfortable, clean and seemed updated.We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast, and found the choices to be very good for a breakfast!

You can get much better, cheaper fare on the street nearby. They arranged transportation for us from the airport. It was awful. The driver couldn't find us for 45 minutes, and then he refused to turn on the air conditioning of his old beat up van because he was low on gas.

Thankfully I stayed at 2nd floor, I saw an older couple struggling to take their luggage up in evening and receptionist didn't even propose to help. He was alone in evening, no other staff available. Carpet is soo old and dirty, bathtub curtain smelled bad. Ovoid this hotel! I was surprised of the good rating, maybe the location at 800m from the department stores helps with the score but don't be fooled, don't sacrifice your conform for location, metro is fast and can take u everywhere. \n",

We stayed at the Hotel Corona Opera from June 17-20,2017. Under the circumstances and taking the into consideration the price/value , it was a superb deal. While the rooms are small ( in most of Europe as well as here) and the Elevator was tiny, the location is excellent!We were very close to a Metro Station - Grand Boulevards. From there we went to all the major tourist sites. The 3 day unlimited Metro Card is well worth it! There are many restaurants and shops in the area of the Hotel Corona for all price ranges. The Hotel Staff at the Corona, especially Front Desk were all friendly , warm and helpful . As in most of Europe , they are multi lingual . We spoke English and Spanish to them and about 20-30 of French ( YouTube lessons)99% of the French people we met were super friendly. Paris is so culturally and historically rich. The food was superb. Croissants, baguettes, great wine ! Need I say more ...We will definitely be back! Thank you to Tripmasters, TripAdvisors, Air France, Hotel Corona Opera, and the City and people of Paris for a Wonderful and unforgettable Anniversary trip !\n",

Room was ok, fairly small, a little worn down, bed was good, bathroom was small, but shower was good and everything was clean, Breakfast was overpriced and looked dull so I did not try it. Staff was friendly. Even though I left the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, the cleaners still came in and turned out my room- NOT ok. I had everything valuable in the small safe except my laptop which I had thankfully hidden within the furniture. Who knows why they thought that it was ok to enter, but nothing appeared to have been taken. Wifi was very slow. Walls were thin- the guy talking loudly on his phone next door woke me in the morning.\n",

It is a very short walk from one of the main boulevards and the metro, though I walk - a lot - and enjoy exploring. I found it easy to walk to the principal tourist destinations, though others would probably opt for the metro. It was good that there were convenience stores and lots of restaurants very close by.The room I had was clean and fresh and the bathroom well-stocked. Carpet had a few burn marks even though the rooms are non-smoking. I think that's more down to inconsiderate guests as you can't expect a hotel to be constantly replacing carpets.Good variety on offer for breakfast, though the cooked offer somewhat limited.No problems recommending as a very good place to base yourself for a long weekend/tourist visit\n",

Numerous great restaurants less than 5 minute walk away. The hotel is clean and always staffed with English speaking staff. Breakfast was good. The lift (elevator) is only large enough for 1-2 suitcases with one person, so if you cannot climb stairs, this will not work for you.

The location of the hotel was fantastic. It made Paris doable even without benefit of the Metro or busses. I highly recommend using the airport shuttle that the hotel recommends. On time, hassle free, and competent. It was well worth the 18E per person. As others have stated the rooms are Paris small, but clean and well equipped. Daily maid service happened with no fuss and rooms were nicely made up. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom clean and plenty of hot water. It you are looking for a quiet isolated location, this isn’t it, there is some hubbub on the small streets surrounding the location -which frankly provided the Parisian atmosphere. A small convenience store is a block away with a larger M&S and Monoprix 3-4 blocks away. Lots of restaurants and a fantastic chocolate shop on your doorstop. \n",

      "  review_body : I don’t know what’s worse, the girl and guy at the front desk who have zero problem solving skills, or the horrible state/smell of the hotel that does not represent the photos online at all. The lobby shows that a classic room is €900 but yet they charge €100 per night if you refer to an online booking agencies listed price. False advertising? No business ethics? I think the icing on the cake (besides the broken TV, stench of sewage in the elevator and all floors, abysmal 80’s looking plastic shower stalls, and scuffed up floors) is the staff ganged up together to refused to help me, a very pregnant woman on my last two days in Paris who just got stuck in 2 hours of traffic due a protest. Now I bet the wretched women who have been commenting on other reviews will probably say the had nothing to do with the protest, but it’s not about that. It’s about showing one ounce of sympathy for your clients who have chosen to stay with you over the 100’s of other hotels. Have a little bit of respect for those who pick you. The blonde woman at the front refused to give me the owners contact details and told us that he has no time for our problems because he owns 9 other hotels in Paris. Way to throw your boss under the bus. Disgusting hotel and disgusting attitudes to follow. After this experience my husband and I walked around the neighborhood and found several accommodation options with extremely friendly and helpful staff who let you see the rooms before committing. I hope your owner sees this and spends some time training the crying staff on customer service skills, how to listen and problem solve and how to show empathy to people in need, such as extremely pregnant women.\n",

The hotel staff was extremely friendly the entire time. They were extremely patient with me as I very slowly practiced my French with them. The breakfast in the morning was quite extensive and better than what I would get at a cafe (bread, eggs, cheese, fruit yogurt, bacon, ham, crepes). The one thing that may bother some travelers is the bathroom is a \"European\" bathroom in that there are no shower doors so you get basically the whole floor wet. We were okay with this and planned our days to either at the beginning or end with showers. I've read some reviews about street noise, so I brought ear plugs but I didn't need them. I will also say that I live in a major US city with noise, so I may be used to it. I would absolutely stay here again!\n",

The hotel was just around the corner from Place Saint-Michel where we picked up a free walking tour with Sandeman’s New Europe Tours. (Hugo was a great guide!). We ended up in the Louvre area, a great place to sightsee for the afternoon. From the Louvre, it was a 20 minute walk back to the Latin Quarter which was brimming with cafes, restaurants, clubs and more. On Sunday evening, we wanted to see a real Parisien cabaret, and the staff at the Hotel Saint Severin did not disappoint! They arranged dinner reservations at Paradis Latin, a local’s favorite, and I think we ended up with the best seats in the house. The dinner and show was fantastic! We really enjoyed our short stay at the Hotel Saint Severin and our enchanting time in Paris. \n",

I had reserved 2 rooms with balconies and my parent's room was upgraded to a larger unit. It was still very small. The hotel staff was fantastic and we stored our luggage when we arrived in the morning until we could check-in at 2pm. As we were leaving, the gentleman working the front desk let us know that the metro workers were on strike that day, so he called us a cab for our trip back to CDG. The only complaint about the hotel is the noise. Both being able to hear the neighboring rooms and the outside. Between the people up all night in the restaurants outside and the the early morning trash collection, this was not a hotel conducive to sleeping. \n",

The hotel is located right next to bars, restaurants and shops etc which is why we chose this hotel after reading other views. We were not disappointed.

The location is perfect—just around the corner from the St Michel metro stop for line 4 to/from Paris Nord and the RER train directly to/from GDG airport. The area is alive with bars & restaurants in the tangle of cobblestone streets surrounding the hotel, and a convenient base for exploring. Notre Dam & Isle St Louis are a 5 min walk; the Marais district 10min...Rooms overlooking the street can be noisy at night, but that’s to be expected & nothing earplugs won’t solve. Front desk staff were all friendly and professional. Our room 401 was spotlessly clean, spacious by Paris standards with a big super-comfy bed, nice linens & towels & toiletries, a fridge, huge shower with great pressure and TV with several English channels. Air conditioning was quiet & worked perfectly. We got the best rate for our 3-night stay by booking directly via the hotel website, rather than through a 3rd party site (such as Booking.com). I believe the hotel appreciates guests who do this; this was our second upgrade and I’ve booked direct both times....And we will return. \n",

      "  review_body : We just got back from 3 nights at the Jobo... it is such a cool space. A smallHotel (only 24 rooms) in an amazing location the Jobo and it’s staff exceeded expectations.First off Claire and another gentleman (i think his name was George) we’re so welcoming, attentive and friendly. They have suggestions, helped us on our way and genuinely made us feel welcome - big thanks!The hotel itself is just plain cool. The rooms are really small but that doesn’t bother me. Each one is different and they are all super cool mixing patterns and styles. The location is amazing - walking distance to places to eat, drink and shop as well as sites and the metro too.No doubt if I am lucky enough to get back to Paris I will stay at the Jobo again.\n",

      "  review_body : The Hotel de Jobo and their staff are simply excellent. Personable, knowledgeable and kind, the staff provided for all our needs. There was no question or request that couldn't be answered. The beds were supremely comfortable, rooms quiet and elegantly decorated. We had a Jr. suite and our daughter took a single room (small). We were very happy with the space. I loved the amenities of bottled water (complimentary every day), tea & coffee. We enjoyed eating breakfast (excellent, broad selection) and enjoying a drink in the lovely bar. Perhaps the best part was the location - central to Paris, but not a touristy area. 15 minute walk to the Louvre or quicker on the metro - stop just steps away from the hotel. Excellent restaurants and shopping all around the hotel and within short walking distance. We will definitely be back.\n",

This is a lovely small hotel to enjoy a Parisian experience in great location, metro is 3 minutes; we had five excellent dinner meals all recommended by the staff all within 3oometres. Their lounge is a cosy place to sit after the day and where breakfast is served buffet style in morning. Don’t be expecting large international hotel room size it’s very typical Paris city size but ample for a couple. We were on first floor looked out window on street and fire station directly opposite which was no issue at all but again just added to experience of being immersed in the local experience . We caught train to bigger attractions in Paris and walked to others ie Notre Dame. Would be happy to recommend to friends.\n",

Really funky decor (we had the leopard room!), unbeatable location in the heart of the Marais, and updated with all modern amenities. That said, the room is VERY small (even by European standards) and the breakfast spread left something to be desired - which is fine, but given the price, we were a little disappointed. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay, due also to the very kind and helpful staff. Thanks, JoBo!\n",

Each room has its own Parisian charm and while sometimes you don’t want to leave it, you know you’re in the middle of one of the loveliest neighborhoods in Paris with cute restaurants, bars and shops on every street.

      "  review_body : JoBo is perfect. My fiancé and I arrived early in the morning after a red eye flight from New York and appreciated being able to store our bags until our room was ready (and the espressos given to us upon arrival). Cyril at reception was absolutely wonderful -- he gave us a detailed map of The Marais and personally walked us through the neighborhood, noting select restaurants, bars, etc. The dinner spot he suggested (Chez Janou) ended up being our favorite meal of the entire trip. We stayed in a Double Classic -- great for a couple. The layout was extremely efficient, the shower was amazing, and the bed was super comfortable. We faced the street and kept the windows open for a nice breeze (and to watch the cute firemen across the street). Most mornings we had the breakfast buffet at the hotel, which was delicious, and a great value. The Marais is such a dynamic, cool neighborhood, and JoBo is in the center of it. As a gay couple, we felt very comfortable and welcomed both in the hotel and surrounding area, and often had a glass of wine on the patio before heading out for the evening. JoBo felt like home, and we miss it already. We will be back! <3\n",

The pics looked pretty as well so I was completely confident that I would love it. It could not have been better!! We arrived slightly early but our room was ready. Such a comfort when you just want to put down all your stuff and enjoy Paris. The room was a petite triumph! Small but very well appointed. Super cute styling and equipped with everything we needed. Maybe 2 minutes after being shown to our room, a knock on the door and voila, birthday champagne delivered compliments of the hotel and staff in honor of my birthday. We took it down to the courtyard and drank it while resting from the long travel. Really put me in the right mindset. We stayed four nights and it was perfect. Each staff member was very kind, helpful, and beyond pleasant. Breakfast is great, the bar is great, the location is great. Thank you Hotel de JoBo for helping to make my birthday so memorable!!\n",

      "  review_body : They had me at the name and the photos of the rooms' wall coverings! Toile. Leopard print. Roses. Tricolor cockades. We discovered Hotel de Jobo (named for Josephine Bonaparte) while searching for sanctuary during a hellacious experience with an Airbnb rental that turned out to be incredibly gross. Hotel de Jobo was able to accommodate us at the last minute; and after 1 night, they were able to switch us to a different room with a deep soaking tub. The room was small, but was on the top floor so we could look over the rooftops of the Marais and enjoy la vie boheme! (the ground floor room we had has one exposed stone wall with a column that saucily suggests the hotel origins -- as a convent!) Fabulous location in the Marais, close to the Metro, shops, restaurants, Place des Vosges, museums, friendly service, and winsome, cheeky decor that made the historian in me smile. So much thought has gone into the design of the JoBo, it's a romantic delight for every sense, from the comfortable mattresses, to the Cafes Richard coffee in each room (for once, good strong coffee from a pod!) to the soaking tubs (although what is it about the French not giving washcloths--women wear makeup!).\n",

      "  review_body : We had 12 wonderful days at Hotel Jobo. The location in the best in Paris. In The Marais near wonderful restaurants, boutique shopping, architecture, museums, and the old Jewish section. Our favorite dining was at Chez Janou, Clore, Caruso's, and Le Petite Italian---all within a short walk from the hotel. The pastry, bread, quiche and tarts at the Boulangerie on Blvd Beaumarchais is a short walk passed the nearby Place des Voges and Amorino gelato and is a must visit. The Thursday and Sunday Bastille Farmers Market is also a must visit as it is one of the best anywhere with food to eat at the market from produce, to Italuan, Mediterranean, to seafood from Brittany. The flower merchants were reasonable and we enjoyed having flowers in our room. Hotel Jobo is a two minute walk to The Metro that got us around Paris much quicker than in traffic. The Metro comes every 3 minutes. For slower trips the bus stop is around the corner. A dry cleaners/laundry with same day in/out service is around the corner so we will bring much less clothes our next visit. There is boutique shopping throughout The Marais. Our visit was wonderful because the hotel staff at Jobo were terrific. All spoke English. Every time we left or returned to the hotel they asked if we needed anything. They were very knowledgeable and great with their recommendations about Paris. They secured skip-the-line tickets for us to The Lourve and Museum D'Orsay. The hotel bar/lounge is cozy, elegant and romantic. Staff was knowledgeable about other nearby night spots. They also arranged the driver pick-up and return to the airport for us. Housekeeping was excellent and provided large luxurious bath towels. Our bed was very comfortable. The air conditioning was great and quiet. We were told all 24 rooms were booked but we never heard noise from the other rooms on our 4th floor. The hotel staff was the best we've experienced anywhere.\n",

Our room was quiet and comfortable, the staff was very friendly and breakfast was tasty (free with the code TripAdvisor!) We especially liked the location of the hotel, which was about a block away from a metro stop and therefore extremely convenient to anywhere we wanted to go. We walked to restaurants and bars, of which there were many close by, and took the metro to get across town for sightseeing. Would highly recommend this hotel.\n",

The location is central to everything- there is a Metro stop about a block away and The Seine is a short walk- maybe five minutes. While the rooms are small, everything has been thought of and designed to be convenient- from the coffee machines, reading lights, lovely decor and bathrooms. The staff is exceptional: warm, eager to help and knowledgable. The stay at the JoBo made our trip even more enjoyable as it felt as if we were staying with friends. There is an awesome breakfast buffet that is reasonably priced and a picturesque courtyard in the front where you can have wine and snacks. We'll be back for sure.\n",

They were always willing to listen and offer expert advice, We all enjoyed meeting them.I was with a party of 5 that booked three rooms and we were all very happy with our accomodations. The bed was truly comfortable as were the furnishings. We appreciated the coffee and tea makers in each room and also the daily delivery of sparkling and still water. The gift of fine chocolate upon arrival was a lovely gesture and a nice snack for us all to enjoy during the week. Thank you!We thouroughly enjoyed coffee/tea and drinks in the sitting room, which was comfortable and very fun. The servers were friendly and helpful. I had a campari which was delicious.The location in the Marais is wonderful of course as we are so close to St Paul Metro, major museums and other special attractions. It was so nice to walk out of the hotel and into the Marais for a beautiful stroll to the Avenue of the Roses. We also were fortunate to see the Paris Marathon runners just around the corner from the hotel.Overall, we could not have been more pleased with the Hotel de JoBo. It is very clear that all staff take great pride in their work and have a high degree of care and concern for their guests. This is much appreciated.We will be happy to highly recommend the hotel to others as the services and staff support is exceptional. And, we look forward to returning as well.Once again, thank you for everything!Truly yours,\n",

We were not disappointed at all!Location: Superbly located in Le Marais, just down the road from St Paul Metro stop (2min) and great bars, shops and restaurants. Hotel is in its own quiet little courtyard, so it feels very private.Decor: Careful lighting, fabrics and colours make the style of this hotel a beauty. Everything has been designed to well and individually.Room: We stayed in their Junior Suite, on the top floor. It was nice and spacious (rare for Paris, and I hate small rooms) and wonderfully decorated and appointed with everything you need. The bathroom was beautiful as well, with grey/white stone tiling and a wonderful large high pressure shower and bath. The bed was big (super king) and very comfortable and they provided pillows to suit our tastes. The photos on their website are an accurate representation of the room.Service: Discrete, warm and friendly. All the staff were perfect and made you feel welcome, as well as offer recommendations and sort requests as needed. The staff are just perfect.\n",

      "  review_body : As this was our (mother and daughter) first visit to Paris, it took us ages to choose a hotel for our 3 night break. We are so glad we agreed on the Maison Albar Hotel - Le Champs Elysees. On arrival we were greeted warmly by Antoine on reception and Christophe, the concierge. The room we finally ended up (505) was fabulous with a balcony and lovely view. Decadent decor, Bed large and extremely comfortable, great shower, coffee machine, complimentary coffee and tea. Customer service was on point!The hotel is well located for the usual tourist attractions, bars, restaurants, shopping, Lido De Paris and much more. From the hotel were were able to walk to the Eiffel Tower, Lourve Museum, Cathedrale Notre-Dam. Le Champs-Elysees (literally around the corner from the hotel) is a great place to stroll down, lots of people around, safe with a variety of things to see and do.As the hotel is in a busy area, if you are a light sleeper, I would recommend that you ask for an interior room - the one I saw was at the side of the stairs, did not have a great view, quite small (but still lovely) - however much quieter. Alternatively, bring ear plugs!If you are visiting Paris for the first time, I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely book it again.Thanks again to Antoine, Christophe and the rest of the staff for making us feel so welcome to the hotel and to Paris. Cannot wait to return! :-)\n",

Got our room was a twin room rather than a double and when told staff they said this is all we have take it or leave it.

Very disappointed. A poor elevator to go to the room, have to climb stairs to access the room with our luggage who were by the way not even taking care of by them, such an amazing work out. No welcoming water, because it's of course to expensive for them, but they surely offer you a bottle of water in the minibar which cost 5 euros. Way more bad stuff to say but I think it is not even worth it to write it. I am definitely not recommending this hotel,\n",

The room was good, bit loud decor - free bathrobes was nice touch - but quite small and felt small due to being darkly painted. Buffet breakfast was very good, especially delicious fresh OJ, pastries, iberico ham, lavender cake. Staff were helpful, although we had some trouble booking a taxi and then not arriving (but probably due to road closures with demonstrations occurring). Concierge then walked us to local area with taxis which was appreciated. Perfect location for exploring city. Our stay in Paris was marred by the demonstrations but obviously not hotel's fault.\n",

I requested for an early check in. While I agree that is subject to availability, I was asked to come back at 1 and my room would be ready. I ended up getting the room only at 2.30 pm. On entering the room, while it is done up tastefully, it was quite stuffy. I turned on the aircon and surprisingly it wasn’t working. I informed the receptionist Kevin immediately and he mentioned they would have it resolved ASAP. I return to the room a good 5 hours later and it isn’t fixed. I speak to the same gentleman at the reception who now says there are no available Technicians as it’s a Saturday and that it could only be resolved on Monday. On complaining he said he will personally come and check on it. Nothing was done. The receptionist then changes and the new person says there is nothing they can do about it. Without any options I leave the window open and had a pathetic sleepless night as I had a good number of mosquitoes keep me company in the room. The following morning I heard the manager discussing a similar issue with some other guests. Obviously this is a common occurrence at this hotel but they don’t seem to feel the need to address it. I would expect this level of service and quality from a cheap hotel. At a 5 star with that price tag, I find it difficult to understand. I would think a hotel with that rating would have quality control checks in place. Moreover, their staff would be expected to have received at least a minimal level of training in how to handle customer grievances. I was sorely disappointed with my experience at this hotel and would not recommend it. If you are willing to pay that much, there’s a multitude of hotels belonging to reputed chains in the area which would certainly do a better job at providing a comfortable stay. \n",

Problem is that only one small window opened and not the other 2 which would have provided ventilation. They should either allow the system to work in circulating air mode without heat or allow all 3 windows to open. Plus front desk should know this. They also told another guest they would try and fix it twice. Pity because it was a great location and setup but ventilation was poor for a 4* which makes it more like a 3*\n",

      "  review_body : I visit try to visit Paris annually for my birthday. This trip was exceptional. It was first time staying at the Hotel Saint Germain. I will plan to come back. The hotel is just lovely. The service is world class. The breakfast each morning, served on quaint blue and white china, was icing on the cake. I just happen to love blue and white china :) The staff were charming, attentive and so professional. I was even gifted a jar of honey from their own hives. It is exquisite - like an explosion of delicate flowers.I think about Paris each morning as I have my biscuit and honey. They helped to make my birthday very special - and unforgettable. The room I shared with my granddaughter was very pretty - the bathroom beautiful and had a full shower/tub combo. The beds very comfortable with beautiful linens.. The location of the hotel can't be beat - just four block walk to the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay in one direction and about the same to Bon Marche in the other. But, no matter where we set out to visit each day, we were not far away. Many thanks for their service, attention to detail and warmth. I can't recommend this hotel enough.\n",

The welcome was very warm, and my room was well equipped, overlooking the rue du Bac. The staff was most helpful, my room well attended, and the room equipped with thick bath towels, nice sheets, and a comfortable bed. The breakfast was average, but the hot coffee and fresh juice was a nice way to start the day. The location is spect, near3 metro lines, and within easy walk of most attractions on both banks. Lots of food choices, both eat in and take out, as well as Le Grand Epicerie just a 5 minute walk. I especially enjoyed the gentleman, Juan, who attended the desk at the weekend. Overall, I can recommend this hotel as a perfect place to stay.\n",

Michael and the hotel assistant manager (we didn’t get her name, but she was great!) worked hard to make sure we were happy guests :) The rest of our stay was perfect, the rooms were a good size for Europe and many of the hotel staff speak perfect English. The hotel has a super cute little lounge area that you can drink your own wine in, or order from the hotel. They were happy to provide us with wine glasses and an ice bucket.The breakfast is yummy: pastries, cheese, great yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea, hard boiled eggs. Perfect for a quick start to the day.The hotel has adorable decor, perfect for instagram pics. The beds are comfy and the house keeping was impeccable. Very very clean hotel.25 min walk to Notre dame and saint chapelle. Many great restaurants, chocolate shops, perfume shops etc in the area.  We will stay here again if we return to Paris. \n",

It's a busy, high end area with easy access to major sites via metro, only a minute away, or bus, equally close. The hotel is a short walk to the Rodin Museum and an easy ride to other major sites, including among others, the Musee D'Orsay, Eiffel Tower, and Sacre-Coeur. There are many reasonably priced brasseries and other restaurants on rue de Bac, and lots of shopping, though much of it pricey. Our room was adequate but tiny, fairly common in Paris. The bathroom was spacious. A cold breakfast, with standard fare, was included in our package. Concierge service was excellent, efficient, and friendly.\n",

He gave me such detailed advice on what to see, how to get there, and made me feel so at home during my stay. I happened to stay in 2 different rooms during my 3 night stay because I booked one night in a larger room through my credit card points. My first 2 nights were in the deluxe room (the first price point level) Its not ideal for 2 people if you have large luggage because it’s definitely a cozy European style room. We made it work, but best to get the superior room for 2 people if you want to be more comfortable with space. The rooms were super clean, the bath products were great, the breakfast was simple and delicious!

      "  review_body : Our family of 4 just finished a 9 day stay at Hotel Saint Germain on Rue de Bac (there are several hotels in Paris with similar names), and truly had a lovely stay. The hotel is located perfectly within a 5-30 minute casual walk from any of the major attractions or destinations, in a nice, safe neighborhood where several embassies are located. There are numerous great cafe's and brasseries right around the property as well. As Americans who speak very little French, we had no difficulty whatsoever communicating with the staff, as every front desk person, as well as the manager, spoke perfect English, even on email communications prior to our stay. The breakfast provided each morning is also wonderful. Several of the staff members such as Michael, Juan, Pedro, Edoard & Laurent helped us make dinner reservations, plan activities including the best means of transportation to them, and recommended can't-miss places to go. Edoard even helped me locate a 24 hour pharmacy early on a Sunday morning to get medication for one of our family members, and Pedro personally went to a bakery to get me a pastry for the staff to surprise me the next morning at breakfast for my birthday! Overall, it was a wonderful stay in a clean, European boutique hotel with a perfect location, wonderful staff, and reasonable pricepoint. We will definitely plan to stay at Hotel Saint Germain again, and recommend it to our friends.\n",

Parisian decor, window boxes, quaint rooms, pretty breakfast room with a perfect European breakfast spread, helpful staff pointing us in the right direction. The room and bathroom were small but we were expecting that in Paris. Next time I'd probably choose a room with shower only, as the bath was tiny and the shower over bath not that great, and it may have allowed slightly more room in the bathroom, but it was fine. We wanted a street view which we loved, and the double-glazed windows cut out any noise.The staff were fantastic. Pedro, Michael and everyone else couldn't be more helpful and accommodating. The location is so convenient - a metro station just a stone's throw away, but the Seine, the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay and so many other attractions just a short walk from the hotel. And so many gorgeous pavement cafes to stop at for a St Germaine Spritz or whatever catches your fancy! During our search, there were certainly more modern and more groovy hotels in this price range, but the character of this hotel ticked the boxes for us. Highly recommend!\n",

But we were rarely there, and it was no smaller than other European hotel rooms I have stayed in. The bathroom was rather expansive for the size of the bedroom, and was modern. Our room was in a small courtyard, which added to the charm. The staff were wonderful and helpful. And the breakfast is perfect for what we needed - some coffee and pastries to get us on our way. But again, the location was the absolute highlight. Five minute walk to Musee Rodin in one direction, five minute walk to the shops and restaurants on Blvd St. Germain in the other direction. Great views of the Eiffel Tower five minutes in another direction. And really, you could stay right within two blocks of the hotel to eat and shop with abandon. The street is absolutely adorable.\n",

It was just down the block. The next evening after a full day of museums and site our tired feet wanted to stay closed to the hotel. Lucky for us the Café Varenne was at the other end of the block - so good! If I ever get back to Paris again I would definitely plan a stay at Hotel Saint Germain.\n",

      "  review_body : Our family of four stayed here at the end of December. Our kids are ages 16 & 12. It was the perfect place to get the feel of a small, boutique Parisian hotel. Its a particularly great place to stay with kids because you can get a sort of shared “suite.” The kids had their own room and bathroom, we had a little shared hall, and then we had our own room and bathroom...the shared hall between us then had one main door into the hallway. Very nice for family travel! It’s located on the Left Bank, great shops, restaurants, market, all nearby. The staff is so friendly, made us feel very welcome and I think our favorite part was the complimentary breakfast served each morning. It was delicious! Great pastries, cheese, hard boiled eggs, dried fruit...really nice! The only problem we had there happened on really the last two nights ( we stayed there for three nights). As I stated before the kids had their own room and we parents had our own room. The electricity went out in our bedroom and bathroom. They offered to have us change rooms, but we had booked this place to be near our children,and if we had moved rooms, we would have been on separate floors. They tried and tried to fix the problem, and The electricity would come on for a time, then go out again. It was a bit frustrating, because although we weren’t in our room all that much, it would have been nice to have light in the bathroom especially to get ready for dinner, and well to see at night when using the restroom! Luckily, we did have the kids bathroom right next door, or otherwise I think it would have been more of a problem. We know it’s an old building, and we really tried to be patient because we loved everything else about this hotel!!! They did work with us and gave us a small credit back. Ideally though I think the credit should have been a bit more because we basically lost the function of a room for two nights! Still giving this place a five star...and I would recommend! Just hope the electricity is fixed on floor 3 at the suite at the top of the stairs!\n",

Michael, Philippe & Fernanda at the front desk were so gracious and attentive as were the breakfast and housekeeping staff, we felt as if we were returning home each time we walked through the door.The hotel is charming, what you dream Paris to be...jazz playing softly in the lobby and dining rooms, set in a 17th century building with exposed beams and stonework, Toile curtains and bedding, antiques, winding staircases, a tiny elevator, windows that open to courtyards and the absolute best street in the arrondissement! Musee Maillol and Beau Passage are around the corner, Musee D'Orsay is at one end of the street, Le Bon Marche and Hermes at the other; cafes, world class boutiques, chocolatiers, boulangeries, the renowned Arpege restaurant, the Rodin Museum, all outside the door! At night the hotel is quiet; the beds are very comfortable and breakfast (classic continental with the addition of hard boiled eggs, yogurt and fruit) was perfect before heading out for the day. We will stay here next time we are in Paris! The character of the building, the charm of the fabulous 7th arrondissement and the courtesy of the staff truly made our stay at the Hotel St. Germain our best holiday so far!\n",

      "  review_body : A friend and I stayed 6 nights at Hotel Saint Germain early this December and had absolutely the best experience. As many other reviewers have noted, the location is wonderful! We were able to walk to the Louvre, Siene, Luxembourg Garden etc all in less than 20 mins. For sites further away, the metro is but a brief walk from the hotel as well. We found getting around to be VERY easy. We stayed in a double room with twin beds and found the space to be more than enough (for two girls with a lot of clothes mind you!). I've read that most rooms in Paris are small, so I would say this was better than expected. And quiet! There was absolutely NO noise issues during our stay, neither from the street nor the neighboring rooms. The service was truly exceptional. Michael at the front desk helped us carry in our luggage in on the first day and out again when we left. He was so kind and inviting, we felt very comfortable asking any questions during our stay. In fact, all the employees who were at the front desk were helpful, I just cannot remember their names! We were here during one of the yellow vest protests in the city center, and the hotel gave us all the information we needed and wanted to navigate through the day. The women who served us at breakfast were SO warm, kind, and attentive, we have nothing but wonderful things to say about the reception we received while we were here. The breakfast was always good, with an assortment of pastries and yogurts, fruit and eggs, we found it to be a wonderful start to our day! Overall, I have only the best review to give to Hotel Saint Germain and would not hesitate to stay here again when back in Paris!\n",

I will say that the hotel paid our cab fare to the other hotel and back again, but that's all they did. I would also like to mention that Fernanda on the front desk was awesome.Rooms are small but I've travelled in Europe enough to know that is not unusual.

The room was tiny - no bigger than small bedroom - the washroom was broken into 2 parts - the toilet in one tiny space and the shower in another. Both were so tiny it was almost impossible to turn around, We had to leave the shower doors open in order to be able to properly shower. The bed was a very small double - more like an oversized twin bed. When we left for the day at 9:00 a.m and returned at 3:30 pm. - the room had not been touched. We had to ask for fresh towels. They offered to clean the room but we would have to leave for another 15 minutes. We declined. The only good thing about this hotel is the location.The staff were friendly and they gave us some croissants when we left. Do not book this hotel. It's not worth the price they charge.\n",

The hotel has a beautiful comfortable lobby, an excellent continental breakfast and a very helpful staff. The hotel's left bank location can't be beat. It is a block and half from a Metro Stop on Boulevard St. Germain and a short walk from the Seine. But the Rue de Bac is a side street with limited traffic and noise. The neighborhood is not exceptionally touristy, which means that you can easily get what you need in the way of food and supplies without paying inflated prices. This includes several good eateries within a two block area. We thoroughly enjoyed our five night stay and plan to return.\n",

This charming boutique hotel and its perfect location on a quiet street in the lovely St Germain des Pres area made for a wonderful trip to Paris. We love walking, and from its location on Rue de Bac we were able to hit all of the main attractions in Paris without the need to use the metro (although one is close by if desired). The staff is very friendly; both Michael and Romain went out of their way to provide excellent service and advice. Michael even went to the bar across the street to get ice for us one afternoon after we came back from a long day of touring and wanted some to chill the Cokes we had in our room (the hotel ice maker was out at the time). We stayed in one of the garden rooms on the first floor which was small (as expected in European hotels) but comfortably furnished in toile and had great air-conditioning. The bathroom was large and modern which was a big plus. The breakfast of wonderful pastries, yogurts, cheeses and hard-boiled eggs was a great start to our day. All in all I would highly recommend Hotel Saint Germain!\n",

      "  review_body : I liked this hotel, but didn't love it. The property is well located near the Opera & shopping scene. This was not a sightseeing trip for us, but the hotel is also well-located for hitting the major tourist sites. With the exception of the cheerful young woman who worked the front desk, the staff was rather blah. Not unpleasant, but not friendly and gracious. Our room was good...basic modern style, good lighting, clean, and a comfortable bed, but with limited storage space for two people. Breakfast was very good but the breakfast service staff acted as though you were inconveniencing them. Management really needs to work on that! The pool & steam room are a nice feature, but note that you must book in advance. Your hour booked at the pool and steam room are private. This is necessary because the pool is really just a plunge pool. The steam room was not hot when we arrived and the staff mentioned they had been having some trouble with it. Note there is an extra charge for reserving the pool & spa area if it is not specifically included in the rate. There is an honor bar in the lobby if you want a drink in the evening, but no cocktail hour scene at all. This is not a luxury hotel, but it does try to convey a hip fashion theme. I would stay here again if I got a great rate.\n",

Dress Code can definitely be recommended, imaginatively helpful, innovative and pleasant staff. The hygiene is top notch in the room and in common areas.

Hotel is in perfect location just a few blocks from Opera and just off a side road. Room is definitely boutique, amenities are very well appointed. The spa you can reserve for an hour block at a time the whole spa and sauna to yourself. Do this right when you arrive (or before if you can) for an hour block once a day.

This hotel is one of my new favorites, and the best one we stayed at for this entire trip.The hotel is located within walking distance of many attractions (Louvre, Place Vendôme, Opera, etc.) and train stations. The staff is professional, engaging and helpful.The room is quiet, spacious, and wonderfully designed. It even has double-set windows that open to a cute, small balcony that overlooks the street. The bathroom is beautiful and elegant with wonderful, sulfate-free bath products and fluffy white towels. The shower is amazing. The bed is firm with perfectly plush pillows. We slept really well! There are free coffee and tea in the room. Excellent wifi too.The lobby is immaculate, contemporary and tastefully decorated. There is an honor bar. The fruits and cake slices are free. Love it!We even took advantage of the pool and spa. Make reservations at the front desk. When it's time for your appointment, you have the entire room to yourself for an hour -- what a relaxing retreat!We also happened to be here when the gilets jaune (Yellow Vests) protests were taking place. I have to give credit to the hotel staff -- they were wonderful and handled it exceptionally -- they remained professional, calm, kept us informed (the day before and day of) and made sure everyone felt safe. Of course, being New Yorkers, we're not going to let a little protest get in the way, we had a lovely day out. We enjoyed our entire time here in Paris, Hotel Dress Code is like a home away from home -- so pampering! Très Chic! We had a wonderful stay here, would highly recommend.\n",

      "  review_body : We stayed here as part of a package from Voyage Privé and found it very clean, well run and good value for money. The location is excellent, a five minute walk from Madeleine metro station. The rooms were big, clean and have modern decor and plenty of storage space, the reception/breakfast area is equally well decorated and the breakfast buffet offers a delicious, wide range of continental breakfast, with extras like boiled and scrambled eggs.We had a free visit to the spa included in our stay, it's very small (as is the nature of a city centre hotel) and is essentially a whirpool/jacuzzi pool and a sauna, it was enjoyable for an hour and a welcome break from walking in the heat, but I can't say I would have paid to use it otherwise. The reception staff are very helpful and gave us recommendations and suggestions throughout our four night stay.My only criticism would be that we couldn't check in at the time advised on our booking as the cleaners hadn't made it round quite yet, so we came back an hour later as advised, to find it still wasn't ready and had to wait about a further 30mins. Not the end of the world but I'd suggest ensuring you give guests a more realistic time frame so they aren't trecking back to the hotel constantly, and potentially try to have a courtesy room for them to shower etc in during the summer months. We arrived in 34 degree heat in the middle of the day and were desperate to have five minutes and freshen up somewhere with air con - unfortunately getting changed and washed over a sink in the hot downstairs bathroom wasn't ideal.However, this is my only criticism and I'd certainly consider staying again when I visit Paris - teething issues like this are to be expected at any new hotel and I was impressed with how smoothly the rest of our stay went.Tips: If you're coming by Eurostar and have heavy cases it's worth using uber - it was only about 12 euros to Gare du Nord from the hotel.Do not let ANYONE help you with tickets at metro or train stations - the fact scamsters are rife on the rail networks in Paris is not publicised as they worry it will put tourists off. A man offered to help us with tickets from Paris to Versailles as the machine only took French credit cards and we gave him cash in return.. he had in fact cancelled the transaction when we were getting the money out of our bags and bought a ticket worth about 40p - he took over 50 euros from us for two 'return tickets' which were useless.\n",

Room was cleaned well every day. Barhroom was not pracrical with no where to hang towels etc. Had breakfast in the room 3 times, every time the eggs, sausages and pancakes were cold. The rest of breakfast was great. Got wrong juice the last day. We had breakfast included, but the hotel tried to charge for all dishes because we ticked off on the wrong side of order sheet. Had continental included. The hotel fixed it and we pyed only extra for delivery to room (5 euro per day). A bit unproffessional. The massage was great. Steam room and pool a bit cold. They were fixing door lock to pool and noisy when we were in the pool and steam room. So door was open part of the time. They could have informed about that and we would have chosen another time for our time in the pool. Barhroom in spa not clean. Can tell that they are still in start up phase. Will probably come back.\n",

      "  review_body : We had a fantastic stay at this new hotel. From the moment we arrived, Faustine and Inais were such a huge help and a massive credit to this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for them, they gave us great recommendations of places to visit and eat and were always smiling and helpful. The hotel is in a great location, a short taxi ride from all the main attractions and a short walk away from shops and restaurants. The decor is great and the theme inside the hotel is brilliant, even down to their pens being in the shape of a lipstick! You have to book in advance to use the spa as it is very small but the advantage of doing this means that you have the use of it to yourselves. All in all a great stay and we will definitely visit this hotel again on our next trip to Paris.\n",

Charlene was gracious, the location was perfect (short walk from metro, the Ritz, Opera, many other places, and a little further walk or taxi for the Louvre), our suite was great, and the environment was boutique luxury, which we love. We definitely recommend this hotel and are happy to return, thank you. p.s. the breakfast wasn't all that great, but it's my favourite meal of the day, so I'm partial. :) \n",

We appreciated the USB chargers built into the bedside tables as well as all of the modern amenities in the hotel. It is located just a short stop from either the Opera or Madeline Metro stops to get you where you need to go in Paris. There are a lot of good restaurants, patisseries and cafes nearby. We will certainly be back to this hotel. Breakfast is available at 18 Euro’s per person.\n",

Thank you Ben and Charlene for all of the great tips. Since the hotel is new, the rooms are very clean and the bed is one of the most comfortable I have had in a hotel. The hotel is in a great location, but it is also quiet so a good nights sleep is assured. The breakfast is quite tasty and filling. I also liked concept of the honor bar as the lobby is comfortable for conversing and enjoying a glass of champagne with friends. Again, I highly recommend this hotel.\n",

The rooms and bathrooms are really cool and modern with quality furnishings and oozing with style. Really quiet and comfy as well. The lobby is bright and airy with a calming foliage wall and skylight, ideal for breakfast before a days touring or a relaxing drink after a days shopping. The pool and steam room add a little something extra! Will certainly stay again!\n",
