0,"Lovely clean hotel but the superior room was at best basic.The balcony was tiny, no furniture could even fit out there, it was like a block of flats.The bedroom was clean and nicely presented but the smell of drains in the bathroom was unpleasant. The bathroom was a great size but would rather it was more modern and the space better used on the balcony.When you think of superior, you don’t expect a bedroom then bathroom and that’s it. Was not worth the money.Location was good, easy to get to anywhere as it was literally a 1min walk to the main Barcelona train station and the metro line.Food wise, breakfast was nice and there was a lot of variety. Drinks prices at the roof bar, for a double and mixer well over priced!!The swimming pool on the roof was tiny, leave your lilo at home. The area around the pool was a good size, kept very clean and tidy and had all day sun shine. The hotel on the whole was clean and tidy, the 3rd floor where the meeting rooms, lounge area and food and drink were served was the best feature apart from that save your money and just book a basic room and least you get what you pay for then.If you want a good night of food pop across the road to out of India AMAZING!","September 23, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

1,"The hotel is in the centre and close to all attractions, and transport links. It was clean and well maintained. It had all the facilities we needed. Staff were very welcoming and willing to please. There was a large restaurant with extra extensions although it was still very busy every morning The breakfast offering was large and varied, well cooked and frequently replenished. Thank you Expo Barcelona for an enjoyable stay.","September 22, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

2,"My partner and I stayed at this hotel and the room was filthy, especially the floor. we complained several times but nothing was ever done. Also my towel was taken from the room and when I reported it to reception, I was told it had been taken by mistake by the cleaner and sent to laundry and I would get it back. Nobody got in touch to update me and I had to ask for an update several times. I was always told they had it and I’d get it I heard this every time including up to the day I was leaving. They took my address and said they’d send it to me. Again they did not contact me. K have written but was told they don’t have it and would not compensate me in any way. I can only presume it was stolen. I felt the hotel handled the situation badly and didn’t care at all. Extremely poor customer service and standards off cleanliness. I would definitely not recommend this hotel.","September 17, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

3,"We stayed at this hotel , as my daughter was working nearby and the hotel was convenient. My first impressions were not great, as it seemed to take forever to check in. It was not the hotel’s problem, as we had booked via booking.com, so as we needed to adjust our booking, that was totally acceptable.Once checked in ; we were showed to our room; it was ‘stark’; two single beds ( on wheels) reminiscent of dormitories, pretty basic , but lots of space. I found once we had adjusted to the room , it was actually ok. The room , though basic, provided very comfortable beds, duvets, and pillows. The Bathroom , although a bit dated, provided a bath and shower with great water pressure, and lovely hot water. I would give this hotel a 3.5 ,l.M","September 11, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

4,"This hotel is very clean and with a fantastic location it is near lots of restaurants and the train station Barcelo Sants which can take you directly into the city centre or the beach very quickly. There is also a taxi rank just outside the station around a 2 minute walk from the hotel, which always had taxis waiting there for customers. They served lovely food and the views from the rooftop restaurant are amazing. During the night there was never once any noise disturbance. Spacious bathroom and excellent air conditioning within the room. However no chairs or any furniture at all on the balcony.Although the pool area is quite small it is very peaceful and relaxing up there on the rooftop. The only problem was you couldn’t take up any drinks which weren’t purchased within the hotel up to the pool area. So we had to go back to our hotel room and leave our water and soft drinks.

6,From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we felt welcomed. Staff are friendly and nothing is to much trouble and helpful when we needed advice. my partner had a birthday whilst there and he received a lovely card through our door lovely. Rooms were clean and tidy and the air con was so nice. Breakfast was everything that anyone needed I was full every morning. Rooftop bar was an added bonus lovely atmosphere. We didn’t use the pool sadly as we got back to late most evenings. Great location near train station that’s 3 stops from airport.

9,Family HolidayJust home trip to Barcelona durning our trip we stayed in Expo Hotel. We had a very pleasent stayfelt like home from home . The hotel had a excellent standard of cleanliness throughout and our room was lovely and spotless and cleaned to a high standard.We stayed on 9th floor and had no trouble at all with noise from roof top bar and pool area. Hotel had a large buffet breakfast to suit all travellers taste hot and cold food served and we ate lunch in hotel restaurant it was lovely and very reasonable priced as was beverages. Staff were extremely helpful and very friendly nothing was to much trouble and very informative about local area and able to tell you what was within walking distance of hotel. We were within walking distance of Sants train station and Metro system so were able to get about easy with a bit of advise from staff. There was some lovely restaurant directly across the road from hotel which we ate in and a supermarket next door. We felt Expo Hotels location was good and were able to travel around on metro system by purchasing a 5 day travel pass. Would highly recommend this hotel to all.,"August 18, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

10,"Overall the hotel was fine - if you dont need any luxury or any extra and just want a place to sleep and relax in Barcelona. The hotel it self is near to Pl. Espanya and actually in a really livedly area. It’s a bit far from centar it self as it takes around 40-45 min to walk there and one hour to Beach Barceloneta (and therefor even longer to one of the other beaches). Therefor you have to take the metro (which is right next to the hotel), bike or taxi really often. It didn’t bother us, we were there for one week and therefor it was okay but for an extended weekend for example I would choose something in the centar. The hotel had a really nice terasse plus an okay pool. A bit small though - but def better than nothing! When I read the reviwes (old ones) my self before I arrived I thought that they’d fix a few things by now but no.The hotel it self was really simple - and that’s what it is. A few pictures, a blanket on the floor and a fake flower in the room could make a huge difference. The hallway was really dark and kind of creepy. The room seemed a bit old and had no tea/coffee area as every hotel I’ve ever been in had. I could read that you have to buy a more expensive room - but honestly. Why not have that in every room. The mini bar was empty. There were no toiletbrush in the bathroom - why!? They have that even at public restrooms. The bed was on wheels, was noisy and not good at all. There was a fine balcony but with no table or chairs. Thin walls which made it loud and you could hear when people walked in the hallway/opstairs plus you could her traffic noise and people outside (we were on 5th floor). It was basically like being in an old apartment building. It is definately not a 4 star hotel. I would say 2 if it wasnt for the terasse and pool (good cocktails!) - that makes it 3 to me. I really feel like the hotel has a lot of potential and I really dont get why the owners doesnt do a bit more to make it up to date and add basic things as a toiletbrush and tea/coffee area. For the money the hotel was fine - but next time I will probably look for another hotel.","August 12, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

11,"Very conveniently situated near 2 stations and the main bus terminal and a huge supermarket right next door! Very modern looking entrance and friendly reception staff who checked us in. Room was very spacious as was the bathroom. Tea and coffee supplied in individual packs and obviously there was a kettle too. Mini bar fridge with complimentary bottles of water. Safe in the cupboard if needed. Bathroom had a hairdryer as well as soap, conditioner, body lotion, hair and body wash, a comb, toothbrush & toothpaste, a shaving kit, and a kit with earbuds and cotton wool. I also noticed in one of the drawers there was a mending kit and a shoe buffer. We had a balcony which was great. There is air-conditioning in the room. Room was made up every day and bathroom necessities replaced. There is a restaurant on the 3 floor which we didn’t use as we went out to eat and there is also a rooftop bar serving burgers and a few other snacks which had an awesome view. A few steps up was the swimming pool with loungers and towels supplied. Price was very reasonable and it was a nice area to wander around. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

12,"We recently stayed at the Expo in Barcelona during the Sonar festival. At first glance the hotel looks very nice with a beautiful and stylish lobby area. Our room still wasn’t ready at 3.30pm so we had to wait an extra 20 minutes while they found us another one. The hotel was busy so it was no big issue. The hotel rooms are very poor with large cracks in the walls some have been covered and some not. The room is very basic with no comfort or kind of luxury for a 4 star hotel in one of the most amazing cities in the world. The bathroom was nice but felt old as many holes in the tiles around the shower and bath. The bed was ok even though it looks like a hospital bed but was ok to sleep in. There was good space for clothes in the closet with more than enough hangers. The roof pool is very nice and the view is incredible and roof terrace bar was very nice too, for me the highlight of the hotel. We where however interrupted every morning at 9 am by construction in the next room with very loud machinery and banging when we called down they said it’s ok they will be finished in 10 minutes, which was not true. Also the house keeping ladies seam to stand in the hallway most of the day taking very loudly while one of them vacuums two of them stand there and have loud conversations with each other most of the day. I can see why they are still cleaning rooms until 4pm as they are too busy taking. ","July 27, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

13,"We stayed in Barcelona for the last 3 days of our trip. We had a great time since we were able to visit touristic areas in the mornings and stay by the pool from 3/4 pm to 8pm (got a very nice tan). The Montjuïc palace is only a 10 minute walk, and the Gaudí casa’s and Rambla street are a 7 € cab ride. There is breakfast at the hotel (16€/person) but if you’re looking for a cheaper option, there is also a restaurant right next door called Solric that serves a hearty English breakfast for 6.5€. For dinner we mostly went to the Terraza (very good prices), which brings me to my next point. One of the waiters named Paolo was great, super attentive, remembered our names, and overall made us feel welcomed. His hospitality and professionalism played a huge role in our overall experience and how much we enjoyed ourselves. Because of him, we would definitely recommend Expo to our friends.  Thank you Paolo!","July 18, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

14,"The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel staff provided a portable crib for my 2 1/2 year old toddler. We enjoyed the rooftop bar and pool and the view. We appreciated the proximity to the full grocery store downstairs as well as plenty of restaurants nearby. We enjoyed the Parc Industrial also nearby where I could let my son run around freely and play. If I have any criticism whatsoever, it is that the service was a little slow on the rooftop--not because the staff wasn't working very hard to satisfy the demand--there was just too great a demand for the staff on hand. The hop-on-hop-off bus stop was also close.","July 15, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

17,"Having looked at photos of the Expo hotel online I expected a similar room to what I stayed in the week before at the Gran Torre Catalyuna but I was to be very disappointed. As soon as I walked in the AC was blasting so the room was freezing cold and it had a dull cold feel to the whole room generally. There was no art work on the walls like the photos online, no tea and coffee facilities, no ironing facilities, no luggage stand. Just a room with a bed and an old desk that had seen better days. The balcony door was also not sealed properly so you could hear all the noise from the street including the rubbish collection at 3am. The room had obviously had some work done on the wiring at some point with a very poor job on patching it up afterwards. Definitely not 4 star.","June 19, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

18,"Good hotel, good location but additional charges upon check out. Be sure to get your receipt and go over all charges before leaving the building. I booked for $565.84 euros but was charged more than this. I think I may have been charged for a breakfast I ended up having to cancel due to the fact that I had ordered for an 8am breakfast and by 9:00 they still hadn’t arrived with my breakfast - hence the cancellation, I would’ve continued waiting but I had a tour I had to attend. Perhaps book through a travel agent so it’s a fixed price and you can minimise any additional charges.","June 19, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

The rooftop pool is a bit smaller than expected but there’s plenty of sun loungers and views from the top are incredible. The metro station is also really close only a 2 minute walk with all the central areas then being a 15 minute journey.

22,"I chose this hotel for the 20th anniversary of the MUFC treble, so me and my friends could go to the Camp Nou and reminicse. We took the RENFE train from the airport, which was pretty easy really and very cheap. The taxis are pretty reasonable too if you don't fancy taking public transport. The hotel is opposite SANS train station, you can see it to your right as you come out of the front entrance, by Mercadona supermarket. It is quite an ugly building, grey concrete, but don't let that put you off. the interior has been refurbished to a modern standard and the rooms are a good size and nicely appointed.I didn't get to see the roof top pool & bar as the weather wasn't great. I only used the bar in the restaurant on the 3rd floor, which was perfectly good.I can't comment on breakfast as we ate out each day, but it looked like a nice area.Check out was smooth but be aware you have to pay a tourist tax (ours was 7 euro per room).Overall a good base for sight seeing and taxis into the city centre were approx 10 euros and this hotel was quite a bit cheaper than the ones in the centre.","May 29, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

23,"I enjoyed my stay at the Expo hotel although a smile would have been nice when I checked in. I would say this was more a 3* hotel rather than a 4* as the room was basic. The bed was comfy, there was a fridge and a hairdryer and a balcony but the shower was atrocious, it didn't stay upright so had to wash holding the shower head and it was either too hot or too cold.I would rate the restaurant highly, the food was delicious and well presented and the staff were so friendly and lovely, they made up for the unpleasant reception. I only went up to the roof terrace once and it wasn't really busy, and I was quite surprised as to how small the pool actually was, compared to how it looked in the photos but a cool place to hang out on a hot sunny day and enjoy some drinks. All in all a pleasant stay, restaurant staff are amazing, reception staff should take some pointers from them, nice enough hotel in a great location with Sants Estacion a stones through away and a taxi rank right outside the hotel to take you wherever you need to go, the hop on hop off bus stops just behind Sants Estació and there is a supermarket right next door so you everything on your doorstep.

28,"We arrived last night at the hotel. Upon entrance the man behind reception was very polite and informative and willing to help in anyway, great start! We were even given a complimentary room upgrade which was very welcome and lovely, particularly considering our reasons for travel. After dumping belongings in the room, we headed for the rooftop terrace... food was expensive, as was drinks.. albeit to be expected for hotels own food. The burger itself was first class although for €11 I expected to get at least some fries with it. A plate of nachos was also another €9 so all in all an expensive meal.After paying I waited at the bar for my change while the man neither said thank you implying I had made a gratuity or asked if I would like to. They simply kept my change and walked off???? Very bizarre. Thus my already expensive meal became a little bit more expensive!The room are nice and clean, also modern with a comfy bed and an extra pillow which I had requested, thank you! Although I struggled to sleep unbelievably due to the air con being more of a heater than a cooler! We were absolutely sweltering... I am yet to complain about this and see what is said.Breakfast was €16 each and was in fairness relatively good. Although I do believe a price of €10 would draw more customers in as I won’t be going back for my remaining two nights due to the price of it. Much cheaper breakfast can be found local to the hotel.Location is slightly out of where you would probably like to be but it is easy enough to get to the tube stations.","May 2, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

29,"Since we are traveling in and out of Barcelona, we booked three separate reservations at Expo. When we made the reservation, the hotel confirmed we could store our luggage between visits (the three reservations were all within a 10 day period). When we arrived to pick up part of our luggage and head to the airport, they declined to store the rest of our luggage. Despite what we explained, the supervisor refused (there was plenty of room in the luggage room). We did a mad scramble in order to store our luggage and make our flight. We booked a room around the corner at the Hotel Torre Catalunya. They were happy to hold our luggage for 5 days until our return. We then hailed a taxi to the airport (vs less expensive plan to take the bus) and just made our flight to Bilbao in time. Because there was no time, we paid 100 euro more for the hotel and more for the taxi. Not cool Expo staff. By the way, the maid did not clean the room during our stay. She only made the bed.

35,The only good thing to say can be the balcony with a chair where there was not another chair in the room. At check in I was told that we could not sleep in the same room ; me my wife and two kids at the ages of 1.5 and 4 . The only thing that I have to say the reservation was made for one person but I never expected that we could not stay in that room even I prepared for the extrapersons bills. I did not know that it was illegal to stay and sleep in that room as a family. Even ready for the extra persons bill but I was told noway. And was reminded that we could be cheched at night whether I was there or not Sooo surprised and dissappointed . Anyway after 30 minutesI moved to another hotel where we had a nice family room. Further even I was alone I would not stay in this room for it was so below than my expectations.,"March 25, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

37,"Located to your right after exiting the train station( Barcelona Sants train station). A 2-3min walk really. It is wheel chair accessible.Upon booking with voyage-prive, our room was upgraded.All hotel staff were good and friendly.The room was clean and stayed that way after housekeeping did their thing each day.Also in the room was a fridge, flat tv and safe box, as well as a wardrobe/cupboard.Bathroom was well equiped and also had a pouch with soaps and gels, a comb and disposable shaving equipment. Very detail oriented i must say.I have seen people complain about having plastic coffee cups. Well, they are the same type of cups you would get at starbucks, tims, mc donalds etc. I dont see the big fuss.We had breakfast included in our deal. For me atleast, breakfast had all and much more. Eggs (scrambled, boiled, sunny side up), sausages, bacon, ham, bread croissants, cheese, tomato, muffins, yoghurt, juice, they even had hashbrown!!!We were on the 7th floor and pretty tired to hear any noise from outside.","March 22, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

39,"Loved the hotel, was given details only a few weeks before travelling.The reception staff are friendly and welcoming. They are very attentive and helpful.A feature I liked was then breakfast was on the third floor, and away from reception, I liked that a lot.....and they do gluten free bread upon request (ask early as it takes 15 minutes obviously frozen) their Buffett section was amazing from cold and hot, fruit cheese. Really good. Did not try dinner there ( see my other reviews)The only downside was that the pool and roof terrace being closed was not information I was given by “my” tour operator (have since found it reopens in May) The rooms are spacious and have balconies, however the wall is low so be careful with small children, rooms have a fridge which is handy, tea coffee facilities and an ironing board and hair dryer.There is a supermarket built underneath it too. Not a massive one but would do for essentials. The only downside was a little noisy on the station side, but that said would definitely say again ","March 10, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

40,"Although we as a family struggled to find it due to the blazing sun blocking our view of the hotel name we fully enjoyed our stay here ! Everywhere was spotless, Moredon and all the staff was friendly especially Andrea on reception who my 5 year old took a liking to ! The food was nice and the rooms were great. Pretty central for walking to places but also right next to train station and metro so only a ever a 10min journey away from anything else ! My only nab is the balcony’s are not child safe at all ! My little boy loved looking out on the balcony but we was feieghyend to death of him going out. And also the balcony door didn’t look which is a problem with a child who now and again sleep walks ! But they are small compared to all the great things this hotel offers.You can get the train from Barcelona airport to Sants estacio station and as you come out turn right and it is right there! Next to the dragon sculpture, just walk round the back to the doors it’s on top of a super market. Literally 2mins left ! We used the metro everyday to get to places and bought a T10 ticket which was 10euros.20 and we could use it 10timea so does take slight journey planning to make them last. Little Italian restaurant round the corner of the hotel is very nice and responsibly priced ! Stadium tour is amazing and we’ve never seen anything like Barcelona zoo ! Absolutely brilliant ! But we did pay £76 euros for the 3 of us to do the city bus tour which was overrated and over priced for what it is. Hope you’ve got something out of this review and it helps someone enjoy their visit to Barcelona :)","March 2, 2019","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

47,"Due to both, its concrete architecture and its location at major roads it is very noisy day and night. Every step your neighbours walk is transported through the walls and I could easily follow the conversations of the people in the next room. Two four lane roads are passing the building and their noise prevented me from opening the balcony door. Even with the doors closed I learned more about the schedule of Barcelona busses than I wanted to. With the balcony door closed due to noise the restaurants smell outside was not such a big problem.The people working here are interesting. Reception staff is not very helpful. They seemed reluctant to care about the customer, even though I was the only one around. Worst is the breakfast Stasi, a lady lurking behind a desk in the breakfast room, waiting for you to pass and then yelling behind you “Sorry Sir, sorry” so that you have to return to tell her your room number. Friendly service looks different to me and since Honekers and Francos time such attitude should have been extinct.But there are sunny sides as well. The cleaners I have met where all friendly and really nice. So, poor sleep, bad staff. What about breakfast then? The best about the breakfast are the Korean hotel guests. They are lovely, curious and friendly. The food was the same for 4 days, for Spain a pretty good breakfast, the coffee is good. WiFi coverage is good.The location is too far to walk into the city centre.So next time I either take a hotel in the heart of the city or outside at the beach.","November 22, 2018","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

48,"At the time of our stay, expo hotel were experiencing some problems with google, they were showing up on google maps on the opposite end of carrier de mallorca This information wasn't forwarded by either the hotel or booking.com in days leading to check in, as a result. It took 4 taxi rides starting @ sants train station, costing €48 ( which is only across the road,) into the middle & been dropped on a corner & told it was opposite side of a building, we ended up walking from here to taxi to be taken back to same spot, repeatedly , this went on for over 2 hours, language barrier didn't help. You couldn't Write it, Its that unbelievable, it was like groundhog day.Thankfully we can laugh about it now To the hotel, it itself is good, beds are comfy,rooms are cleanish, views from bedroom was onto a carpark.Breakfast was amazing, Rooftop bar has a great atmosphere, bar staff were warm friendly & fun, food was nice. The reception staff let the place down. After a very lengthty & costly unnessecary road trip around the 1 way system of barcelona, with ourselves & every taxi driver following google maps,having spoken to girl on reception about this, she got very defensive, they were aware of the situation, their attitude was, it was googles fault, They were trying to get it fixed for weeks,that she'd get the manager to email me, which of course they never did.The hotel is located to the right, just the far side of taxi rank, as you come out front of sants train station. It's location is fantastic, there's a fabulous restaurant across the road, to the right on the end of street called roma. It was amazing. Rooftop pool wasn't open when we there, which was a bit of a let down, us been irish the weather @ 21 degrees is perfect pool weather .I'd definetly stay again, Now that i know where it is.","November 17, 2018","0    Expo Hotel Barcelona

As you leave the train station, look to your right and you will see the name of the hotel up high - it’s that easy! Took 15 mins to get from the airport to it on a train and cost very little as we bought the T-10 ticket (€10) which allowed the 3 of us to use the one card and have 7 trips left over for our stay. The triple room was comfortable and clean. We never ate here as room only rate, but there are so many very good places across the road and around the corner.

59,"The H10 franchise has a series of hotels spread around Barcelona. For our first trip to Barcelona, we studied the various areas that we wanted to see. Our thought process was tempered by the knowledge that we had only one day to cram in as much as we could. Further, we wanted to walk to as many attractions as possible. Factoring in the variables important to us, we rolled the dice with the H10 Art Gallery. We came out winners. The Art Gallery was everything that we wanted, meeting and surpassing all of our desires. They are located on a beautiful tree lined one way street. The seven story hotel is nicely framed with other buildings that came together to provide us a sense of vibe of the city. We arrived early morning after a transatlantic flight. Although we could not check into our rooms until afternoon, the hotel staff was great. They placed all our luggage in a secure room for storage. They provided us complimentary juices and water. They also gave us a great map of Barcelona, circled some suggested sites and got us started on our own self guided tour. The area immediately around the Art Gallery has many pubs and restaurants, within a few dozen feet of the main entrance are several. Further, within a couple block radius are dozens. Of course, the hotel itself has two bars and a restaurant. None in our foursome spoke Spanish, but we had zero communication issues at the hotel or anywhere else around the city. Not that everyone was fluent in English, but many had a very workable understanding. Speaking no Spanish, amazing how clearly I understand someone else speaking even a small amount of English. The people of the city could not have been any more friendly. As stated, we easily walked to various sites including Casa Mile (La Pedrera), Palau Baro de Quadras, Basilica de la Sagrada Familia, Passeig de Gracia (with Casa Batllo, Casa Bonet, Casa Mulleras & Placa de Catalunya), La Rambla (Barcelona's Social Hub) with La Boqueria Market, Palau Guell and the Christopher Columbus Monument. We even made it down to the port and walked along the Rambla de Mar. Of course, along the hike, we periodically stopped in at a side walk cafe for a glass of wine or beer. We had an excellent day walking around the city, facilitated by the great location of the Art Gallery hotel. Once back to the hotel, we checked into our rooms. The rooms were not large but we only needed a place to sleep. The room furnishings were fresh, clean and comfortable. The bathroom too was wonderful. Being there in late June, we appreciated that the A/C worked well. Also are WiFi included. We had a very comfortable, restful nights sleep. The next morning, a free buffet breakfast was included (cereals, coffee, juices, milk, eggs, sausage, ham, yoghurt, breads, rolls and more). The breakfast was extremely excellent - more than enough to get us ready for the day. Upon checking out that morning, the hotel helped us secure a taxi. The taxi stand was just down the block maybe 30 meters. Upon arriving at the taxi stand, we immediately had a cab. We loved our stay at the H10 Art Gallery. Again they met and exceeded all of our needs. We would gladly return, perhaps for multiple nights in order to further explore Barcelona.","July 16, 2019","1    H10 Art Gallery

The rooms were spacious enough and the perks you get if you sign up to become a member is just great! You get a welcoming drink and also a drink at either 2 of their bars. The breakfast was really great, you get a plentiful choice of hot and cold items, coffee, the awesome orange juice and the attention by the staff was incredible.

Taking a taxi is a great and cheap option.Overall would definitely recommend this hotel.","April 28, 2019","1    H10 Art Gallery

68,"Flawless...that is how I would describe this hotel. Spotlessly clean, with super helpful staff. The decor is amazing and the amount of artwork on the walls if just a joy to behold. It is an art lovers paradise. This hotel is classified as 3 star superior - this is way too low a classification. It goes above and beyond in every sense. I am someone who finds fault in every hotel, but in this one...nothing. Possibly the only niggle was the size of the bedrooms, but the space in the building is confined and they do the best they can with it. That said, I didn't go to Barcelona to spend the day in my bedroom, so it served it's purpose. Would I stay here again? Happily!","April 8, 2019","1    H10 Art Gallery

69,"I am a H10 member and travel to Barcelona often. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL. I have stayed at H10 before, but like anything, the staff make the product. This staff sucks. The location is a bit out of the hub bub of the city action but close enough to walk.This is a convention hotel - when I say this, that is who they cater to. I walked in every night at midnight, asking for Ice in a glass to take to my room. There was a corporate party going on blocked by barriers. The front desk told me to walk in and get it.... I was shocked. Typically, they say, I will send it to your room. He pointed to the party, continued chatting with his friend and said -"" Go ask the Bar.""The room was nice - but again, they had a hard time replacing coffee, cream or used cups. I will not stay here again.... I suggest you don't. I LOVE the H10 METROPOLITAN!!!!","March 27, 2019","1    H10 Art Gallery

Insonorisation is perfect as we did not hear a thing once in the room. Only thing is that the room has no balcony.Staff is very friendly and breakfast is good.One of the best point of the hotel is that it is super well located !

71,"I stayed here for 4 nights and absolutely loved it! First of all we noticed that the location is fab with it only being a 5 minute walk away from the diagonal/provença metro station which gives you access to every part of Barcelona if you don’t want to walk, and ensures you don’t have to lug your suitcase for miles when going to and from the airport. When checking in we were greeted by lovely and helpful staff who gave us a welcome drink which you choose from juice, champagne or water, and are given a map of the city as well as a leaflet for the hop on hop off bus tour. The room was a good size, very modern and clean with a very comfy bed and huge shower of good quality! The whole stay we kept getting surprised with the lovely small touches by the staff which go a long way, for example when we returned from a day in the city we were greeted with chocolates and cookies on our bed, we got free crisps when drinking at the bar and we got a free drink each at the bar for becoming h10 member which costs nothing to join! The breakfast was gorgeous with a continental range of breads, yoghurts, meats and cereals etc, and then you could order hot food from a menu. We tried pretty much everything over the 4 days including crepes, scrambled and poached eggs, bacon, mushrooms and beans, and we weren’t disappointed with any of the dishes. Everything was cooked fresh, tasted lovely and was presented very well. Overall I cannot recommend this hotel enough and we are definitely going to look out for these hotels when booking anywhere again. ","March 12, 2019","1    H10 Art Gallery

I also would not expect a “you must go downstairs to get your bottle of wine openned” response. All in all, It was way below expectation, nothing really stood out as really good.

76,"We spent a week at the H10 Art Gallery hotel in Barcelona.Overall our experience was great. The room was small, but we only went in to sleep and shower since Barcelona is such a wonderful city. The other minimal amount of time we spent at the hotel was at the rooftop pool, which was very nice and offered great views. Get there early if you want to get a good spot though as it is kind of small up there.The hotel was located in a fairly quiet area, away from much of the hustle of Las Ramblas. Taxi stand right out front and a metro stop a block away. We chose this hotel specifically on price, which was great. Since we planned to explore the city alot, we didn't require anything fancy, but this hotel went above our expectations. The employees were very nice and the hotel was very clean. The bathroom in the room was also very nice.We did alot of walking and came back some nights very late and never felt as if the area around the hotel was unsafe. Next time we might try to stay a little closer to a more ""major"" area, but if you don't mind walking a few extra blocks, this hotel is great.","January 18, 2019","1    H10 Art Gallery

The staff was really nice, and offered Champagne during check-in. I believe breakfast was 15 or 16 Euros which is not that expensive for a hotel. However, I recommend eating outside at a cafe where breakfast typically run 7 to 8 Euros. This hotel is only a few blocks away from Passeig de Gràcia (high end shopping and access to the train.)Overall it was a nice hotel, but the rooms are small.

81,"Would not recommend for a business trip. I was in a superior room, which was okay, but I wonder how basic the normal rooms were. The desk was very small, the Wi-fi in the room slow (faster in the bar) and not a proper chair to sit and work at.Service was mediocre the entire time across the entire hotel. The bathroom venting didn’t seem to do anything other than letting the essence of cigarette smoke come in to your bathroom periodically. On my second night I returned to find the voile curtain had been removed, which meant you had to leave the curtains closed in the morning as you would have no privacy. The following day two mismatched ones were installed in their place, but they didn’t fit so left a 30cm gap between them as they were too small; in essence same problem. They had fixed the large window that had a gap large enough to put fingers through, which on the first night I had to pack with tissue paper to reduce the external noise and breeze.Odd lighting situation, where the bedside light worked off the main switch so if you wanted that on you had to have the main ceiling lights on. I did enjoy the welcome glass of cava while checking in though. As of November 2018 there is construction going on next door which seemed to work through the night which while not massively noisy did disturb me. Rooms are small, barely enough room to do a cramped yoga session in the morning. I wouldn’t go back because of these things.","November 30, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

82,"Really surprises me that both the reviews and hotel website fail to mention there is a major construction project next door and it is VERY LOUD. Upgraded (and paid more) for a room to face Enric Granados as the interior room was very claustrophobic. The street view room was viewed at lunch and it was quiet b/c the construction was on break. Was awakened quite early the following morning to jack hammers, drills, etc. It would have been nice if the staff had informed of this.Note the interior rooms are quite small and no privacy due to the nature of the window facing the elevator courtyard and all other rooms. It might be good for one night but not for a longer period.The hotel is at a good location, amenities as stated, etc. The breakfast is extensive with eggs and hot dishes made to order, pastries, bread, charcuterie, cheeses, fruit, juices and coffee.In the end cannot recommend staying here due to the very loud construction.","November 20, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

83,"Stayed here for 2 nights as a group of 4 friends. We received a voucher on check in for a free cocktail to redeem in the hotel bar which was a nice touch. We had an internal room, which I was worried about as I have stayed in hotels before where you are looking at a brick wall, but this was nice as you had a door that opened onto a courtyard so it didn’t feel claustrophobic. The hotel is in a nice spot with a good choice of popular bars and restaurants on your doorstep, but it’s a lovely leafy quiet area. About a 15 min walk to Sagrada Família and other sights. Breakfast had a decent selection, can’t complain for what you got, as it was included in the price. Room was a decent size with a coffee machine and docking station and enough wardrobe space. Good bathroom amenities and a lovely shower and a great feature where a little light comes on when you walk in, which is great for the middle of the night not having to search for the light switch. My only complaint about the hotel, which did have an impact on my weekend was the bathroom door!! What a terrible design! It’s a frosted glass door, but it has at least a 1 inch gap where it is hinged so when it’s closed you can see right through. This wasn’t just our door, as our fiends door was the same and that’s the way it’s been fitted. You could hear and see everything, which when you are away with a friend it makes it quite awkward! That is the only reason I wouldn’t give the hotel 5 stars as it really was a hindrance. ","November 19, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

85,"We spent four nights in the H10 Art Gallery. Overall I would say that, for what we paid for, it was good value for money. The room, even though it was small and quite limited space, was really clean and well maintained each day by housekeeping. Fresh, modern interior and a nice bathroom with a really good shower. The bed was very comfortable. It has a lovely rooftop pool area which was perfect for chilling in the sun in the afternoon. Location wise, we felt it was well placed in terms of accessibility to all main tourist attractions. We could get to Las Ramblas in 15 minutes easily. We were able to get to all the various tourist attractions and areas of the city on foot, but close by are metro stations and bus stops. The only negative would be the breakfast. There was a small selection of cereals, fruits, toast/croissants etc and you had the option to order from a small menu. We were quite surprised that when we ordered scrambled eggs on toast, we were presented with a small, thin, disc of bread with some egg piled on top. It looked like it was trying to mimic some kind of fine dining. Not really necessary for breakfast. The restaurant manager had a bad attitude and was not welcoming at all.

We went down to reception at 3pm and asked and said they would send cleaning up st 4.15pm we rang down to say nothing has arrived , they arrived about 10 mins after that call but couldn’t do much as we didn’t have the facility to anything within the room and had to wait all day pretty much .

91,"We booked the hotel on booking.com but cancelled it after seeing the added value of booking directly to the hotel (free breakfast, cheaper price, free WiFi). In the end we still paid 150 EUR for a deluxe room with terrace, which isn't too bad for an August in Barcelona, but certainly not cheap either.We arrived at the hotel late at night, and weren't offered a welcome drink. At the reservation I made 2 requests: a double bed and a quiet room. Unfortunately we were given a tiny room, directly opposite the elevator which was poorly maintained. When I complained about this, the reception said that all the rooms with double beds and terrace were directly opposite the elevator; luckly the manager ""found"" a room a little further away from the elevator the next day. It was quieter than the first room, so well appreciated. The room similarly showed signs of damage: wall paper torn and stained.Be careful and know that all the rooms are extremely tiny. You cannot open 2 large suitcase in the room. There is only 1 small chair to sit on. The bathroom was OK in size, clean, with a good shower. However, they have annoying lights with sensors that go on an off if someone uses the bathroom at night, causing the other person to wake up. The best aspect of the room was the terrace and the location of the hotel in Eixample: plenty of restaurants and bars very close to the hotel. Don't rent the bicycles of the hotel (20 EUR/bike/day); there are cheaper options a few blocks away. I don't understand why they don't give the bikes for free use... The small pool on the roof of the hotel was nice as well.Breakfast is decent but if it weren't included in the room rate, I wouldn't pay extra for it.The main reason why I won't return is when we got to the room on our 3rd day, the room was made up, but the bed sheet showed a large stain (dried up blood? Melted chocolate? Who knows...) which is completely unaccepable. I went down to the reception and asked them to change the linen while we went out for dinner. 2 hours later we came back and found that nothing had changed. I returned to the reception and 15 min later they sent housekeeping who changed the sheets. No apology was offered at any time. Totally and completely unaccaptable. The small size of the room was a disappointment but my fault (I should have researched better); the unprofessional housekeeping is something I cannot tolerate. There are better options available at that price.","September 2, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

100,"What a fantastic experience at this wonderful hotel. We booked online direct through the hotel & signed up to their rewards program. We got a better rate than all the so called on line discount websites such as booking.com etc. On arrival the hotel had upgraded our room to a deluxe room. The rooms are not huge but nicely furnished with a great balcony. Beautiful bathrooms. Clean & refreshed everyday. The inclusive breakfast is amazing, so much choice and the staff super efficient and friendly. Situated a 5 minute walk from the designer shops of La Rambla. Highly recommended. Oh and a huge plus for me free champagne (Cava) every morning for breakfast. Win , Win. ","July 17, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

They have wonderful, clean common areas, a great pool deck and a very nice bar. The coffee makers in the room were such a nice touch. Espresso in the morning is a wonderful way to start the day. The hotel was within walking distance of shops and wonderful restaurants. This hotel set the tone for our visit to Barcelona.","July 11, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

102,"We absolutely loved this hotel, the staff here are fantastic and really care about its guests. We arrived around 10am but check in wasn’t til 3 but we were greeted with a choice of drinks and given maps and directions and they took our bags to store. The hotel is in a lovely area with a great selection of places to eat and drink and close to main attractions.When we came back around 4pm our rooms weren’t ready and we had to wait in the lobby for around 15 mins however for this “inconvenience “ we were given a voucher for 2 free cocktails in the bar.The rooms here are small but perfectly formed and there are very nice “Rituals” toiletries in the bathroom. Although this is a very popular hotel in a good location, it never felt crowded. While on our last day my wife fell over and was quite poorly, the staff on reception did everything to get us to the best hospital. It was also the day we had to check out but once again they came to the rescue finding the best price for another room on their website instead of just putting us on the rack rate.They also liaised with a supplier to get her a wheelchair when she came out of hospital - I couldn’t have thanked them enough!We had room service that night - just a club sandwich but it was tasty and flavoursome and not bad price for room service at 9.50€ - it came with a huge bowl of crisps.The breakfast here though was amazing - get the rate including breakfast as it will last you through lunch and all the way to dinner. Check my pictures but it doesn’t do it justice.... the bespoke omelettes are to die for!Planning another trip to Barcelona next year but will only stay here!! ","July 10, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

104,Very nice hotel in good central location.Just a little disappointed with the room size. We had the internal facing room and it's not big enough for two suitcases without having to step over them.Rooftop pool was nice but also small and gets crowded with just a handful of people.The outside beer garden is really nice and a good place for a cocktail and to get away form the bustling centre of Barcelona.Would stay again but on an outward facing room with balcony. But maybe the price will go up and there would be better options?,"July 1, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

Each floor of the hotel is based on a certain artist and their work which was fascinating.. and it just got a lot better when we went on the top floor & stubbled across a pool sweet little pool & gym.Breakfast here was amazing.. so yummy & plenty to choose from..the chefs clearly take pride in presentation cause it all looked 5*I would highly recommend this hotel!","June 21, 2018","1    H10 Art Gallery

Check in was efficient and friendly. We had 2 adjoining rooms and were so impressed by how stylish, spacious and comfortable they were. We ate numerous times in the restaurant and lobby bar and found the food to not only be tasty but incredibly good value.We all loved the rooftop pool and found it reasonably easy to get sunbeds. We found at this hotel, I suppose with it being a city location as opposed to a beach resort that even when it was busy, it wouldn't take long for loungers to become available. I would highly recommend and would definitely return.","September 9, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

109,"We stayed 3 nights in early September. The hotel is easy to find (every taxi driver we used knew where it was) and a taxi from Barcelona Santa train station is c€15.All hotel staff were friendly and helpful with incredible English. Decor of the hotel is very modern and chic. Great use of colour and pattern from the living walls in the restaurant, the artwork in the bedrooms and the varied seating areas on the rooftop. Hotel is very close to Basilica De la Sagrada Familia (c5-10min walk). Worth noting the tour buses have a stop there so very convenient should you want to use these.We hadn’t booked breakfast but ended up eating there everyday. Restaurant is again very modern in design and the variety and quality of the buffet is very good. We had a soggy afternoon during our stay but the hotel were able to lend us umbrellas. Nothing felt like a problem here. Rooftop was beautiful with great view of the Basilica and plenty of loungers/seats to capture the sun throughout the day. The pool wasn’t huge but perfect for a gentle swim to cool off. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends ","September 9, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

110,"Spent a Saturday night here in mid-July ahead of a week's cruise departing from Barcelona.This place is a real hidden gem- it's not far from the Sagrada Familia but you would think you are in a quite suburb rather then in the centre of a major European city. From the moment we arrived the staff were warm and welcoming, and we really impressed with the original design features of the hotel and the unusual furniture. Our room was also attractively decorated and spotlessly clean. We made use of the rooftop pool which has some great views over the city, and also went to the 5pm wine and cheese tasting in the main bar (be warned though- they only keep it out for 15 minutes). We didn't have dinner there but had breakfast the next day where there was a wide range of hot and cold dishes and service was very efficient. Overall very impressed and seriously good value for money.","September 2, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

111,"Beautiful hotel with fantastic amenities. Pool area is great and open until 9pm along with the terrace, Gerard was amazing bringing drinks to everyone he didn’t stop the whole time we were out by the pool.Rooms very nice, we had a mix up with our room I had booked a family room, we wanted the space and a large suite. When we checked into our room we found we had been allocated a triple room. This was adequately resolved but the room I booked had been given to a family of 4, they explanation that we were a family of 3 and had been moved wasn’t a relevant arguement in my opinion. We booked and paid for the suite we should have been allocated it. If I had been contacted before hand and told I was being moved to a triple and the price reduced to the price of a triple room I wouldn’t have argued and would have happily moved. Annoyingly the triple wasn’t even available to book when I made my booking!But alas the issue was resolved and it didn’t affect our stay and it wouldn’t stop me returning.The hotel is in a great location plenty of restaurants around and close to Sagrada Familia and metro stops.Would definitely return to this beautiful hotel.

112,I’m surprised by the super high ratings this hotel has. It was nice and if there was a 3.5 button maybe but no more. The rooms are clean and the beds comfortable. The air conditioner is weak and does not cool your room adequately. The upstairs pool is nice but you have to pay 5 Euro each for a pool towel and when you bring it back to the front desk even if you have the towels they wont give you your money back without a paper stub they give you. Hold onto that. There is no washroom by the pool. The front desk staff were generally nice but I have seen much better when we are talking 5 ratings. The lower level of the hotel is well done with a good outdoor sitting area. If I were to return to Barcelona I don’t feel that this would be my choice again. I would stay closer to the park. It just did not live up to its ratings.,"August 24, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

113,"We visited as a group of 3 girls and booked a triple room, this seemed to be a wheelchair accessible room which obviously had enough space for an extra bed. Room was lovely, plenty of hanging space for clothes and comfy beds - the only issue was the bathroom didn’t have ‘proper’ doors on only glass sliding doors so had some limited privacy. The lobby area is gorgeous with lovey furnishings and free wine and cheese at 5pm was a nice touch. We booked room only but had the buffet breakfast for two mornings which for €15 a head we thought wasn’t bad! There is a gym which mainly has cardio equipment. The rooftop pool was a lovely place to hang out for a few hours! The hotel has made the most out of the area with sun loungers and different seating areas, there is definitely a lack of a bar - but assume this is the case as it is a residential area. They did have a waiter around who could go down and get drinks from the lobby bar if you wanted so not too much of an issue.The location is fantastic to get to the Sagrada about 5 mins away, but is about 40mins walk to La Rambla - we mainly took taxis which was ok between us at around €10 a trip.We would definitely stay here again!","August 21, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

We all LOVED it!Not only was it a perfect fit for our brand/company, but also the service was extraordinary! The communication and planning prior to the conference was super easy and very professional, they made sure that all our requirements and needs were met. Also some extra wishes and last minute changes were no problem.The staff throughout the hotel (reception, conference center, restaurant, etc.) was very professional, we always had several persons around us that assisted with whatever we needed. We had a conference package with lunches and tea breaks and the food and drinks were excellent!We all loved the design of the hotel, the rooftop terrace for some free time, the breakfast lounge with the beautiful greenery!

There was a strange bathroom arrangement. It was in the room with only opaque glass walls that you could see right through. Made it very uncomfortable for us as we were traveling with our teenaged daughter. The breakfast wasn't included, but worth the price. It had a full scale buffet with excellent coffee.

Comfortable beds and fully supplied bathroom area.Staff were all friendly and helpful.The buffet breakfast was excellent, and plentiful. We fuelled up there for the day and didn't have much need for lunch after that.Food served in the bar (or to room service) was nice too, and cheaper than eating out at most of the restaurants in the surrounding streets.The rooftop pool is nice, but very small. It only took a couple of boisterous children to overwhelm it. The terrace is a pleasant spot to sit and relax for a while, even if the 'selfie point' doesn't have as good a view of the Sagrada Familia as you might expect from the hotel's description.Tourist tip - even if you wouldn't dream of exercising on holiday, the ground floor gym has a machine where you can fill your water bottle with chilly water before heading out into the heat!","August 7, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

119,"We stayed here for three nights following a cruise. The staff couldn't have been more helpful; they helped arrange for a private transfer from the ship to the hotel and, at the end of our stay, to the airport. Room was clean, modern, and very comfortable. True, the a/c won't come on unless you are in the room, but the hotel prides itself on LEED Gold standard so this is totally understandable. If you're there on a Saturday night don't miss the free one hour tour of the neighborhood focusing on Sagrada Familia. Our guide Juan was delightful. Every night at 5 there's a brief wine and cheese tasting (guests are limited to one glass of wine and the cheese disappears after 15 minutes so don't be late). Morning buffet breakfast (15 euros) is very worthwhile, and even includes champagne. Wednesday morning there's a free yoga class in the gym. Bikes and umbrellas are available for loan.

The personalization of honouring our birthday with a complementary bottle was appreciated. There are many spaces to relax in a unique atmosphere - the rooftop seating/pool, the lobby bar, and terrace on -1. We were particularly impressed with the breakfast buffet, espresso, and menu salads. The finishes throughout the hotel are thoughtful, stylish, and luxurious. The fragrance in the lobby is fantastic! At check out we appreciated the time to review our hotel charges. A few things that would have made our stay better: 1. After a hot day of travelling, we would have liked the ability to cool down the room quicker. The AC is locked at 21C, the fan is faint, and the cleaning staff ensure the AC is off when the room is unattended.2. Having the privacy of an additional door between the washroom sink and the hallway/room. The open concept isn’t practical for more than one occupant. Overall a great stay and we would recommend.

We then had to park the car down the block, run in the rain to get help with the parking then back around the busy block again. when we arrived in our room, it was very nice. we went to order room service and could not find the menu, when we phonen d the fron tdesk they explained that the menu was on the tv, fair enough. The menu was really not what we were expecting. all the food was health consious food that did not appeal to us, however we did go ahead and tried to order. we ordered 2 different things off the tv menu and the kitchen staff insisted that these items were not on the menu. we tried to explain that yes they were and we are looking right at them, even after we took a screen shot on our phone and showed them, they still insisted they did not make these items. after 30 minutes of back and forth i went across the street and got pizza as the hotel provided no vegetarian otions. my partner odered a sandwich in which the tomatoes were green. throughout our whole stay at this hotel they airconditioner did not work.

The rooftop is absolutely gorgeous with a stunning view of Sagrada Familia. There are free yoga classes on Wednesdays, daily wine tastings, and the hotel food is actually quite good. It's in a quieter area, which I liked, and has easy access to the city center via metro. I will stay here again on my next trip to Barcelona for sure!","June 12, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

134,"Loved this hotel. We are a family of four with two teenagers and stayed 4 nights.The room size was generous and the kids made up sofa bed was the size of a normal king size bed. Two sinks in bathroom helped.I believe there are only a few family rooms in the hotel so grab them while you can but wouldn’t take young children as not that type of hotel. Decor of whole hotel was stylish , makes you want to redecorate your own home.Roof top pool area is a fantastic facility - so calm and peaceful, lots of space and beds and great views. A few minor niggles - toilets not in use on roof top so had to go down 8 floors, no bar service by pool, bar area slightly brightly lit, long check out queue at midday - but for a four star hotel and for the price we paid, all this was very minor in the scheme of things.Want to come back (without teenagers!).

Found the front desk personnel very professional, always eager to assist especially with great restaurant recommendations, and friendly (well most of them). A great lobby with a cool vibe. Fantastic rooftop pool and lounge area with a view of the Sagrada Familia. Rooms were nice sized and well appointed. Really nice, large bathrooms. As others have mentioned, the location is great for touring the Sagrada Familia, but is away from the old town and beach areas. With that said, there were always taxis in front of the hotel with rides typically 8-10 euros to get to most places. Will stay here again next time in Barcelona.","May 30, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

138,"Well not sure where to begin. 25 th anniversary surprise set up by the blokes..After choosing 1882 as the stay over, bearing in mind there is a great deal of choice, I went for a Sa Grada view. Well “if its good enough for Gaudi its good enough for me”.The staff have been awesome they changed keys for us to allow the surprise to unfurl before the girls eyes, great at the bar and the door Anna gave us a recommend for Bar Mut- just don’t buy wine there The hotel foyer is welcoming with great looking seating - not the leather look that makes you look out of place when sat in it. Spend a couple of hours from 5pm on cheese wine order more drinks then hit the restaurant of your choice. Don’t forget to book if its special...Rooms are clean and functional beds are good guys but this hotel should be enjoyed on the roof in the pool lounging taking selfies looking across Famillia Barca. Then later downstairs in the bar area. Breakfast is a great set up with all that you could want in choice. It will get you to the first cafe stop of the day..I’m staying again when in Barca see you then 1882...","May 27, 2019","2    Hotel Barcelona 1882

139,"The staff is friendly and helpful. We had an incident with the bartender ( who doesn't work there anymore) and The manager was quick to remedy. Be sure to book with the morning breakfast buffet. Once afternoon we ordered the assortment of croquettes, grilled octopus with candied potato and the Iberian ham with bread and tomato with Cava and beer. The food is very good and all is reasonably priced. Go to the top floor deck for the great views, there is a pool, we didn't use as it was cold. The bar will run up drinks to you if you ask. There is a free walking tour- don't miss this & the gentlemen was wonderful. The hotel lobby and bar area is relaxing and cozy, we stopped here each evening just to sit with the house vermouth before heading to bed. Our room was also cozy ( we did take the peanut dish to use for the soap dish and took face clothes from another hotel bath room as these are not available) shhh..... don't tell.. The towels and product are nice, I rented a robe for 10 for the week and was worth it. My husband and I didn't have an issue with the bathroom as others have indicated in their reviews. The bed was comfortable and we slept well each night, having an inside room ( which didn't have any views) we were okay with that. Cheers to the staff who were very helpful - getting us directions and making suggestions to where to go. We had a fabulous experience at this hotel and would book there again.

156,This is the WORST experience I’ve had at a hotel. I will never ever stay at this hotel AGAIN. My sister and I walked into the hotel after hours of flying. We are two small girls and we had multiple bags with us. We were struggling to carry our bags to get into the hotel. The men at the front desk saw us visibly struggling to carry our bags and not one of them tried to help us.Once we checked in I asked if there was someone that could help us with our bags. The man at the front desk stated that “there was no one to help us with our bags” but I saw multiple people that worked at the hotel lounging around... the hotel also messed up our room. We requested two beds but they assigned us with a room with one bed.. and stated that the hotel was fully booked for the night.. I also had an issue when I was checking out. They stated that they would be charging my card 18 euros for “national calls” that I made. The only calls that I made was locally and that was to call the tourist office for an excursion I booked. The man at the front desk was very rude and I overall had an HORRIBLE experience at this hotel. I recommend anyone that is considering to stay at this hotel to find somewhere else. There are MUCH nicer hotels in Barcelona that actually have great hospitality. I repeat STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. They have the worst hospitality and the people at the front desk have the nastiest attitudes. This hotel is money hungry and will try to charge you for everything!Stay away from this place and use your money towards a nicer and classier hotel.

The pool is a welcome break from summer heat. It is quite small so you can't really swim far in it, but it has great rooftop views and is perfectly presented and enough loungers / deck chairs to sit out enjoying the sun. Bar and food service by the pool too in case of need.Staff are helpful and friendly. Didn't try the food as it was too pricey. But Audrey's cafe is nearby which is good for breakfast /Brunch /lunch (it's only 2 blocks down and 1 across). Plus plenty of local restaurants nearby. But do check on Google and trip adviser and their websites in case they are shut on particular nights (usually Sundays and Mondays) or don't open til 7.30/8pm. Some stay open more.

All staff were very friendly and approachable and couldn’t do enough to help you. Room was very clean and towels etc were replenished daily which I loved. In such a great location with lots to do around. The roof top pool was beautiful with a great view! Thank you so much for a great visit. We will definitely be back!!!!!!,"July 29, 2019","3    Hotel Astoria

It is an adorable, small, clean, lovely hotel centrally located just outside of the crowded touristy area but within walking distance to everything and the Metro station too! There is a beautiful little plaza right next door with great restaurants, a pharmacy and coffee shops. Be sure to check out Brunch and Cake! LOVE!","July 25, 2019","3    Hotel Astoria

177,"Hotel location was perfect. Only took a minutes to reach Diagonal Station. There are many Restorant and convenience market near the hotel.If you strong enough you can go to Sagrada Familia by walking. Its about 2.5 Km.I have done it and its worthed. I can see the beauty of Barcelona city during my walk. For safety, better provide yourself with the internet connection for road guideline. Its very comfortbale to walking around Barcelona. And during my stay, i never met bad people.Do you love liquoer? Its easy to find with cheap price. I bought 1 bottle oa sampanye and it only 1 Euro. Taste good. You can find itu at conveniece market (supermercat) near Astoria.Palea? Its one of food you have to eat.Iberico Ham and their seafood.It taste heaven.Souvenir?if you need to buy, you can find it around Sagrada. Various souvenir including magnet, keyholder, Barca thing ... and Gaudi Lizard. If you are lucky, you can but 6 for 5 Euro.Dont forget Barca merchandise. You can get cheaper price there than at Camp Nou. Of course the quality is different but its still worthed.TURRON is one of souvenir to bring. I find it near Sagrada but i dont have time to buy it. Closed at 9 pm. Too bad.Burger? there are plenty of burger there but FIVE GUYS is my choice. Taste and Price. ","July 5, 2019","3    Hotel Astoria

178,"This hotel is really a hidden gem. Reasonably priced for a weekend away. I went for a long weekend with my mother to celebrate her birthday. The building is in keeping with the Barcelona architecture and the inside is the same. Very friendly staff and checking in and out was very easy. The rooms are spotless with big fluffy towels and slippers for your comfort, mini bar is fully stocked everyday. Items like cola is quite expensive from the mini bar but the alcohol for a 50ml miniature is 5 euros. Which I find good. The room was cleaned daily by a lovely housekeeper, I only saw her in passing. We would pop out for an hour and come back to a clean room. The rooftop pool is bliss. They provide towels for the pool so you do not need to pack your own if you plan on using. There is only 6 sunbeds, 3 on each side with 4 beach chairs and 2 dining chairs. They could do with more sunbeds but if it wasn't for the 36⁰ weather that we had while there we may have not used the pool and the 6 sunbeds they had would normally be enough. I have trouble walking and use a stick for walking long distances and up and down stairs. Did not need to use my aid in this hotel as it is all serviced by lifts (apart from the communal toilets - which we only used on check out while waiting for transfer) the hotel is very central to 'Diagonal' metro station (5 min walk) and all the buses. There is a mini supermarket and tabaconist on the same road as the hotel so you never have to go to far. Overall a really good stay and perfect for a Barcelona city break!","July 2, 2019","3    Hotel Astoria

182,We stayed at the Astoria for 3 nights. We checked in early our room wasn’t ready but we left our bags and were told to come back around 14:00. The hotel is in a fairly central location around a 15-20 min walk to la Ramblas. The metro Diagonel is just around the corner with links to all parts of town a single trip costing €2. We got a taxi to and from the airport costing €25 each time but it would be just as easy to use the public transport if you didn’t have to much luggage. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean. The only downside we found was our room was number 322 which is opposite the lifts and right next door to the cleaners storage cupboards. We were woken every morning by a lot of banging and noise being made by the cleaners who maybe need to keep the noise down early in the mornings! Also our mini fridge in the room leaked every time we came back from a day out the fridge had leaked water on the floor. I asked to use an iron which reception provided but didn’t provide an ironing board ? So I had to iron on the floor on a towel! ,"June 11, 2019","3    Hotel Astoria

186,"When my husband and I travel, we normally stay at 4 or 5 star hotels. But after reading a number of reviews about this hotel, we decided to try it. My expectations were exceeded. It's a very clean, updated hotel situated in the city center. On my first day there, I took a walk around the block and found at least 15+ eateries (restaurants, cafes, tapas bars, bakeries, patisseries). Additionally, there's a mini market just down the corner. This location is walkable to Casa Mila, Casa Battlo, a street that is compared to the Champs Elysees in Paris called Passeig de Gracias lined with high end stores. We bought a bus card (10 euros for 10 rides) at the tobacco shop steps away from the hotel. Very easy to get around by bus. The hotel desk staff was very helpful as they have tickets available which we purchased for a flamenco show, Casa Mila, Casa Battlo and Park Guell (among others). They also work with an travel company if you would like to book an excursion as well. The only little downside is I wish they had complimentary bottles of water in the room. We did take one from the mini fridge (which was 2.5 euros), then headed to the nearby mini market to stock up on water. Also, breakfast at the hotel was 16.5 euros which I thought was very expensive especially since there are so many breakfast options nearby. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel.","May 28, 2019","3    Hotel Astoria

187,"Hotel Astoria was picked out for us by our travel agent, and we were so happy with our stay. We arrived at noon on a cold, rainy day. My husband was battling the flu and felt terrible. The helpful staff quickly got us a quiet, interior room and carried our bags up for us. The metal shutters on the window allowed us to block out all light, so he could sleep during the day.I loved the neighborhood around the hotel: easy walking distance to La Pedrera and the Diagonal subway stop, and a 25 min walk to Sants train station and to Placa de Catalunya. We ended up having the breakfast buffet every day at the hotel (discounted rate of 11 euros), because it was convenient, quality and we could make healthy choices. We also ordered room service twice, since my husband was ill and we didn't want to wait until 8 pm when many of the nearby restaurants opened for dinner. Staff promptly brought our tasty food and then took away our dishes.When you get sick on vacation, it's so wonderful to be able to rest in a quality, well-appointed hotel with attentive staff who speak excellent English (and a lot of other languages, too).","May 20, 2019","3    Hotel Astoria

188,"First off, my sincere thanks to Luis for making my stay extremely comfortable, and for helping me with checking up on things (either with a map or on the internet) that I wanted to include in my itinerary during my stay in Barcelona. Also, since I did not have a kettle for hot water in my room, Luis organised this immediately for the duration of my stay. In addition, when I had a problem with the noise from the terrace (I was in Room 826), and couldn't sleep the entire night of Saturday due to the noise, Luis and Domingo assured me that there wouldn't be any noise the next night, and if there was, to definitely call Reception, who would attend to it. Domingo was also very helpful and friendly. My interaction with Luis and Domingo is what made a difference to my stay at Astoria. During the day time shift, the front desk was busy, and not really interested in attending to me at all. Everybody else that I saw at Reception really didn't care to engage with me as a guest at the hotel. I'm not sure whether this has to do with my being non-white/Caucasian, or whether it was generally the attitude. I do not know whether I would visit Astoria again solely because of this reason.

I was shocked to see the tiny space which was supposed to be my ""Superior"" room. Barely any space to move around. Tried explaining this to the Hotel staff, but they didn't bother to help, or even hear me out properly. Breakfast at the hotel was too expensive for my taste - 16.50 euros per person per day.

194,"We visited Barcelona for a weekend recently and stayed at the Hotel Astoria. It is well located just a few minutes walk from the main streets, the open top bus tours pass nearby and there and some nice restaurants in the local area. The staff were friendly, the hotel very clean and quite impressive as you walk into the lobby and the breakfast selection was good.The big issue with it however is that it is an older building that has never been thoroughly modernised to be a hotel, so the doors on rooms and the windows to the streets outside are not well sound proofed. So when people arrive later at night you hear every one in the hallways outside your room. A number of the rooms near the top of the hotel also have loud air conditioning units or lift machinery adjacent, which would be very difficult for the average person to sleep through.I would probably give the hotel a poor rating based on this, other than the fact that there really are not that many modern hotels in the centre of Barcelona and at the price of the Astoria. So if you're an easy sleeper or just in Barcelona for a night or two it's actually an OK choice.","April 7, 2019","3    Hotel Astoria

Services, like printing PDF's from your room, is super fast and delivered with a smile. Love the oversize bath sheets in the bathroom--wow--they should sell these towels in the lobby. Slippers in the room are a plus. There are many pleasant restaurants in the neighborhood, including a few of my favorites: Bardot, Filete Ruso, Paco Meralgo. Best is the art: a lovely gallery of original Opisso drawings and sketches in the lobby, original posters from the 1900's in the restaurant, all in a modern setting.","December 27, 2018","3    Hotel Astoria

The workers at the reception did not provide any help, although there were video cameras right in front of them and they could at least see where the thief escaped. And it is not clear why in the evening there are strangers in the hotel when the restaurant is not working. All this suggests that the administration and thieves are in collusion.

First of all internet didn't work,our room 212 had only one spot where you can sit and get wifi,girls at the frontdesk tried to help but only thing that they offerd us was change the room,but based on what i heard from other people in the hotel,there was no point. It doesn't even work at the front desk!!!!!!!!! If you want to wash your hair ,just a little head's up ther is not conditioner in the room,bc they don't put it in the room(words of a girl from a front desc)so they called housekeeping to bring it after almost 20 min waiting!

220,"We were traveling as a family of four, two parents, one toddler, and his grandma. We stayed in this hotel for a week. Sergio in the front desk was friendly and accommodating. Rooms are very similar to the pictures, and provide a good night of sleep. However, we had a very disappointing situation with the breakfast service. The four of us went for breakfast, but my spouse and I ate very fast because we had to leave for a conference. Therefore, we grabbed a couple of small pastries for our toddler to eat later and gave then to his grandmother. Surprisingly, she was stoped in the elevator and forced by the waitress to put the small pastries back in the buffet! We have traveled the world, and this is the first time we encountered such a petty behavior. Also, I am not sure about the purpose of putting back food that was already touched by several people. It is an unhygienic practice that puts other guests at risk. For the record, we paid 10 euro each adult for the breakfast and 8 euro for our toddler, total 38 euros! Of course, this was our first and last time during our trip in Barcelona that we had breakfast at the hotel. By the way, there is a small locally owned restaurant that serves breakfast across the street of the hotel.","August 23, 2019","4    Capri by Fraser Barcelona

There are only a few options for food nearby that we found and it is a little bit far if you are walking from a metro station. We had two big suitcases and walked a good mile and a half to get there, which was our own fault with planning. But just so you don't make the same mistake, take a cab if you have a lot of luggage. We did walk from the hotel to La Sagrada Familia, which was not terrible. Just don't do it at night or with kids. It's fine if you are solo or a couple that doesn't mind walking a couple of miles. Room Tip: keep your curtains closed during the day while you are away, the sun made our corner room very hot with them open. If you keep the curtains closed it's fine, we did that the next day and it wasn't hot anymore.","June 29, 2019","4    Capri by Fraser Barcelona

Room equipment was very nice. Owen/plates/cutlery/toaster/kettle/frying pan/safe all here. Although toilet brush was missing.3. Retractable clothes line which is nice addition to anybody that's going to the beach.4. And that's pretty much it.... Now:Bad things:1. Hotel service doesn't respect your privacy. When you have do not disturb sign on, they will still enter and want to do the room.2. One day when the were even asked not to do room, they still did it and took a soap with them and didn't put a new one.3. When asked reception to deal with it I've got the soap. I've also asked not to do my room until I checkout, yet still my room was done.4. Ecology... Not a greatest thing. They still were changing towels even though they were not on the floor.5. Aircon wasn't cleaned for some time I guess. When I turned it on and left for an hour, room was stinking...6. It seems that my room was somewhere close to some smoking rooms. As every now and then I could smell cigarretes coming through vents... Not a pleasant experience.7. For some reason hotel is 'locked' and to get into the hotel you need either a hotel card, or call reception via bell which is slightly confusing if you've never been here before.8.

However, a few things will make our stay a lot more comfortable though - (1) The dryers in the facility doesn't work. There doesn't appear to have any vents to the dryer so the clothes never got dry even though the clothes got really hot in the dryer. Many of my clothes got shrank one size because of the heat but they never got dry.(2) The air condition didn't work in our room. It got really cold in the room even when we turned up the temperature. We spoke to the front desk twice. The second time, they acknowledged that the air condition is broken but can't be fixed until morning. We didn't know if it actually got fixed the next day or not. We just turned off the air condition.(3) We love the pressure of the shower! However, because of the strong pressure of the water, the shower head won't stay in position in the holder and it caused the water went all over the place in the bathroom. I could actually see some mold on top of the shower area. I think it must have been there because of the problem with the shower head.(4) The bathroom door stop is installed on the bathroom floor right in front of the toilet. It's really not a good place for the door stop. I tripped on it and almost fell in the bathroom.(5) My sister went to the front desk and asked if the breakfast was included in the stay. The front desk said yes. So we went downstairs to have breakfast but then was billed for the breakfast after we finished the breakfast. When my sister went back to the front desk to ask about the false billing, the front desk would not admit that they told my sister the breakfast was complimentary just an hour ago. Instead, they they just gave us a discounted rate. I'd much rather that they acknowledged the misinformation and certainly don't want to have other guests experiencing the same.","October 28, 2018","4    Capri by Fraser Barcelona

262,"We went on a family trip to Barcelona. everthing was just great until we arrived at Capri. First of all we received a room in a bad condition (room 007). Everything was broken or rusted inside. The second problem was that although we mentioned that we are traveling with two small kids the hotel did not have enough baby cribs. Arriving late in the afternoon we found ourselfs with a baby that has no place to sleep. We informed the staff which was very not responsive until we demanded to cancel our stay. Then out of nowhere they found a crib. We tought that the problem was solved. But then on our last night someone came and took the crib while I was putting the baby to sleep. The staff said that another family needed the crib and that there were again no cribs in the hotel. We again explained that an 11 months old baby can not sleep on the sofa because it can fall on the floor (a fact we tought does not require any explanations..). Again requested to leave the hotel. Again they found a crib. That was a really bad experience that could not have happened. The room is also not sutible for kids, like the shower that is not accessible for an adult that needs to shower his kid. The room does not look like in the picture. The equipment is old. The nice thing is that there a daily cleane. The free laundering and the gym is also very good. To summerize it is probably a nice place for couples but not for families.","September 14, 2018","4    Capri by Fraser Barcelona

265,"I had high hopes for this apart-hotel as the reviews were so good, but it just didn't meet my expectations. The Pros: 1) The decor (lampshades, cushions, throws, chairs etc) was modern and fresh. 2) The location was good, 15 min walk from Sagrada familia, near metro and loads of buses. 3)The Air-con in the room was lovely. The Cons 1) Mould in a bathroom is just unacceptable. It's so easy to remove so I was really grossed out to see it. 2) The bathroom itself was very tired. The door didn't close properly and we had a shoe on the inside to keep it closed. The soap dispenser at the sink leaked so we came into a large puddle/pool of liquid soap each morning/evening which soaked one of our washbags. Annoying that the cleaners didn't think to do anything about it. 3) The TV in the main bedroom didn't work. We didn't report this as we were hardly there but it should be checked. 4) The main TV remote didn't work properly. Got this replaced, but still didn't work. 5) At check-in the hotel requires that you present the credit card that you used to book the room. We booked in over 6 months ago and don't have that credit card anymore. Luckily I could take a screen shot of the transaction from an e-statement on my phone and email it to them then and there, but at check-out another couple were having the same discussion for their check-in. They didn't have such luck in having access to an online statement so I'm not sure what happened there. Since my husband called the hotel before to check bed layout (there were 4 of us and using the sofa bed) it would have been an idea to mention some of these mandatory check-in requirements then, or send an email confirmation beforehand as it's not normal for the actual credit card used for the booking to be required. 6) We had a service apartment but it was only 1 of the 2 days that it actually got serviced. 1st day, no beds made, no cups washed as you'd expect.I think there are better places to stay in Barcelona.","August 14, 2018","4    Capri by Fraser Barcelona

269,"Capri by fraiserHotel is simple with a modern flair and most importantly, clean.Rooms are comfortable, yet can be stuffy as the hotel does control the ac with minimum at 19 celsius. We had the one bedroom apt. The apt consisted of a small galley like kitchen with mini frig, microwave, stove top, and hot water kettle. It is fully equipped with dishes, coffee mugs, drinking glasses, silverware, pots and pans, and even a glass pitcher. It also has soap and sponge to wash the dishes. No dishwasher. There is also a table. The area is all open so you see the living room with sofa bed, desk and TV. There is a USB in living room by the desk to charge the phone, unfortunately mine did not work. I recommend you bring your converters, adapters, and power chargers to charge phones and iPads from the power chargers. There is a very small breakfast buffet. The price is 14.50 euros if purchased at the restaurant and 12.50 is purchased via the hotel. In my opinion, it's not worth the price. You can easily walk to a local cafe and get fresh bread and coffee etc. for much less. There is free wifi throughout the hotel.There is a gym nice size with water-cooler and towels, but no showers.There is a washer dryer room with a sink.","July 22, 2018","4    Capri by Fraser Barcelona

289,"This hotel was not in our shortlist. But a very attractive offer on a third-party website, and the good reviews landed us at this hotel. The good:First, you are very close to the tourist area, without being in it. The metro is a couple of minutes away. Lots of good restaurants in the area which are frequented by locals. So you get authentic local cuisine at non-tourist prices. Second, the front office staff is very helpful with directions, maps and advice. Third, I liked the late-check-out facility at a nominal additional price.Fourth, if you have an inside room, it is very quiet and the drapes are really black-out.The not so good:-Bed linen is gloomy, and the asymmetrical patterns on the ceilings resulting from the placement of lights and detectors are a bit disconcerting as is the placement of the air-conditioning unit. Also the air-conditioning takes ages to cool the room. The room itself is smallish.-Breakfast is just about okay. Fresh fruit , in a city known for it, was at best, very limited. Tea was not replenished regularly. And the spread was unchanging. The breakfast room too needs some cheering up.","June 4, 2018","5    Hotel Via Augusta

290,The hotel rooms are very no nonsense and have a hostel/dormitory style.We somehow got placed in a handicap accessible room that had a strange shower that did not drain properly. Since we only stayed one night we did not bother to ask to switch to another room.One thing to note is there was a lack of outlets in the room (there were none near the bed). The location is pretty good though because of the Gracia neighborhood and nearby Metro.,"May 17, 2018","5    Hotel Via Augusta

296,"I stayed here for 5 nights on a solo vacation trip. I picked this hotel based on its location - away from touristy areas, price and the good reviews on TripAdvisor. I had stayed in the Le Meridien prior to arriving here so was moderately surprised by the size of the room - small but comfortable. The location to me became a major advantage over the next 5 days, eventually. The local subway station (Fontana) is only a few minutes away and with a T-10 pass, I was able to travel to various go to spots in Barcelona, pretty easily - Kudos to the gentleman at the front desk for revealing this little secret on exploring Barcelona on a budget (sorry I forget your name but the person with the shaved head and glasses - very knowledgeable and friendly!). It is right across the Gracia area in a more residential part of town but with a lot of great restaurants and bars - all walking distance away.There is a McDonald's (McDonald's, Carrer Gran de Gràcia) and a Condi Express a few minutes walk across the Hotel for cafe Americano and supermarket needs. There is also a Fresh Laundromat less than a 5 min walk away (Fresh Laundry Travessera de Gracia).Room service was prompt and the front desk folks was quite friendly and conversant - learned a lot about Catalonia and the lifestyle, thru them (Thanks, Jordi and Leticia!).Ride to the airport from the hotel was about 25mins in the early hours (7ish) and cost about 36 euros.Overall, I enjoyed staying here and will stay here again, next time I visit Barcelona.","October 27, 2017","5    Hotel Via Augusta

301,I had booked a room at a hostel but that hostel was so loud and low quality that I immediately looked for a proper hotel to transfer to after quite some sleepless nights. I found Hotel Via Augusta and spent my last night there. I found out it is a 2* hotel but I'd give it one more star. It felt like heaven after that horrbible hostel experience. The room was very clean and mostly quiet and I slept wonderfully. The location was fine as it is close to the Fontana subway. Maybe the view was not the best as my room was an internal one but all I was looking for was some peace and I definitely slept like a baby.I might come back here.,"July 13, 2017","5    Hotel Via Augusta

302,"Have just returned from a 2 night stay Friday to Sunday. Doing my research before choosing this hotel really paid off. What an absolute gem of a place! Fabulous location, not a touristy area but so near to centre. Little delay on checking in but then given a great room on the 8th floor. A very spacious twin bedded room with black-out curtains, air con, safe in wardrobe, plenty of storage, flat screen tv with many channels in different languages, full length mirror and very comfy beds. Big bonus were the doors opening onto a sweet little balcony with table and chairs and views down the main road. The room was very quiet at night. Slept really well. Free wifi worked fine. Good lift to all floors. Bathroom was also spacious with bath and shower. Good water temp and pressure. Windows opened which is always good when it's hot. Nice toiletries supplied.Breakfast served till 10.30. What a spread. Selection of hot foods, cold meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, cereals, yogurts, cakes and pastries, rolls and toast, huge selection of hot drinks and very nice fresh juices. All fresh and replenished right up until 10.30. All staff so friendly and helpful. Happy to advise on buses and metros. Fontana Metro station 4 mins walk - handy supermarket and ice cream parlour on the way (this line L3 took us to nearly all the places we wanted to visit - got to know it really well!) 2 stops to centre of city. Had ordered BCN Hola 3 day card before leaving so just had to collect cards from machine at metro at airport. Really easy to get from/to airport this way. Used our cards many times on buses and metro so certainly good value for the cost (38 Euros for 2 people). I don't understand why this hotel only has 2 stars - I've stayed in 3 and 4 star hotels that were not as good. I have already recommended this hotel to friends and I can't wait to return to Barcelona (what an amazing laid back, friendly city) and will definitely stay here again. To finish I would just like to say thank you to the lovely staff, especially on reception, for helping us have a truly memorable stay. See you next time!","July 3, 2017","5    Hotel Via Augusta

Sound proofing in the rooms is poor. When neighbour showered we thought our water was running due to the noise. Breakfast choices were very poor. Fruit was tinned and breads and pastries were not very fresh.Staff friendly and helpful. Location was adequate. There was limited access wifi for free but, connection kept dropping out. Over all, this was adequate to provide a one night stop over but, not suitable for a longer stay. Not good value and we will not be staying there again.","June 24, 2017","5    Hotel Via Augusta

320,"A family member had stayed here and recommended it. We looked at many places before booking the Via Augusta, and they all seemed VERY over priced if all you want is a good base to stay. But the Via Augusta seemed to fit the bill! At the airport train station, we bought a 5 day 'Hola BCN travel card' which you can use on the busses and trains. It worked out much cheaper. We caught trains from the airport and walked from Fontana metro. I will say that to find it, the instructions on the hotel website, were not clear to us and we got a bit lost! When you come out of the Metro, turn left and walk down until you get to Rambla del Prat on the other side of the road, walk down there, turn left onto Via Augusta, cross over on the crossing and the hotel is a few meters down. The staff were all very helpful, informative and welcoming. We actually booked a twin room as we thought the doubles looked like only 4ft 6 beds. Our room was on the 9th floor, 906. We had views over the rooftops and could see over to Montjuic, and over to the hills in the North. It was not a large room, but was all we needed as we intended to be out all day. There was a small desk and chair and plenty of space in the wardrobe, plus shelves and a suitcase stand. The bathroom was clean and had a bath too which was nice. The shower had good pressure, although it did go cold on me a couple of times. We were impressed with having daily maid service too. The room was quiet and the beds comfortable, which was a nice surprise, as often more reasonably priced/2* hotels have rock hard beds! The air con worked well. The free wi-fi had a good signal and was certainly fast enough. There is also a computer in reception if you need to print out any tickets which was useful. There is a free to use safe in the room. There was a small roof terrace which would be nice to have a beer in the good weather. There is one lift for guests. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, I think it would have been 8Euros, we preferred to do as the locals do and have a coffee and mini filled roll in a cafe, which is enough for us and cheaper!The location suited us very well. We actually walked all the way down to the waterfront, down through La Rambla, about 4k. It was a great introduction to Barcelona! We caught busses and metro's and the location of the hotel was never a problem. The only thing we felt would have been nice to have provided in the room, was tea and coffee making facilities. However, we knew there were none when we booked, so we brought our own.I would certainly highly recommend the Via Augusta if you want a quiet, comfortable, clean, base to explore Barcelona. If you want luxury, this hotel isn't for you.","October 24, 2016","5    Hotel Via Augusta

We took taxis around so didn't use any public transport this time. Would highly reccomend this hotel!! ,"July 1, 2019","6    Condado Hotel Barcelona

327,"This hotel was very clean, affordable, accommodating, and supplied a large, diverse breakfast for 12 EU. The staff was very helpful and even made a couple of calls for me about locating a meeting place for a walking tour. The computer area was quiet and easy to access. The Hotel Condado is close to good restaurants and a mini-mart, but a ways to the red/orange/green bus lines, especially if one has walking issues. It is quiet, clean, and provides rooms that are compfy, and roomy, and have lots of closet space, shoe racks, safes, etc. We had a balcony, but it looked out to other apartments across the way.

332,"We had a beautiful large room on the 6th floor with a shower as requested. The shower was one of the best I've ever had, with a large shower tray. Regular wooden door to the bathroom area with a glass door to the toilet inside it so no problems with modesty. The window was treble glazed so no noise from the street which we were facing. The beds were comfortable and we slept well, 2 single beds pushed together and made up separately which was what we preferred. The staff were very professional and friendly, any requests were acted upon quickly. All reception staff spoke good English. The room was clean and towels were changed daily.There were 2 small fridges in the corridor with free bottles of water. Large safe in the room. If the bottled water runs out you can always find some on the ground floor. We brought our travel kettle as knew there were no tea making facilities in the room. There is a very good supermarket across the road and a bus from Las Ramblas area stops 70 yards from the hotel so easy to get back from the centre.

The breakfast although continental was of a great standard with something for everyone, they had hot scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages so you’re not limited to just cold foods .

348,"This is a brilliant hotel for exploring Barcelona. We stayed for 5 nights. The area is quiet, but with lovely restaurants and shops nearby. Our room was small, but spotlessly clean. The rooms have air con, which is powered by the room key inserted into a panel on the wall, along with the electricity. There was a small desk, tv, and wardrobe in our room. The bathroom was clean, with a lovely powerful walk in shower. Word of warning, the toilet roll holder has sharp metal edges, and I scratched my arm a few times on this. There are fridges in the corridors that have free bottles of water. There is a washing and ironing service provided by the hotel for an extra cost. Breakfast is also extra. We didn’t try the breakfast as there are many cafes and bakeries around the hotel.There is also a supermarket just across the road that came in handy for snacks and drinks. Unfortunately there is no restaurant on site, but lots of nice places to eat within walking distance. We used public transport for our entire stay. Very cheap and reliable. I’d recommend the T-10 ticket for €10 which allows 10 journeys on all public transport including the bus and metros. Lots of buses run down the Diagonal street, which is great for getting to the tourist areas. We used a transport app called Moovit and I’d highly recommend using something like this. It makes using public transport an absolute dream. Another word of warning, the metro is a hotspot for pickpockets. We unfortunately witnessed an older gentleman have his wallet stolen out of his trouser pocket while using the metro. I’d recommend using a secure bag with a zip.We used the Aerobus to get to the airport from the hotel. It picks up from Plaça de Catalunya every 10 minutes and costs €5.90. If you don’t want to walk to the Plaça with your suitcase, there is a bus from the next street that stops there. Overall, this hotel is perfectly located to visit Barcelona.

It is near key bus stops and allows for easy walking into Gracia (a great neighbourhood to eat and drink in plus we were there for their fiesta which is brilliant - more luck than judgement... ).

There is a good supermarket Mercador right in front of the hotel, a lot of cafes around and a disco club and sports gym in front of it.

The hotel is within a walking distance from Diagonal subway station, from where you can travel easily to other parts of the city. As for negatives. There wasn't an own fridge/minibar in the room. There are only common ones in the hallways. And the blankets in the beds could be a bit thicker. Now they were more like bed sheets.

However a mini fridge in the room would be a good addition although they do have mini fridges outside the room which they stock with free water bottles which is a nice touch. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. The receptionists were always willing to help and greeted us with a smile every time we saw them. Breakfast was nice. A little variation in what is served everyday would improve the breakfast but apart from that, it can’t be faulted. It is in a central location. About a 5 minuet walk from a train station which takes you to Plaça Catalonia where you can get most forms of transport that Barcelona offers. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. I recommend parking pizza which is about a 10 minuet and does the best pizzas. Also there is a bar/restaurant opposite the hotel which do great burgers and sangria. There is also a supermarket which is opposite the hotel which supplies everything you may need.

We were only there for four nights, and spent little time in the hotel but it was clean, had comfortable beds, and the room was ample. Our only window opened into what can be described as a “shaft” which gave a little light and you had to lean out to see what the weather was like, it didn’t trouble us but maybe others would prefer rooms with views onto the street. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful but they could do with smiling a bit more.

366,"I have just spent a week at the Condado Hotel, Barcelona, which I booked through EasyJet winter holidays some months ago. I wasn't sure what to expect of the Hotel, other than what I read from other reviews. It was given a 4 star rating, and was considered close to the the well known sites. The reviews weren't far wrong. It was not typical of your Costa type hotels, but more of a professional business type hotel catering both for travellers and business people attending meetings in Barcelona. I found the hotel well cared for and clean with nice decoration and facilities. The staff were very helpful and most spoke English well if you had a query. The rooms were very clean and maid service was daily ensuring new towels; shampoo & shower gel; as well as making beds etc. One of the bonuses of this hotel for me was on each floor there were a number of small fridges providing free bottled water to use in your room or take out with should you feel thirsty. I booked daily breakfast for my wife and I, which was more than adequate with continental breakfast; scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages; fresh fruit, yoghurts, cereals etc. The location of the hotel was quite central, with a 15 minute walk to the main shops and 30 minute walk to La Sagrada Familia church. Although we walked everywhere, there were buses and trams in the vicinity if you wanted to go further afield. The main road near to the hotel, is called Avenguda Diagonal, which by its name travels in a diagonal length across most of Barcelona. This Avenue is tree lined with beautiful walkways throughout its central area. It has many benches for sitting down if needed. I found it useful to use this avenue as my focal point to get about Barcelona without being lost. After a couple of days walking, I found my bearings with the area and was able to make my way to many of the sites around the central area of Barcelona. All in all, the Hotel Condado was very convenient with lots of supermarkets and restaurants in the nearby area. I would definitely use this hotel again. The only pointer I would mention as I wasn't aware of it before travelling to Barcelona, is that there is a Tourist Tax in force that all tourists have to pay. This was brought to my attention as I was checking out of the hotel. For the week, I had to pay €10.01 for the privilege of staying there. Not a fortune but be aware of this before booking.","November 3, 2017","6    Condado Hotel Barcelona

367,"We booked this hotel after a recommendation from friends. The hotel was ok it was clean and the beds were comfy. There were complimentary shower gel and shampoo and house,eeping did a great job when they looked after the room.Unfortunately we realised that this hote was a bit too basic for us, we usually choose a hotel a bit more luxurious but as the reviews were alright and our friends had been we thought it would be fine. There wasn't anything specifically wrong with it but it was just a basic hotel.The best bits were fridges with bottles water free to everyone every day, the reception staff were informative when asked for help although didn't volunteer anything without asking. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty wardrobe and cupboard space.The bad bits were it's a good fifteen minutes walk from the metro and a good way from the airport bus stop and the train station to the airport. It's also on a madly busy road which is always expected in a busy city and the substantional double glazing helped with th noise. We have stayed in lots of city hotels and have always accepted the noise as part of the holiday however right across the road from our window was a night club. On the second night were were kept awake from 1am until around 5.30am when the club emptied. We decided we couldn't stay in that room again and asked to be moved. We were told we could but had the inconvenience of having to pack everything and leave our cases at reception for the day until a room could be found. When we got back that evening we had been given a room at the back which was much quieter and a lot nicer. Unfortunately we were leaving the next day somdidnt really unpackmproperly again. We slept a bit better.Overall we definitely wouldn't return to this hotel but it was a decent price for an expensive city and was clean and comfy. We would probably chose something a bit nicer and a better location but I think for some, like our friends, it could be perfect it's just not for us.","October 30, 2017","6    Condado Hotel Barcelona

Only downside I had was I put some fizzy juice in the fridges that supply free water on floor and someone took it (not hotels fault). Great location in Garcia and within walking distance to all attractions if you are not afraid of 25 to 40 minute walk. Transport available near hotel although didn't check these. Near to train station and metro for getting around and to airport. Good selection of breakfast items continental and hot. A little pricey though I got a great deal for the accommodation including breakfast. Very quiet at night as room was away from traffic noise. Would book this hotel again if visiting again. In addition the tour buses were great to get around as we used if first day and lets you get off and back on at various stops throughout the day.","September 6, 2017","6    Condado Hotel Barcelona

Rooms were clean and bigger than I thought I was going to get. Breakfast was good as well, everything you need for continental and cooked. Breakfast was updated by staff all the time and I have to compliment the gent who looked after the breakfast as he never stopped cleaning tables and keeping the food at the breakfast table up to date. Also the reception was very clean and had fresh iced water for anyone to use. The bonus for us was the unlimited supply of bottled water in fridges on all floors.

376,"My young adult daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights to explore Barcelona before a great bike trip with Creative Catalonia.We then returned for one more night 10 days later and it was like coming home to family!!!The rooms are quiet with great double paned windows. We were on the 6th floor facing the street and I am a very poor sleeper.With ear plugs in, the street noise was barely audible until 7 am when the mopeds were operating- time to get up and explore this wonderful city by then anyways.The staff are very professional, helpful and go out of their way with their clients. Treat them with respect and a smile and the staff will reciprocate. Their manners are much more formal than in North America, but please don't misunderstand this as being ""cold""- that is not the case.I like hot herbal tea before bed, so although there is not those facilities in the room( very common in Europe), I went to the front desk staff each night with my tea bag and travel cup, and they were more than happy to prepare this for me in their breakfast room.We always felt safe in the neighbourhood, and the staff are quick to observe the comings and goings at the front door as far as clients that are entering.The water bottles on each floor were a godsend as it was 35C for several of those days.","July 17, 2017","6    Condado Hotel Barcelona

379,"We booked the hotel through easyJet and were a bit skeptical as we are a young couple who wanted to be in the centre of the city and saw a few reviews saying the location was bad and out the way. Turns out the hotel is in a great location! It is a 5-10 minute walk from a quiet beach, which has a beach bar that serves amazing food, and also a 5min walk from a huge shopping centre that has a Zara, Bershka, Sephora, pull and bear, a supermarket and a load of restaurants etc. The surrounding area is quiet, and more of a locals area. It also feels safe at night. In terms of getting to the city centre, the hotel is near two metro stops which are on line 4 and take about 10 mins to get into the city centre. The metro is extremely easy to use. It costs about €2.20 for a single journey. Despite also being told the metro is bad for being pick pocketed, we didn’t experience this at all and never felt unsafe. The hotel itself is extremely modern and very clean. Our room was a standard room and was lovely. We had breakfast included which had a massive variety and was also tasty. The hotel has a roof top pool and a few sun loungers which is nice, although we didn’t really use it as we preferred the beach. Staff were friendly and informative. I would definitely return!","September 15, 2019","7    Hotel Barcelona Condal Mar By Melia

Shower was hot and powerful and towels were nice and clean, replenished when we needed them to be. Breakfast was delicious and very relaxed. Walked to Barcelona but it took about an hour they're are always taxis outside the hotel which usually cost around 13-15 euros into the city so it's expensive but there was 3 of us so wasn't too bad.

But this wasn’t the case we had stayed in this hotel for 11 nights and I have to stay it was not what it seems on the website. The shower was terrible i had turned it on to find out it was only dripping no pressure at all from the shower head. Therefore I had to go to reception for them to change my room and they did but the shower wasn’t that great from the previous room. Also I had notice that when the cleaners had cleaned my room they had not checked under the tv stand or under the bed for dust. I had mentioned to the reception staff that this had not been cleaned and that there were gonna get someone to clean it straight away that was not the case no one had cleaned it.

384,"The experience of booking the hotel was good. It was my partners birthday and I wanted it to be special. When we pulled up to the hotel, the area was not great the taxi driver warned us that it was not a nice area, however said the hotel was beautiful. The place it’s self beautiful, the staff at reception incredibly helpful and the booking in process incredibly slick. When we got to the bedroom to the bedroom that also was amazing. In the morning we were greeted and shown to our seats. The provision of tea and coffee was not as clear and we struggled to get the milk and coffee until well into breakfast. The food was pleasant, however the topping up of certain intense such as cold meats and cheese was slow leaving many little choice for continental. When we finished breakfast we went up to the pool and terrace bar.... despite being just gone 10 o’clock (the earliest you can get to area and find somewhere to settle on a sun bed)... we were shocked to discover that neither this bar, nor the main bar on the ground floor was open to sell drinks...no water, no coffee, soft drinks... NOTHING. I asked in reception if this was correct and perhaps there was a vending machine to catch the period between end of breakfast and 12noon (once you are out of the breakfast area you are out!!). NOTHING!! I went back to the mini bar in desperation at circa €5 euros per drink, ideally you wanted something more... but needs must. Once open one of the days the barman from the night before “forgot” to leave a key for the soft drinks cupboard... so for the first few hours that was a limited choice also. We ordered a pizza for lunch, this was not pleasant, despite being hungry we barely managed half a pizza between us... excluding everything we had removed in a separate pile which was inedible!! - it was tasteless and bland. We spoke to the bar staff, but whilst they acknowledged little had been eaten wasn’t really interested. The club sandwich the following day was better but still not brilliant. The room service we ordered that evening was vile... the french fries were over cooked and reheated potato bites... they were disgusting!! They were so bad no amount of salt/vinegar could salvage them and the smell from old cooking oil left us both beeping nauseous. Don’t get me wrong the hotel and room were great. But such little things could have saved this trip!!Fast forward to checkout.... Smith and pain free no issues with settling the mini bar bill (from the previously mentioned drinks drought). We handed the keys back and the front desk team were kind to allow us to have a complimentary gym pass until we were picked up that (early) evening.That last day we stayed on the rooftop and relaxed... the gym equipment barely worked, was in poor working order that said it was complimentary but I am just illustrating again how little things make it difference... the showers and toilets post work out had no way of ensuring privacy of someone else coming in!!! And stunk of mould/poor drains. Now fast forward to being home... I check my bank balance to discover two transactions from the hotel... 1) authorised amount for the room 2) £137... I email the hotel to receive a prompt apologetic response advising the amount had been credited to my account. No explanation but an apology. The next day I check my account... £4 short. Now I know it’s only a small amount, potentially the strength of the £1 with recent Brexit events could have affected this... but when I emailed the hotel saying where is the full refund I got a short sharp response “we’ve refunded you - we’ve already told you so”. I responded with a screenshot to illustrate I was out of pocket...nothing back. Regardless of why this happened, this is poor. Communications ceased. Would I recommend the hotel... yes, would I recommend the experience of staying... NO!!","August 24, 2019","7    Hotel Barcelona Condal Mar By Melia

387,"I stayed here for 3 days in July with a group of friends. We were all on floor 6 with 7 of us sharing 3 rooms. On our first day I put a number of items including my ipad in the safe in our room however we could not get it to close as it was faulty. We left the room at 11.00am and went to the lift which was about 5 metres away, while we were waiting our other friends appeared and we decided to use their safe as it was working. I went back into the room to get the items in the safe to move them. However in the time we had been out the rooms which was not more than 5 - 10 minutes the ipad had been stolen. Someone with a key to the room had gone in and stolen the ipad from the broken safe.When I reported this to the manager Susana Jimenez we were told someone would fix the safe and they would check the records of who entered the room. However when we went back to the room the safe has not been fixed and the manager advised there was no record of anyone entering. The manager further advised none of their staff would take anything and nothing they could do.The hotel clearly has a security issue. Our room was accessed with a key and the thief went straight to the broken safe. The management were clearly not interested and for this reason I do not see this issue being resolved. We lost most of Friday dealing with the broken ipad as we had to report it to the police station and did not get out until 2.45pm.The staff advised they would approach their insurance company however they confirmed they would not pay out despite both the negligence of the broken safe and the room being accessed by a key.I would not recommend staying at this hotel as I felt the management attitude to the theft would mean it could happen again. I have stayed at Melia group hotels before and had good experiences however I would not recommend the group again if my experience at this hotel represents their brand.I travel internationally professionally for work as do all the people I was travelling with. I have been lucky so far to never have had anything stolen until I stayed here - so a very upsetting experience made worse by the poor attitude of the management.","August 12, 2019","7    Hotel Barcelona Condal Mar By Melia

The staff in the hotel were all genuinely quite pleasent and very helpful, however the staff at the pool area at times where very rude and I could find myself waiting 10 minutes for a drink despite being the only person at the bar.

Also after we checked out the hotel I checked my online banking to find I had been charged on my card by the hotel but was not sure what for. I called the hotel and was told it was for 2 drinks out the minibar which I DID not take.

I really don't like it when you hear and feel the mattress springs.Breakfast was good with a wide choice of food.Rooms have air conditioning but in the lift and corridors it can be hot. There is a nice pool and great pool bar but unfortunately it closes at 00:00. There is really nothing else in the neighbourhood so you will have to take the bus to the city centre.Would give a 3,5 quote but this is not possible.","July 6, 2019","7    Hotel Barcelona Condal Mar By Melia

No coffee, and toiletries as you would expect. The breakfast was very good. However, big disappointment with not being allowed to take coffee or even water up to my room! Some weird policy!

409,"We stayed in the Condal Mar for 4 nights in May and had a fantastic stay. It was unfortunately a little too cold to sit by the pool but the views are amazing and having a bar and music on on the roof are really nice features - this would be excellent in the summer! We didn't use the spa facilities either but these are another bonus!The rooms are really modern, spacious and have a snack bar, hairdryer, shower creams etc. in the room if needed. The bed is also really comfortable. It was quite noisy early in the mornings as the doors slam very loudly and you could hear loud voices in the corridor (I think the cleaning staff) but overall we slept very well.The location of the hotel is not the most ideal if you intend to sightsee a lot, although there is the option of public transport. We walked to the Sagrada in about 40-45 minutes for example so it is doable but can be a lot of walking!We would definitely stay at the Condal Mar again for a more relaxing holiday by the pool and it's only 10 minutes walk to the beach too with lots of restaurants and bars. The beach is also much quieter than in the centre which is really nice. It's also close to the Diagonal Mar shopping centre with numerous restaurants so you are spoilt for choice!We booked our stay with last-minute.com and everything went very smoothly including our transfers and the whole booking process. I would definitely recommend.","May 11, 2019","7    Hotel Barcelona Condal Mar By Melia

The hotel is modern clean with a great breakfast choice. The upgrade options were a little annoying as I would expected to have a kettle already in the room and not have to pay for a better room for a kettle. That said the was fine, it is situated 1km from the beach which is a great walk to the harbour approximately 3/4 miles.

For lunch and dinner there is a snack menu which I found suitable but many likely would not.Lots of places large and small within walking distance and a 5 minute walk to Av. Diagonal.The hotel is oval, and the rooms are on the oval so the room shape is a bit strange. The room decoration is functional but plain (fine by me). The room was plenty big for me, but would probably be tight for two.

432,"I recently spent 8 nights at this hotel (1 extra night, thanks to BA strike). The staff at this hotel were fantastic - friendly, helpful & good at communicating when I had to extend my stay at short notice. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Clot metro & you can travel 2 stops from there to Sagrada Familia or walk there in 15 minutes. There are plenty of shops, restaurants & a laundromat on your doorstep. My room was clean & the bed was comfortable & I had a decent shower in my bathroom (once I figured out the 3 different shower heads). Unfortunately, I do have a few gripes, the first being the fact that there were no plugs near the tea/coffee tray, which meant that I had to plug the kettle into a plug in front of the door to my balcony, on the floor or the other option would have been on the shelf at the head of my bed. I would have also appreciated a full length mirror outside the bathroom, instead of a full length picture. I was glad that I took my hairdryer, even though a hairdryer was advertised on the website. The hotel dryer had about as much power as a butterfly flapping its wings on my hair! Recently, when I stayed at a brand new hotel in Amsterdam, one of the staff told me that they all stayed in the hotel before it opened to guests, to see where it might be improved & experience it from a guest's perspective. Brilliant idea! I think all hotels should do this, maybe once a year & get a male & female perspective on how a room might be improved. My stay was pleasant enough, but I marked the hotel down slightly, due to the niggles mentioned.","September 15, 2019","8    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

441,We loved our 3 day stay at the Leonardo Boutique Hotel. Our room was clean & cozy. We loved the big shower in our bathroom. The Breakfast buffet was amazing with so many choices. Coffee machines also had many choices. Just a great way to start our day each morning. The location was great & close to the metro station & the Sagrada Familia. We were able to take a short taxi ride to the Cruise ship dock from this hotel as well. We would stay here again should we ever be back to Barcelona.

443,"For overseas tourists, the most important criteria is location.This hotel scores full marks for that. It is within short walking distance to the Clot Metro station. From there you are connected to the entire Barcelona, places of interests, etc. The El Clot-Arago Renfe train station is also nearby which connects to Barcelona Santa for onward train connections to other cities and Barcelona International airport or Aeroport.The staff were friendly and most helpful with whatever questions you may hv. For €9, you can avail yourself to their decent albeit limited budget breakfast.Room was comfy, clean and well maintained. The free WiFi is good.Just next door to the hotel is a supermarket with super afforded prices for take away food such as roast chicken, BBQ pork ribs, sandwiches, pastries, drinks, etc. There are plenty of cafes around too.Recommended by a seasoned traveller.","April 24, 2019","8    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

444,We have just returned from a 5 day break in Barcelona we booked in on Monday 15 April 2019- we chose this hotel for the location but we were unsure when we researched the area on google maps - first impressions around the area looked suspect - however it was a fabulous stay - the hotel smelt fresh in the corridors and impeccably clean - staff very welcoming and friendly - welcome drinks when you arrive and complimentary fruit and water every day in your room - it was a triple room and super clean - modern wooden floor and super size bed ! Slept like s log ! - no noise - every day our bed was made up - wonderful! Continental breakfast was overwhelming- friendly polite staff food all topped up from fresh fruit to scrambled eggs ! Lovely - roof top terrace imagine it to be stunning in the hotter months - this hotel is about 4 mins to Clot rail station - super service literally every 4 mins a train arrives - we bought T10 ticket gets you 10 journeys per person - brilliant - we went all over Barcelona totting up over 28 miles walking ! The Sangrada Familia ( unfinished church) is in this location it is a masterpiece - about a 12min walk from the hotel - lots of tourists congregated around the church - police on guard for security- some pleasant shops we spent half a day looking around - lovely - everything was great - highly recommend thank you Barcelona!,"April 20, 2019","8    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

445,"I recently stayed in one of the suites in this hotel along with my elderly parents. First of all the hotel was accommodating with an early check in, about an hour before which was great, as we were pretty weary from the travel. We were also able to store luggage allowing us to grab lunch before check in. The area was safe. It is good to note that if you rent a suite (which is essentially an apt) that the entrance is in the back of the hotel. It’s a little bit of a bummer than you can only pass through the connecting hallway of the building for breakfast, otherwise it is locked and you have to walk around the hotel to the front. Breakfast was good. The staff were very nice. There was free espresso, water in the lobby which is awesome. Importantly the hotel was quiet and clean, about a 20min walk to Sagrada. Very easy to hail a cab as well from across the street of the hotel. Metro is around the corner. I would recommend.","April 14, 2019","8    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

The rooms are small and we had opted for the private balcony. These are not really worth bothering with as the views are not great. The biggest issue was that you can hear everything in the rooms above, below and around you. There seems to be a lack of any insulation or sound proofing! Overall cleanliness is good and the rooms have everything you need, just a lack of space.","November 30, 2018","8    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

460,"Stayed here for 5 nights whilst in Barcelona for a holiday and Primavera Sound festival. The hotel is ideally located right next to Clot metro station and a couple of minutes from Clot Arago station which connects directly to the airport. We could be in the city centre or at Parc del Forum within 20 minutes. There are a couple of supermarkets and cafes/bakeries right next door and lots of restaurants within a few minutes walk from the hotel.We stayed in a suite which are in a separate building directly behind the main hotel and have their own entrance. We were not disappointed, it was very spacious with separate bedroom and living area with a well equipped kitchen and our own private terrace with seating which got the sun all afternoon. The bathroom was clean and modern with an excellent shower. Bed was comfortable with lots of storage in the bedroom and black out blinds which were ideal for sleeping late after the festival.The main hotel also has a roof terrace with sunbeds.Only slight downsides were the lack of any washing up/cleaning products for the kitchen but we found that house keeping would often wash up our cups/plates etc. Also you aren't given a key for the main door and have to buzz the main reception when coming back in giving your room number. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay and I'd definitely recommend the suites to anyone else and would stay here again. ","August 16, 2018","8    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

481,"We stayed for 7 nights at this hotel. On arrival we had a cold drink and a chocolate each given at check in. Rooms were very clean. On arrival to our room there was a free large bottle of water and apples. Our toiletries were replaced daily as we're our top sheets. Quiet location. Breakfast had a big selection but was mostly the same everyday. Kept warm was eggs, bacon, sausage and Spanish omelette. There was a Bread selection. Pastries including croissants and doughnuts. Then there was cereal, dried fruit and yogurt. There was a large Nespresso machine, fruit juice and water. Helpful staff who always answered our questions. Lacks a pool. It if you ask for a small fee you can use the pool and sun terrace at the other Leonardo hotel in La Ramblas. Only one lift but we didn't have a problem with waiting. Convenient location to walk to Sangrada Familia (10 minutes walk away) and the metro station Clot (5minutes away). Free Wifi which is good for the most part but did cut out at times. Two sun terraces with spectacular views across the city. Supermarket right next door. Would stay again. ","August 15, 2017","8    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

482,"Good hotel for a short stay in Barce. We had an issue checking in, we paid upfront for the room when we booked so the room was already paid for. When we checked in the 2 slightly rude girls on the desk said we needed the card we used to pay for security reasons to prove who we were despite having other cards in the same name & our passports this wasn't good enough for them. They said we couldn't check in without it so we had to leave our bags with them while we went into the city & waited for a relative back home to take a photo of the card and send it to us. This meant we couldn't use our room to freshen up after a long day of traveling. This was sorted later that day but some basic common sense from the hotel staff would have fixed this. Very stupid.Location is a little way outside of the city but good public transport links solve this problem. We got the train from the airport to Clot main-line station which is only a 5 min walk away. Also Clot has a metro stop with an entrance just meters from the hotel.The rooms are basic but nice for what you pay. Shops in the area for food and drink if you need any in your room.

483,"Stayed 4 nights 2 rooms, positively surprised even after reading positive reviews on TA. Rooms were extremely clean, bathroom was great, service was good. Comfort rooms are smallish but okay, the Deluxe room (with Nespresso machine!) is great though and doesn't cost much more. Location is nice and cozy, and 2 minutes away is the Clot metro, at 1 EUR per ride anywhere in the city I would much rather stay in a quiet and affordable location. Sagrada Familia and the Glories Mall are easy walking distance, and there's also a bus we took to Parc Guell and the science museum. To the budget-conscious, you can get from the airport to El Clot Arrago railway station for 1 Euro using the R2 train and walk to the hotel, which we did on arrival and return. Wi-fi was super fast. The breakfast was okay when we tried it but most days we got some croissants and pastries from the several bakeries up Mallorca st.Had a couple of good dinners at the strangely-named ""Glow Bar"" a few steps from the hotel entrance.Would certainly stay here again on a next visit to lovely Barcelona.","July 19, 2017","8    Leonardo Boutique Hotel Barcelona Sagrada Familia

495,"This hotel had a very thorough check-in process. Just after booking, I received a few instruction and information emails, and even an option to book transportation direct from the airport. They also requested confirmation of arrival times and if any special needs were required, etc. I really appreciated this. A day or two before my arrival date, I again received a follow-up email confirming that nothing had changed.The staff here was just lovely and everyone was very helpful with the exception of one female staff member (maybe she was just having a bad week?) who we eventually just avoided asking for help at all, and that solved that! Our room was cleaned daily and we never had to request fresh towels or linens. For two travelers, there was ample space - keep in mind that the rooms all over Europe are often much smaller than what many are accustomed to. We never turned on the tv, but there was one in the room, along with a safe and a writing desk and chair. The beds were stiff but comfortable. My only complaint is that the walls were very thin and even thinner from the bathroom! In fact, we could hear our neighbors very clearly, when we stepped into the bathroom.The location is good for the price. You'll find you're about a 8-10 minute walk from both the Sagrada Familia and the Arc de Triomphe. For those that have purchased the double decker bus tickets or metro pass, you can find stations at both of these attractions. The major train station is only about a 6 minute walk away as well. To get to Casa Mila or Casa Batllo, it's about a 25 minute walk. Montjuic/ Magic Fountain, about 55 minutes. I took a walk to the bunkers one morning, and even at a pretty quick pace, it took me about 45 minutes. But this city is spread out and you'll need to expect to do some walking no matter what. Plus, you'll want to get in some extra activity after eating all of those tapas!For the frugal traveler who's always looking for a deal, like myself, this place was perfect. It was a decent location with good accommodations and enough space for 2 people comfortably. There are small markets just right across the street, for water, snacks & essentials. The ease of public transportation was also a big plus.","April 10, 2019","9    Hotel Acta Antibes

There's a 24h supermarket two doors down the street, and a metro station (Monumental) only 2 blocks away (less than 5 mins walk) which will take you downtown or up to La Sagrada Familia. The staff at the hotel were amazing (especially Eduardo) and the breakfast had plenty of choice and was regularly topped up. The room was small, but was clean & tidy. Unfortunately, the window of our room had no view at all (other than a brick wall and a fire exit), so very little light got into the room, but this wasn't of much concern as the room is only for sleeping in - not for sitting looking out the window all day. The beds were comfortable and clean, the aircon was good, there was a wardrobe and a safe. The bathroom was very very compact but had a sink, a bidet, a toilet, and a bath with a good shower in it.

Despite having a room at the front, overlooking the street, the double windows kept out the noise and my sleep wasn't disturbed by traffic at all. The only disturbance was from people using the lift, so I'd recommend requesting a room away from that area.The very best thing about Acta Antibes was the friendliness of the reception staff. Without exception, I found them extremely accommodating, welcoming, and helpful, with advice about using public transport, finding places to eat, and general information.The location is great! The closest metro station is only a very short walk away, and a local bus stop is also close for an alternate way to get around. It's in a walkable and safe area, which is very important to me, being an older solo traveller.Breakfast is nothing special, but it's more than adequate and a reasonable cost for Barcelona standards.Yes, it's only a 2 star hotel but it presents as well above that.

A 24 hour supermarket is around the corner of the hotel.We will consider staying here again should we come back to Barcelona in the future.","August 6, 2017","9    Hotel Acta Antibes

Better yet you walk in to some polite and friendly staff.Amazing location, just 2 min walk from metro station, 10 mins from Sagrada Familia and around 25 mins to La Rambla.We had booked this through booking.com and could cancel for free up until the day before and pay at the property. We didn't need to cancel. The staff couldn't do more for us. The room was clean, comfy and was quiet - couldn't hear much from outside. Great shower, clean bathroom and we had our room cleaned/made each day.Better yet, we had a safe in our room - which they didn't charge for!!!Thank you to all the team for a fab stay!!!","August 6, 2017","9    Hotel Acta Antibes

520,"I've visited during the MWC confrence but even taking that into account, chatging the price the hotel charged was shameful.Other than the nice location near the segrada familia and the truly pleasent staff, the hotel is not a reccomended experience.Rooms are tiny, built in a way that makes them extra uncomfortable, lacking in some basic elements you'd expact, not even a kettle.It looks, feels and is old, as if time froze in the early 80s, and breakfast tastes as if it was made then.Too bad - nice team and in hotel that leaves much to br desired.Eoukd only reccomend if the price was VERY low, and in MWC it was not.","July 8, 2017","9    Hotel Acta Antibes

We paid for a double bed and got 2 twins individually dressed with separate coverings shoved together. I paid about 200$ for a room that I wasn’t provided a complementary safe to use. After using the glasses for wine on the first night and leaving them stacked and clearly not clean they were put back side by side still dirty on the desk.Overall, it d a very nice hotel with terrible service. The housekeeping is lazy and pays no attention to any details (such as a previously used comb, absolutely disgusting).

It was a bonus for us as we travel quite a long way. Was able to have a quick shower before going to explore e city. Location was great, near almost all e places of interest. Room was of a good size for 2 of us..we asked for kettle from e reception and was also given it.. Minus point was e noise from our next door neighbours but of course that's not of e hotel's fault as e walls were thin. Overall very happy with e 4 nights stay. Thank you!

562,"I recently stayed at Hotel HCC Montblanc. This hotel was nicely appointed. My room and bathroom were spacious, bed was perfect. Excellent location -- very close to a Metro station. Walking distance (~2 blocks) to the Gothic Quarter. My only two unmet desired: ability to open window to see out of it and down the street (not just across to housing immediately outside my window), and there was no coffee maker so I had to go downstairs to breakfast just for a coffee. Would stay here again!","July 16, 2019","10    HCC Montblanc

600,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Pleasant location and conveniently located for the city centre and waterfront.As with most Motel One properties the lobby was huge and very stylish however be warned that most bedrooms are very small and seem quite cramped. If you can do without a view and an outdoor terrace (they charge a premium for these rooms), rooms ending in 45 are at the end of a corridor, quiet and offer much more space than most. Be aware though that they have a fairly narrow window which looks into a light well and are therefore not blessed with much natural light. The rooms are simply but smartly furnished, clean and comfortable with a decent walk-in shower.Breakfast was OK although not as nice as that served in some of the chain’s German & Austrian hotels.The rooftop terrace is very stylish and offers great views of the park and across to the old town. A real sun trap offering comfortable seating and bar service at certain (limited) times.A great budget choice for what can be a very expensive city when it comes to hotels.","September 4, 2019","11    Motel One Barcelona-Ciutadella

There are a lot of nearby restaurants to choose from also.They do not have a restaurant at this hotel however there is a very good breakfast buffet for 9£ from 7am - 11 am. The buffet has rolls and croissant, pastries, cheeses, bacon, fruit and hard boiled eggs. It’s very satisfying and I recommend getting it (they will offer at check in if you did’t choose your accommodation). There’s a very nice bar area, reception area and courtyard where you can relax.

Bathroom with shower is good and the products included are nice to use. The little touches such as complimentary water, glasses to drink from, tea/coffee in the room are sadly and noticeably missing. Corridors are noisy and busy!! You can hear everything! Breakfast was a let down, nothing cooked available and simple things such as cucumber, tomatoes and fruit were not fresh, looking unappealing if anything. Rooftop terrace is beautiful, quiet and the lady who runs the bar is friendly and helpful. However, you can only pay by cash which is a little annoying. Lobby area is cool with ample seating and has a nice design. Sadly, for over £100 a night, we felt we did not get value for money. Location is good, walking distance to the Gothic quarter.

609,"The Motel One is a good hotel located in a handy area and a 5 minute walk from Arc de Triomf metro and regional rail station. Only 1 stop by regional rail or 2 stops by metro from Placa Catalunya (top of La Rambla). Yes the rooms are small but what do you expect from a budget hotel chain? The hotel is also located across the road from Parc Catalunya which is great for an evening stroll. My only criticism is the breakfast is definetly not worth the €9.50pp, much better options for half the cost nearby. Not sure why people are complaining about the hotel being of a 3 star standard, that's because it is a 3 star hotel! ","July 15, 2019","11    Motel One Barcelona-Ciutadella

If only the rooms had been made a little larger and better equipped? this being the first hotel I've ever stayed in without a kettle - essential after a hard days slog around Barcelona. Very limited 'wardrobe' space meant we lived 1/2 out of our suitcase for the 5 nights we stayed. Opted NOT to pay 9.50 Euros each for breakfast and found cafes around the corner doing bacon sandwich and coffee for less. Some decent eating places for all times of the day nearby and it seems to be a popular area with locals. Opposite the park and close to both major bus routes and Metro (Arc de Triomf station), Easy walking into Gothic Barcelona (Las Ramblas and port area etc).

(Quiet, low floor, garden facing patio or street facing higher story). We chose the room over looking the inner garden. It was great. Super clean room with a lot of sunlight. Quiet also since it was facing an inner garden. The hotel sits on a rather busy road so we were really grateful for the quiet room. The room, although small, had great space allocation. The location was great - 10 minutes walk to anywhere you want to go. Close to El Born and the Gothic Quarter. And lastly, the staff made the biggest difference in going above and beyond for the clients. The only con I can think of is that there is no gym, but not a deal breaker in this case.

623,"I booked this hotel only because my friends stayed there.I have received exactly what I was expecting for the price paid.Hotel: the same as all other Motel One hotels (this is a concept, I heard). Huge lobby bar serves breakfasts and some food during the day. It is advertised as open 24 hours a day, but don't expect to buy some alcohol (including beer) at night. One night they stopped selling it at 2.00, the next night - even at 1.00. Both times I was late to grab a glass of wine before bed.Rooftop terrace closes at 7 PM, so don't expect it to be available to you every time you wish to enjoy the views.Rooms: yes, they are tiny and basic. No wardrobe (just a couple of pretty high shelves), no work table, no telephone (but would you even call reception, if there is no room service at the hotel?), no amenities in the bathroom (except soap and all-in-1 washing liquid). Everything in the room tells you, that you chose to save money for your holiday stay instead of enjoying the trip to the full.Plus points: good location next to El Born, very decent WIFI, cleanliness.Verdict: this is the place to sleep, nothing else.","April 12, 2019","11    Motel One Barcelona-Ciutadella

Really, one can stay here as a single traveler, or intimate couple with backpacks, but not us, not a couple with a infant daughter and three suitcases.. we physically could not fit in the space. The advertised king sized bed is a misunderstanding.. for the motel, king size means two doubles pushed together. Less than a queen size in canada. the staff was friendly and refunded our subsequent prepaid nights after a single very difficult night. If you put everything on the bed, two people can stand in the room. When you sleep, you put everything on the floor, but then you can't stand or even walk to the bathroom.","April 10, 2019","11    Motel One Barcelona-Ciutadella

I'm glad I did: Motel One consistently had clean, comfortable, functional, and well designed rooms. The Barcelona location is no exception to this rule. My room was not large, but it was comfortable with everything that I needed: a comfortable bed, some hangers to hang clothing, and a safe for my valuables. The only issue was in the bathroom where the design of the shower stall means that water splashes out onto the floor of the bathroom in general.The ground floor bar is comfortable and busy, with reasonably priced drinks. The rooftop lounge area has a great view over the city (although it closes rather early at 7pm). I do skip breakfast, so I cannot speak it its price/value aspects.

644,"Stayed 3 nights in this hotel with my husband and another couple. Our flight arrived very early so the hotel took our luggage so we could go explore the city while waiting on our room. We got a room on the ground floor beside the bar and terrace, the bedroom was very big and a huge bathroom and terrace. The room was spotless and cleaned everyday. The bar itself is very modern and staff very friendly. The negatives about the bar were; 1. Understaffed - most of the time only one person on the bar serving drinks and food I felt sorry for the staff they were literally running in the bar dropping food at tables then back behind the bar to serve a crowd of people 2. They ran out of most beers we had to change our order 4 separate times as they ran out of everything and they didn’t seem to stock up as they still didn’t have the beer back in the following day 3. Ordered toasted sandwiches and they weren’t great at all. There is a roof top terrace which is gorgeous but if heading up there order your drink at the bar downstairs and bring up with you as there was no bar upstairs there is a number to ring if you want drinks brought up but we couldn’t find a phone to actually ring. The location of the hotel is excellent, walking distance to everything. The hotel is great value for an excellent location. Overall we had a great stay in Barcelona and I would recommend this hotel for location. ","November 6, 2018","11    Motel One Barcelona-Ciutadella

Close to Park Ciutadella, Arc de Triumph, train stop, and walking distance to the Gothic Quarter. My husband and I also enjoyed our morning walk to to Sagrada Familia. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was a little small, but we were out so much we didn't mind. Room and bathrooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. We couldn't have asked for more.

The hotel is beautifully designed, clean and located within easy walking distance of most of the sights and culture that the city has to offer, including Arc de Triomf and Parc de la Ciutadella just on the doorstep. Our room was a little on the small side but ideal for our needs. The bathroom was generously sized and featured a fantastic power-shower.

648,"We visited this hotel on Monday 16th September. We had done a fair bit of research to find a quiet hotel that was well reviewed by other people. this place is in a side street but within walking distance of the Rambla and all the main sightseeing areas.Lovely! From check in we realised it was going to be a very relaxing stay. We paid a little more to have a room with a balcony. But what an amazing view of mountains in the distance and just a canopy of trees on either side from the top of the balcony.The room was huge with very comfortable beds and a little sitting room. A fantastic rain shower which was very welcome, after hours of walking around.We even had a fantastic recommendation for an evening meal. The best steak we have ever eaten.So thank you so much to the lovely staff of Hotel Constanza. If we ever return we would come back to you. No question.Barcelona has to be the most beautiful city in Europe. Every building is so beautiful. It is also so clean. It appears that even the pavements get showered at night.What a great time. What a lovely hotel.","September 23, 2019","12    Hotel Constanza Barcelona

650,"Hotel Constanza was in a quiet street in a great location close to all sites. The Reception staff were friendly, attentive and gave helpful advice. The rooftop bar was a nice spot to unwind and have a meal and drink which I did on my last night and the food was very tasty. Unfortunately I was disappointed in the breakfast dishes that were on offer. The eggs and baked beans were cold and the selection of fruit was poor with over ripened bananas. Also I would have liked fresh coffee instead of out of a machine. The room was clean with good air conditioning but there was a lot of noise from adjoining rooms on my floor well into midnight both from children and adults. Also I could hear the plumbing from the room next door so I had a few sleepless and disturbed nights. There are many nice cafes nearby for breakfast so if I stayed again I would not include breakfast at the hotel unless it was improved but on the whole I would recommend this hotel with it's nice entrance and waiting lounge area, attentive reception staff and perhaps a rule should be in place for late night noise so guests can enjoy their nights in a comfortable and well placed hotel in a safe area","August 6, 2019","12    Hotel Constanza Barcelona

655,"Stayed here Tue 2nd - Sat 6th July. Easy to find the hotel and its nice and central. Staff on the reception desk spoke good, clear English and were very helpful. Especially the chap who helped us with our transport back to the hotel (wish i'd gotten his name). Room itself was basic but clean, all you need for a short city break in my eyes. Double bed was a bit hard. TV has no english channels (that may bother some people). We were in 301 and had a balcony which was good for sunbathing! Mini bar was expensive so don't bother use that.The rooftop bar was a bit naff, some chairs and a small bar, but nothing decent. Nicer ones near by. Overall really good stay here and would consider coming back, however... the walls are a tad thin. We could here the people above and next to us walking around/closing doors when we were trying to sleep (11pm ish). We let it go but on our last night the room next door were blaring music at 12pm. We had to get up at 4am for our flight home. I went on banged on the door, three times!!!! as they couldn't hear me over the music, and told them to turn it off. To which they did, but we could still hear them talking and showering. I appreciate the hotel can't walk up and down the corridors policing, but they should have better noise control and rules in place for no loud music after 10.30pm. They should enforce this better. Didn't have time to speak to anyone in the hotel as we were leaving so early as I mentioned. We paid £508.77 for 4 nights, which was cheap compared to other places.","July 15, 2019","12    Hotel Constanza Barcelona

I generally stay in Marriott / Starwoods properties since I have elite status in their loyalty program. My friends had previously stayed at the Constanza and suggested that we stay there. This small extremely well located hotel exceeded my expectations at every turn. Friendly and helpful staff, large rooms with ample amenities including a safe, refrigerator and excellent shower as well as a balcony were more than I expected from a two star hotel. The hotel is subject to the restrictive rating system in the EU but the elements that would give it a higher rating did not in any way detract from a most enjoyable stay. We walked everywhere in the central area to restaurants, museums, and shopping with ease. A delightful tapas restaurant is attached and provides breakfast for hotel guests.

Tea/coffee facilities would have been cherry on top of the cake. Good aircon.Lovely staff throughout. Great rooftop bar. Plenty of sockets in the places you need them. Had breakfast. Somewhat steep for 10 euro pp - but addition of better yogurt, some fresh fruit salad, musli, higher quality cereals, bacon would rectify this. Spain/Catalunya not renowned for their breakfasts - but there are decent cafes about! Cons. Soundproofing may be an issue - if you wanted a lie in - thankfully our neighbours were quiet on the whole and we were up early. No external noise.Flaccid is the best way to describe the pillows.

Bedding and linen is premium, there is a safe in the room, and the bathrooms are honestly humongous. Great shower... Rainfall style.The staff though is what makes this place special and deserving of a higher than 2* classification. House keeping was tip top, and the front desk extremely friendly and helpful. Every one is multi lingual so that's an incredible advantage. My only beef is the early check out at 11 am. I did get a 30 minute extension, which I am grateful for.

The room was on the smaller side as was the bathroom. Overall, the hotel was nice. Staff was great, very accommodating and extremely helpful. One thing though, if you are looking for quite, do not get the room with the balcony over the road. As lovely as it was, the street was noisy.","June 21, 2018","12    Hotel Constanza Barcelona

691,"We had the pleasure of staying here for eight days - one of the best stays in all our travels. The hotel is in a lovely quiet area, and you're only a ten minute walk from the heart of the city - Placa Catalunya, La Rambla, the Gothic Quarter, dining, and lots of shopping are right there. The Arc de Triomf is only a few minutes away, and you can wander down to walk to the gardens and zoo from there. And the Casa Battlo is also within walking distance.There are metro stops very close by as well. Near the hotel there are some great places to eat - we went up the street to the corner bistro, Bar el Buscatrufas, for breakfast each morning, so we can't offer anything on the hotel breakfast, and right around the corner is a lovely place, El Mercate, with great tapas. The restaurant right beside the hotel is also really good. There are lots of little markets for picking up extras like snacks and wine in the area, and ATMs. We had the superior double room with a terrace and sitting area, and it was fabulous. The terrace faced out into the central back area, and was a lovely place to enjoy our morning coffee (we brought our own fixings), and a glass of wine after a long day of wandering. We didn't have the 'luxe' brown bedding scheme, we had the blue, and it was really quite lovely. The room was spacious and comfortable, the bed really comfortable. The housekeeping is outstanding - our room was spotless every day. The bathroom was spacious and water pressure excellent for the rain shower, which also had consistent temperature - very appreciated. The staff all speak English very well and were super helpful and friendly every time we had a question - they also greeted us every time we came into the lobby - really attentive. A note - they do provide shampoo and a shower gel, but no other 'extras' - we always bring our own anyway, but just to be aware. We were really impressed and loved it here. On our next trip to Barcelona, this will be the place, no question. Better than a three-star for sure. I'm not including pics just because there are so many out there, and truly, they are true to the experience. It's great. Thank you Hotel Constanza and all your staff for an awesome stay!","June 13, 2018","12    Hotel Constanza Barcelona

692,"Overall this hotel was very nice. The check in was quick and efficient, the staff was friendly, and the room was clean and comfortable. Great location and easy city to walk around in. There's several nice restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk.We live in an urban loft back at home so the sounds of the city don't bother us. However, this hotel is full of hard surfaces including the floors in all the halls and stairways (nothing to absorb sounds). We could hear voices, footsteps, doors opening, and any little thing that dropped in the neighboring rooms echoed through the hotel. If you're a light sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs.For the ladies with a lot of hair, the hair dryer in our room had to be ""held down"" while using it. This wasn't a big deal for me but if you have thick hair your hand might get sore after a few minutes of that.If you need to park a car I would suggest contacting the hotel in advance. I read that there was self parking available but they only have 3 spots. We got lucky to have a spot for the few days we were there!","June 7, 2018","12    Hotel Constanza Barcelona

At 8.40 that evening I received a threatening complaint from booking.com on behalf of the hotel quote I was not complying with hotel policy and police would be called with charge” in connection to the noise earlier that day. May I also add I resided in room I was allocated on check in 103 on no occasion did hotel staff contact or speak to me prior to receiving this email? The c cleaner may not understand the language of guests but a tip - a smile is universal and would serve this hotel well. Towels changed daily and rooms spotless.

The hotel is in a good location and is clean however, most of the staff were not friendly to say the least, in particular the maid and reception stafff. One time we made noise because we all congregated in one room and we were cautioned with police action which is EXTREMELY harsh (note there is no bar area and you are also not allowed food or drink on the rooftop so extremely limited for a communal place). On our last day we were out sightseeing then came back to the hotel (had a late return flight) and we sat up on the rooftop only to be told by the hotel staff that as we were not physically staying over night at the hotel we are not considered “guests” anymore.

There was no kettle, no coffee , tea facilities. It would be good to make a cup of tea in the evening after walking all day. One good think was hotel's location.

718,"This was our second time at the Onix Rambla Hotel. It's now our go-to hotel when we want a comfortable place to sleep after the opera to which we can walk in about 15 minutes down the Rambla. The staff is extremely pleasant. Winter prices are unbelievably inexpensive. We paid under 60 euros including breakfast! The room was good-sized, with very comfortable beds. It's wonderful to stay in a budget hotel which isn't trying to save money by not giving a top sheet and forcing one to sleep under an often-way-too-heavy duvet. The bed was made up the way I like it: bottom sheet, top sheet, blanket, and spread. The bathroom was perfect, with excellent hot water and water pressure. Breakfast was a rather decent varied buffet served in a good-sized dining room. In our reservation request, we had asked for a room with a king-size bed, not on the Rambla. When we arrived, we were smilingly told that we had been given an ""upgrade"" to a twin-bedded room with Rambla ""view"". We said that we were OK with the twin beds, but that we didn't want the Rambla view, because the Rambla view (which is not a view) means Rambla noise. The receptionist told us that we could have a room at the back, but that it was one of the darkest rooms. We asked to see both rooms, for which she graciously accommodated us, even though she was at the front desk on her own. Anyhow, in the end we took the ""upgrade"", because the interior room was really depressing. (On our first time at this hotel, we also had an interior room, which was much larger and had a real window.) Because it was winter, the noise on the Rambla was less of an issue, but it was a presence. Had it been any other time of year, I can't imagine what the noise in that room would have been like, even with the windows closed. Even though I've spent much time on this issue here, it really was minor compared to our overall very positive experience at the Onix Rambla, and we will return.","February 1, 2018","13    Onix Rambla Hotel

However, the main problem was that the room had no air conditioning, and it did get fairy warm at night. The hotel did loan us a fan which did help. Breakfast was included in our room rate, whilst not A1, it was adequate with more than enough choices. The lady at the reception was very helpful, explained where to visit, and was kind enough to loan us an electric kettle to make tea.Would stay at this hotel again.","June 8, 2017","13    Onix Rambla Hotel

728,Stayed here for 3 nights and never once did I feel hospitality from the people at the front desk (if there was even someone there). In fact staff was on the verge of being downright rude. On the day of checkout we left quite early in the morning (around 4am) so the front door was locked and two of us were there wanting to get out and get a taxi but he would't unlock the door until the third person signed for the additional room charges. Did he think we were going to run out on the bill or something? Had to ask for more bath soap and shampoo because housekeeping didn't refresh them after cleaning. Just overall a bad stay and would not stay here again.,"March 22, 2017","13    Onix Rambla Hotel

The only downside was we asked a nice receptionist if she would kindly ring up to see what time our taxi would be coming, and her Manager, arrived on the scene, and was talking about us to her in Spanish, The Front of House Manager was very rude to us and said they didn't do things like that, we had a phone in our bedroom. We only asked because of the language barrier, I felt sorry for the new girl who was very embarrassed about it.

The only down side is that you don't have any view from the hotel window and the room gets pretty hot after having showers as there is only one window in the bedroom. i would definitely recommend this hotel for a city break !!

Breakfast was free and was great. The Front of House team were ever so helpful, friendly and professional. The location was a few minutes walk to the Metro. My tip is to walk out of the hotel and turn right. Walk down for about 25 minutes where you will get to the beach. Nice walk along the promenade as well as a plethora of eateries.","April 9, 2019","14    Hotel Sant Antoni

I just needed a bed to sleep on. I appreciate that the bathroom was a standard size vs those tiny bathrooms at other european hotels. My stay included breakfast, which had a variety of options. The staff too was very nice and friendly. The only negatives: my room view was indoor (but I wasn't in the room much so didn't care) and there weren't any electrical outlets near the bed.

785,"This is really a very, very good deal if one of your main 'must see' places is the Sagrada Familia cathedral. The price we paid for a day's stay is just the equivalent of the taxi ride from the airport to the hotel (there was heavy traffic & the ride took an hour ++). In Barcelona, taxi rides are almost the same or even cheaper than ride-sharing schemes like Cabify or Uber. The Airport/local bus & local MRT are cheap but you have to drag your baggage around while looking for those small street signs & house numbers.This small but well-lit -with a signage- hotel is nestled in a corner & the Sagrada cathedral is just a 10-15 minute walk. As soon as you step out of the hotel door, just head north (don't turn left (west) nor right (east) --just cross the street & head north) & make sure you cross the wide Avinguda Diagonal (Diagonal Avenue in English) & you're almost there. If you're a fast walker, you can do SF in 10 minutes!But what makes this hotel such a bargain was the breakfast that would cost you easily a lot of Euros outside. They have literally everything you could ask for to nourish you for an entire day: a big, fast coffee machine, fruits, cereals, a good sampling of cold cuts (no Jamon Iberico, though), fruits, olives, cheeses, scrambled/boiled eggs & more plus, yes -- good Spanish sardines!!! Where you eat breakfast doubles up as a cafe later in the day.The rooms are rather small with very narrow hallways but clean and decent but the shower stall have very good water pressure. As typical in a small European hotel, a 'double bed' consisted of 2 narrow beds pushed together. Since you'll stay more time outside, I'm not complaining. We had paid much higher prices in other places with no breakfast at that.The room we had was at the back & had a view of life's reality in a big tourist-centric city where apartments/condos were converted into small hotels/hostels to make money. If you happen to have a room in the front, there's really nothing much to see except the narrow street action below.Would I recommend it or, shall I stay here again?? Again, if you plan to visit Sagrada Familia & would like a very, very leisurely walk going there, this is your place. Take a taxi if plan to go the La Boqueria/Plaza Catalunya/Las Ramblas & all that madness in Barcelona.","December 25, 2018","14    Hotel Sant Antoni

Breakfast was plentiful with all the usual fruits, cereals, pastries, cold meats etc, the only downside was the coffee (auto machine) and orange not exactly the best (orange was that powder stuff) but hey, it's 3 star not 5 and you get what you pay for. Hotel was extremely clean, bed soooo comfy (think mattress was memory foam) and very quiet which, after a day of treading the pavements of Barcelona was a blessing. Staff were helpful and always friendly. Nearest metro is Monument (L2 purple line), but please be aware, pickpockets tried to get into my husbands rucksack on the escalator, there was 3 of them, 2 men and 1 woman, who stopped the escalator (i guess to distract and confuse) and on walking up they opened his rucksack, thankfully didn't take anything as he felt something, turned round and foiled them. Please be really careful and take precautions.

810,We stayed at this amazing hotel for one night pre-cruise. It is situated in a great area with lots of shopping and easy access to other nearby sights. We took advantage of the warm summer evening and had some snacks and drinks up on the rooftop which has a great view. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean. The bathroom was also very nice with a great shower. We were given complimentary bottled water in our room. We asked for a quiet room and weren’t disappointed. There were double doors in our room that opened and overlooked a small patio space for the apartments around the hotel. It didn’t bother us at all and added to the charm. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. We asked to leave our luggage while we killed some time in the Gothic Quarter before leaving for our cruise the next morning and the staff were very accommodating. They were also very helpful with suggestions about where to shop and eat. Tickets are also sold at the front desk for the Sagrada Familia cathedral if you’re looking for some although you can only purchase them once you are at the hotel.

On arrival we were made very welcome as we were every time we passed reception, I honestly cannot remember the last time I experienced this in a hotel! With a smile and a hello. It’s a great location near the stunning gothic quarter, our balcony had a view of the cathedral. We walked to the marina, Ramblas and found taxis cheap when we went a little further. The breakfast is excellent and a great start to the day too. Highly recommend this hotel and hope to return again. ","September 10, 2019","15    H10 Madison

830,"All the great reviews I read about this hotel are not just hype. It is one of the best hotels my family and I have ever stayed in (2 rooms for 3 nights), and we are very picky. First, the reception staff who, to a person, were welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable. Special thanks go to Pedro and a young woman with a light brown ponytail whose name started with N (sorry I didn't get her full name). They were patient with endless questions, funny, offered great suggestions for sightseeing and dining, and were just plain delightful. The standard room was a good size, clean, and had the most comfortable bed I've ever had in a hotel. The H10 Madison's location is perfect, literally down the block from the Cathedral and the concert hall, walking distance to many of the major attractions, and a two-block walk to the metro that takes you to virtually every other one. In mid-afternoon, after a full round of sightseeing, the rooftop bar and pool area is a welcome respite with a great view. While only a plunge pool, it is refreshing, the atmosphere is relaxing, bar service is prompt and friendly, and we never had a problem finding clean towels. Prior to this trip, we had never heard of the H10 brand, but given the experience the Madison offered us, I will always look for H10 first in my future travels. Thank you for a great start to a wonderful trip.","August 27, 2019","15    H10 Madison

I'm a very light sleeper and we were on the 6th floor- I was worried noise would travel from above but it did not. It was super quiet. If you are sensitive to noise I recommend the interior rooms, as the main street would be pretty noisy to face. This hotel worked to delight us and the staff were really nice, all of them-- thank you Pedro as check in, but really everyone. Hardworking and attentive. The rooftop is really nice to go up to-- great views but also quiet and peaceful, even when crowded, at least for us. Wait staff on the roof also super nice and hardworking. Location is fantastic. I was worried about staying in a hotel chain I was unfamiliar with, but they were great and I'd definitely stay with them again here or at another one.

832,"The location is very central and has a great view and access to Cathedral Square. The staff for check-in were very nice and helpful. However, after check-in, only one time the rest of our entire stay ever say hello or welcome back when we came into the hotel. The housekeeping staff on the other hand were extremely friendly and always said good morning and asked if everything was ok. The rooms are really wonderful - great size and amenties. Comfy beds, large bathrooms (esp by European standards), bottled water and coffee. Ceiling fans are a really nice touch and helps with keeping AC down. We had a room with a small balcony which was great so you could sit and listen to the city. If you lean out you can see the cathedral. The rooftop pool is one of the main reasons we booked this hotel. The view is amazing and the setting is beautiful and modern. The pool area does seems a little neglected as far as attention as there was only one time we went when they weren't out of towels.. Additionally, know that the bar/cafe is NYC priced which is not unexpected but the service there was extremely hit or miss. I sat by the pool for and hour and 45 minutes one afternoon while my son was swimming and no one ever approached to see if I needed anything, and our last night when it was raining a little so it was very empty the waitress would look our way and turn around. We finally went to the bar where everyone was just standing talking and asked if we could get drinks. Also, the day we got food, the waiter kept bringing us chips even after we asked not to which would normally be great but not when they are charging 2 euros a pop - so watch for that. The breakfast at the hotel is ridiculously expensive but right across the street are no less than three cafes where you can get breakfast and coffee for significantly less money. Cafe 365 and Cappuccino were our favorites - we could breakfast for 4 for the cost of breakfast for 1 at the hotel.I would still fully recommend this hotel as even with these bumps, it was an extremely postive experience.","August 23, 2019","15    H10 Madison

Front desk staff very helpful and accommodating for my partner who had to do a job interview remotely at 12 am. They found him a space in the lobby and turned off the overhead music for him. Excellent customer service! We stayed 3 nights and I could have spent a week here. Room was cleanBeds are very comfortable and we always slept too late because the blackout curtains and sound-proofing work really well! The air conditioning worked well too. We had a “family room”, which was a queen size bed and full size sofa bed. Both are very comfortable. Bathroom was also clean with plenty of towels and soft robes. My only critical comment about the room is that there were not enough hooks to hang towels, the hand held shower wand wouldn’t turn on, and the seal at the bottom of the shower wasn’t tight and let water leak out to the floor. I didn’t tell the hotel about these things as they seemed really minor. The rooftop bar is good sized with friendly waitstaff. The plunge pool is relatively small but perfect for a plunge. There is plenty of seating with both tables and lounge chairs. There is a complimentary drink if you are a member of their “club”. Food seemed a little overpriced for what us was and there are lots of places to eat nearby so we didn’t eat there. The cathedral and gothic quarter are less than a block away.

When we were going for the water in the lobby area, she asked if we wanted champagne instead which we delightfully agreed.

We loved the room with the big showers, comfy bed, and the roof with drinks and a pool. Everyone who works there is incredibly kind.

858,"Brilliant location, near metro which is super easy to use. We got a 3 day HOLA card which allows you to use on bus & metro & the metro even takes you to the airport so you’re all set for 18 euros each. Bargain. Citymapper helped lots, could use on our EE normal data package. The hotel was comfortable, so clean, little luxury details from bathroom range to treats by lobby. Service was always friendly they held our luggage after checkout as we had time to explore before return flight. As it was over Valentines Day we came back to a champagne bottle & chocolates on day 2. So sweet. Rooftop terrace has pool & views of city with a bar! Beds are so comfortable, balcony a bonus with city views. I would defo return! Got this on a deal via booking.com otherwise h10s can be pricey!We went to so many delicious food spots there is so much choice! From Paella, Tapas to Brunch & Churros! Bakeries are yum!Best bakery near beach: baluardBest brunches: MILK in Gothic Quarter & MARMALADE in Raval great decor food coffee & live djWe had tapas from La Pepita & its a tiny spot gotta squeeze in.

860,"My husband, our 2 boys age 9 and 12, and I stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise out of Barcelona. This hotel was perfect. It’s more of a boutique hotel and very modern. Didn’t feel like a chain. Perfect location. You can walk to a bunch of sights and just wander around the Gothic Quarter and La Rambla during the day and night. We hailed a taxi right in front of the hotel to take us to Sagrada Família (book your tickets online). The front desk staff helped us book tickets to the FCA Barca Camp Nau (which my son wanted to see) and they also helped us get a taxi to the cruise port, and booked our hotel transfer from the airport. The staff spoke English which was helpful. We stayed in a suite, which worked for us. I emailed the hotel ahead of time and they helped me book it. Our view was of an alley and residential balconies, seemed pretty quiet. Surprisingly, however, at 11:45 pm on Friday night a local neighbor set of fireworks off the rooftop right next to our room window. Kind of interesting/cool/festive. It was LGTBQ pride parade weekend so maybe it was just celebratory fireworks, not sure if it’s the norm. My son went in the rooftop pool while husband and I had a drink up there. They provide bathrobes in the rooms, which my son wore up to the roof, so the experience had a spa-like feel. Pool is small but a good place to rest and relax for about an hour or so. Awesome photo opp of the cathedral. My only complaint is the rooftop drink/food service was awkwardly slow. Breakfast was excellent, and the food service was top notch. Complimentary water and espresso machine in the room was nice, too. it was really a great way to start our vacation. I wish we had stayed there in Barcelona a couple more nights.

The hotel is very clean and modern with plenty of free bottled water and amenities. The buffet breakfast is wonderful. Loved the creeps, gluten free bread and desserts. Folks complained about the elevator and frankly it was no problem at all! We enjoyed taking the trains to the near by town of Sitges which had a great beach. Overall a great trip at a great location.

Only negative I have is you must be allowed to smoke in the room as there is an ashtray and the pillows literally stank of old smoke. Not pleasant for a non smoker and a child.

From the moment we arrived we were created by a lovely receptionist, we had arrived early from airport as we took the RENFE train which brought us straight to El Clot-Arago station and took 30 minutes and hotel only 5 mins away, so we were only planning on dropping off bags but luckily our room was early so we had a chance to change. The location of hotel is perfect for the metro and from the terrace floor 8 you can Sagrada Familia. We mainly used hotel as a base. We did get the bus number 92 from up the street to Park Guell only took 30 mins and saved 20 minute walk up hill from tube. The room was lovely and clean and the beds comfortable the bathroom a little small the bath/shower is very close to toilet. The is a fridge in room which was very useful, unfortunately no kettle in room, but a coffee machine in reception and coffee available with breakfast which we didn't book, there was also of the offer of afternoon tea which was free but we never made it to try it.The hotel was very quiet other then the fire alarm going off at 6am because of one selfish person smoking in their room!And the guests that let there doors slam shut! Not hotels thought just selfish people. The pool although small which we knew before arriving was perfect after a hot day, and often quiet empty of other guests. And a another selfish person had a shower after swim then went straight to lift without towelling off first so a lovely slippery hazard.Food wise they have a varied room service list that they can order in for you. Also some local supermarkets that are great for picking up some cold beers or wine at reasonable prices. So on closing I would highly recommend this hotel all the staff are so friendly.

Heritage buildings are the most impressive point of interests for us on top of the beautiful setting of Laberint and Park of Guella. But the most remarkable for us is our stay at Catalonia Albeniz. The bedroom and bathroom are superb, clean and cozy. Linens are fresh. Nice ambience on the breakfast restaurant although with limited selection of buffet table. We love it. the most unforgotable is the friendliness of the staff especially Vako in the Front Office who checked us in and helped us with all information on the city sightseeing, tours and dining including his recommendation to visit Park Guella and Nou Camp Studium for my kids. Vako made our stay full of comfort and enjoyable. As a hotelier myself I know Vako deserves to be highlighted. He is not only super friendly, genuine and charming but also very helpful to guests especially us as the first visitor to the country and from Indonesia. He always try to upsell the hotel product and services. If I ever come back to Barcelona again in the future, Albeniz will be where I am going to stay.

Clot Metro station is a 5 minute walk away which gives you a 10 minute tube ride direct to Place we la Catalunya and Las Ramblas (recommend buying a T10 travel card which you can share with more than one traveller and get 10 trips). Rooms are comfortable, similar to a Holiday Inn Express but no tea/coffee making facilities in them...free coffee available in reception. Small swimming pool on roof, didn't use it but it looked nice for a cooling dip...too small for a good swim. No bar but I'd recommend the AK bar opposite if you want a quick drink to finish off your evening. Overall we were pleased with our stay.","June 13, 2018","16    Catalonia Albeniz

Our room at the back of the hotel which faces a courtyard was very quiet. However there is a gap between the frosted glass bathroom door and the door frame (which can be easily fixed) which allows sound and smell into the bedroom.The main reason we chose this hotel is its proximity to the metro and train (for the airport) station. The nearest metro entrance /exit is Carrer Arago Exit (steps) 160 m away while the Carrer Sibelius Exit (elevator) is 280 m from hotel.

935,I recently stayed at Smart Room for 1 week for my birthday and first trip to Barcelona and Spain. I originally felt very safe and happy with my choice though I will admit I was concerned with no safety box. My last day I had gone to check out and the front desk manager offers me a a great deal to stay in same room. I had planned one more day in Barcelona and was happy. I left the no service clearly marked * I have photos and evidence of everything> Came back to a made bed and my back pack clearly had been gone through. I had 420 US dollars + Ray Bans that were a gift for my birthday and a gift of a nice necklace for someone else. All 3 were inside a zipped pouch inside my toiletries bag inside my backpack. All of which was gone up my return. I immediately alerted the staff and was told to wait until morning. My fault for not immediately calling the police but I am a tourist I did not know procedure. The next day I was reassured by management the situation would be solved and solution I was happy with. I was forced to spend 3 hours on a Friday afternoon the day I was supposed to leave filing a police report. 11 days later the hotel emails me to say nothing will be done. I am currently filing a claim with Tourism office and pursuing Legal action. The hotel staff is conspiring with the house keeping letting them know detailed information of when guests leave and keeping them up to date if they come back.

937,"We chose budget over location during our Barcelona stay, and while there are a few drawbacks with this hotel, we were glad with our decision. Very reasonably priced, SmartRoom Barcelona is located in a quiet residential area outside the main tourist zone. You'll definitely need a metro card if you stay here, or it will be a good 40 minute walk to La Rambla. The hotel is just a few minutes' walk from the Placa de Sants metro station (Olzinelles is the street with the Sants Beer restaurant on the corner). The service at the front desk was amazing. The clerk was friendly and immediately set us up with a map, and took his time to recommend transit options and places to go. There is a lounge with vending machines and charging stations, plus coin lockers for luggage if you arrive early or have a later flight. We also liked the secure and reliable WiFi. Our room was sparse, but impeccably clean, and came with a guide outlining the neighbourhood and businesses the guests would find reliable. But there were challenges. There was room in the closet for one suitcase, but no luggage rack for our second suitcase, which I like to keep up off the floor. While the bed linens were crisp, the bed itself was extremely uncomfortable. I don't mind a firm mattress, but this was like sleeping on concrete. My back problems were exacerbated by the bathroom, in which there was no shelf in the shower for my shampoo, soap or face wash. I had to keep the containers on the floor, and crouching down to get them was painful after peeling myself off that mattress. I wondered if anyone had actually tested these rooms and had identified this as a problem. A breakfast buffet was on offer at the hotel for €8, or €7 if you reserved the previous day. Being conscious of budget, we skipped the buffet, not even checking it out so I could report back for this review. There are numerous grocery stores and bakeries on the same street as the hotel, and we found a pizza place just off La Rambla that became a go-to for its huge, €2.50 slices. (Side note: It's called Pasta Madre, and I literally sniffed it out around the corner from Amorino's. Such good pizza and friendly service, and sooooo cheap.) Despite the lack of shelving in the shower and the hard-as-a-rock mattress, we still enjoyed our stay at SmartRoom Barcelona, finding it great value for the price.","September 26, 2017","17    SmartRoom Barcelona

938,"When my girlfriend told me she'd booked a 2 star hotel for our Stay in Barcelona after our airbnb was cancelled at the last minute, I steeled myself for absolute mediocrity at best. What followed, however, could not be further from mediocre.Situated in the quiet sants neighbourhood, an easy walk from placa de sants metro, sants rail station and also the number 46 bus for the airport this hotel was the perfect base for our explorations.The room was clean and had everything we needed, there were handy lockers to leave our luggage when we arrived. We started each day with a delightful and filling buffet breakfast at €7 per person which represented great value!A special mention has to go to the receptionists (particularly the guy with the beard and glasses - sorry didn't catch our name!) who really went out of their way to ensure our stay was comfortable, giving assistance and recommendations!Top class 100% recommended!","September 13, 2017","17    SmartRoom Barcelona

939,"During research for a trip to Barcelona, finding a decent hotel in an accessible location and at a good value price was proving fairly difficult. That was until we found SmartRoom. This is a great little hotel. The rooms are very clean, simple and functional. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is located a short walking distance to the Metro, perfect to hop onto to see all of the sights in Barcelona. We had the buffet continental style breakfast every morning, which proved very filling. It was well priced and good quality food. If we were nitpicking about our stay, we would say that the pillows could've be a bit more substantial to improve comfort, but this did not impact the overall stay. In summary, we would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Barcelona.","September 9, 2017","17    SmartRoom Barcelona

942,"We stayed here for 6 nights and couldn't speak more highly of Smartroom Barcelona.It's very easy to get to from the airport. We took the Renfe train to Sants Estacio and then walked (it was a slow 15-20 minute walk). As you leave the station, through the main doors, walk straight down the road. You will come to a big junction and will see Sants Beer (which, incidentally, is a lovely tapas bar!) on the opposite side of the street. Cross over here and continue straight down this road; the hotel is about a 10 minute walk from here. The train journey is €4.10 and is not included in your T10 card. Cabs were around €30.We stayed on the sixth floor and our room had a small terrace, which was perfect to chill out on after a long day in the city! It was a little bit more but definitely worth paying the extra, in our opinion!Upon arrival, we were greeted by super friendly staff who gave us advice and recommendations to help us make the most of the city. Every single member of staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spotlessly and remained so throughout our stay as the rooms are cleaned daily; towels are replaced and bedsheets are made. The wifi worked pretty well and the vending machines are reasonably priced.We didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that! However, there was a lovely cafe about 5 minutes from the hotel called Panet, which sells beautifully pastries and baguettes. The supermarket across the road, Dia%, is very reasonably priced and the cheapest we found for water and beer.The metro line is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel; it's very easy to get into central Barcelona and it was lovely to leave the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas behind each evening! We would highly recommend staying here- it's a 2 star hotel so there aren't any 'frills' but the cleanliness, location and friendliness of staff more than make up for it!

I was shocked when I opened the door and saw a room that only fitted the bed, I felt like I was in a cage, window opened to the wall on the other side, there was nothing in the room, they take minimalistic to a whole other level.

944,Stayed at Smartroom last night.Good location especially for an overnight before traveling from Barcelona Sant early departure.Clean and neat as a pin no doubt.BUT- Paper thin walls so you hear every movement from rooms either side and above. Light sleepers beware. Also if you are larger than a thin short model - you will battle to fit in the shower cubicle let alone wash yourself. The smallest shower I have ever had the misfortune of using.Something needs to be done urgently to address these two issues or there will be no returning guests.The staff are great and very helpful,"July 11, 2017","17    SmartRoom Barcelona

Needed it urgently and had to go to the lobby to make work calls which I couldn't do in quiets - breakfast was average payed 8 euro and we ate late in the morning, many dishes not replenished.- paper thin walls, had some very noisy neighbours and could hear everything going on in their room....

All staff that we spoke to was helpful and friendly and had perfect English and answer any questions put to them. The room had adequate space for a few nights although the bathroom is small and the shower is tiny and I'm 5 foot 1! The hotel is in a residential area but there are loads of cafes supermarkets etc nearby but we did struggle to find somewhere on an evening that catered for English. I would recommend getting a taxi from airport costs €26 as the hotel is quite difficult to find.Nou camp is about a 25 min walk away. We also travelled into the main part of Barcelona via underground and this was quite easy to use. All in all a good stay ,"June 12, 2017","17    SmartRoom Barcelona

957,"This hotel has everything you need and provides a comfortable retreat after a busy day of exploring the city. The room was fairly quiet (though one night the gentleman next door could be heard snoring!) and was always clean and tidy. One reviewer mentions their annoyance about the towels not being cleaned but as is clearly noted in the bathroom, towels are only replaced when left on the floor in order to conserve water! The area is slightly out of the centre but this is not necessarily a bad thing as it's a nice neighbourhood (mostly full of retired locals it seems) and you can be in the centre of the city within 20 mins if you take the (very reasonably priced) metro from Plaça de Sants. After reading that some rooms looked out onto another building, we requested a room with a view and the hotel obliged (admittedly this may have been down to chance) and we enjoyed a pleasant view from the third floor over the neighbouring rooftops. There is a TV in the room (brush up on your language skills by watching the Simpsons with Catalan subtitles ;)) and some hanging room for your clothes. Breakfast is pretty decent, though at €7 each, you might be better off just picking up a pastry down the road and some fruit juice from Dia (the local supermarket) I would say this hotel is more 3 star than 2 star (no bottles of toiletries but there is a hairdryer and a soap dispenser in the shower) and the only thing missing is a mini fridge in your room to store your drinks (though you can just buy a cold bottle of water from reception for 80 cents.

959,"I stayed at Smart Room Barcelona for 3 nights and was looking for a hotel for a good price not so far from the main railway station Barcelona Sants. I had no complaints. I booked a budget twin room for myself, so it was big enough. 1-bed rooms in Barcelona can be pretty small, but this was big enough for 2 persons (2 seperate beds).Everything is clean, no weird smells, free fast WIFI (browsing Facebook or instagram with video's was no problem) and a 24-hour reception (no stress if your flight is late).In 10-15 minutes you can walk to the central station where you have metro and trains, so you can easily travel around Barcelona and to the airport.Just a few remarks. I had a room with a window on the 4th floor facing a small courtyard (so actually just some walls). So not much direct light/sun in your room. But that was OK because I was only there for sleeping. I slept well in general, except a few loud neighbours (but that's something you have in every hotel i guess). The first night was quite hot, so I couldn't sleep that well. It was only march, but still 20+ degrees and was not sure if the airco was working or not. But overall I slept good.If I go back, i'll book again here.","March 10, 2017","17    SmartRoom Barcelona

TV and facilities where great also. they even had a mini fridge in there which was usefull. plenty of lighting. it was a shame the building is currently going under works and the aircon wasn't great it was pointless putting on to be honest, so we had the windows open but the scaffolding was right there on our view and workers working passed.. this wasn't great experiance for us as we had windows open but curtains shut ? however if i were to revisit I CERTAINLY WOULD !!! i think it's a good hotel, and I have visited higher rated hotels and i think this tops it. very stylish modern and centric. love it thank you for having us.","June 7, 2019","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

One small criticism with my original stay was that the bath tub was pretty narrow for a larger person like me and i had to ring down for a bath plug, which was surely avoidable?.....but this is a minor quibble....The hotel is very well situated....approx 15 min walk to the Plaza de la Catalunya and equal approximate distance to Plaza d'Espanya...Be wary of Taxis.......i got an official taxi to take me to Sants Station because it was raining and i got charged €10.40 for the 1.1km......outrageous.....On my return to Sercotel art hotel, the staff, who were excellent for both stays, very kindly upgraded me to a larger room at no extra expense, which was very appreciated.......(this room definitely had a bigger bath tub by the way)I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Barcelona and i would fully anticipate staying here again.Bravo!!","May 27, 2019","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

989,"Overall, I would recommend this hotel for a solo traveler or a family with slightly older children or those who can't walk. The younger, faster, more curious, and agile ""stick your head and body through openings"" kind of toddler would make me very nervous at this location. In full disclosure, it is a 20-25 minute walk from the city center and Las Ramblas. It is a great walk with so many different routes lined with diverse bars, restaurants, and cafes. The hotel does have bicycles and stand up scooters available (sorry I don't know if there is a fee) for use. Pros: daily breakfast buffet was pretty good (champagne, fresh juices, water, teas, coffee, latte, espresso, scrambled eggs, potato, cold current, cheeses, breads, pastries, fruit, cereals). Plenty local of bars, restaurants, supermarkets, pizza shops right outside. The hotel room was a decent size that was clean. Front desk team is extremely helpful with planning your day. Plenty of taxis right outside and right on a bus route.Cons: it is not centrally located in the tourist hotspots (which I loved). If a central location is important to you, this might be an issue. The pool :( on the rooftop is a little bigger than a large jacuzzi. You will not be doing any laps. The center of the hotel is a nicely decorated open space from floor 0 to the rooftop that I can see a busy toddler getting into some trouble. There are very secure and clean gates, but we know toddlers.Overall, I liked the hotel and I would stay here again.","February 19, 2019","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

The hotel location is the only true drawback...you should expect to use taxis, or walk A LOT. I love to walk, but it’s was a bit too much for me. {The LIDL supermarket nearby was convenient. } The hotel really should use sound-dampening material on the rooms’ door frames - accidental slamming of doors by any guests means EVERYONE hears it— it’s because of the center-elevator configuration.

Our room was exceptionally clean but very very warm - the air con didn’t work.On arrival we were told that the Terrace Bar would be closed as this was low season - we were disappointed as the only other place to get a drink or something to eat was the main restaurant. After a long day shopping and sightseeing we were surprised to see a hanging poster saying that the Terrace Bar would open at 7.30pm - it didn’t. We waited in the restaurant for 10 minutes but didn’t see a soul. We ventured to another restaurant which was close to the hotel but didn’t feel comfortable walking around at night in this part of Barcelona.On our return we found the light in the lift was still broken even though we had reported it to the receptionist so had to get to the 7th floor in total darkness.The following morning, as we were leaving, the lift light still did not work and again, we reported it to the receptionist.The receptionist very kindly ordered us a taxi to the airport.

997,"This hotel is a great choice for those who want to stay in a calm area or go to the small shop without any queues in Barcelona and the same time not to be too far from the city center. I really loved the hotel. It’s very cozy, has unique style and modern design. Our room was really comfortable. It had a spacious bathroom and good amenities. The only bad thing was the window in the room, which was opening to the inner part of the hotel. So no view, no sun :) The bed was very comfy. Loved it! And of course, what’s the most important. It’s very very clean hotel. Reception staff was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I can’t remember the names of all receptionists, so I’ll mention only Giorgio’s name. Wanna thank all of them though for great reception, easy checkin and checkout, professional and pleasant attitude. Room service and the restaurant on the rooftop has some special operating hours, so check in the reception not to be hungry at night. The only reason I’m giving 4 stars out of 5, is the location. For someone, who wants to explore the central area of Barcelona, this hotel is a bit far from the crowd. It can be positive thing for some and negative for the others. This’s only my opinion after all. You need to walk 8-12 minutes to The closest metro station: Urgell, Rocafort or Hospital Clinic. All 3 are more or less the same distance. The main station: Sants Estacio is 15 minutes away. Also walkable if you have time. So, overall I can advise this hotel to anyone who wants to have a good time in a quiet area, clean, comfortable hotel but a bit far from crazy parts of Barcelona.

The street noise was elevated but we used a fan app on my phone to help drown it out. My only negative was one evening when my cousin and I took a sparkling water and a soda to the rooftop pool area, an employee asked us to leave. I feel that she should have said ""May I get you something to drink? Unfortunately outside drinks are not allowed."" Instead of ""You can't drink that here. Only still water."" She was abrupt with us and when a person is paying to stay at the hotel, I would expect to feel welcomed instead of run off from a lovely area.

The women requested a hair dryer that worked. Not provided. Our tub backed up during our shower over our ankles. When I told the front desk, without looking up, the clerk said there was a lot a rain recently and all of the drains were backing up. This was a total lie because our traveling companion staying in the room next door had no such problem. The staff did not offer us another room. The nine Euro box lunch was a joke and the breakfast bar had rotten fruit in the fruit bowl. To top it off, even though they advertise being close to the Metro, this is not true. We lugged our bags for blocks to reach this place after our flight arrived from Iceland. To top it off, we requested the front desk clerk to call a cab for us.

Bed situation was bad being two single beds pushed together, which kept on splitting, this should not be advertised as a double. The room needed repairing as chips in walls,door frames badly damaged. Weather was 30 plus degrees and aircon barely worked. The ""pool"" if you can call it that was the size of 2/3 argos paddling pools which was photographed at an angle to make it look full size. This was disappointing as a pool was a factor in choosing the hotel. Their was no iron in the room, i had to ring to get a one, which was a cheap iron with no cover so the water would go everywhere. Tv barely worked so had to stream off phone. The room was clean though. To conclude the price paid does not match the standard of the hotel and 100% not 4star standard more of a low 3 star.

1010,We have stayed at the Amister Hotel before and there seems to have been a change of management since. The hotel was very short staffed - one example - no tea bags were replaced but the receptionist could not leave his desk as there was no one about. We had to collect them ourselves. The staff were all new and had been asked to deliver the same spiel whether it be true or not. On one evening we went to the Roof top bar only to find there was no one there to serve the drinks!Most of the staff felt uptight and had no idea how to deal with any problems. All in all not impressed.,"July 12, 2018","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

1011,"Stayed here with family for 3 nights. Hotel is clean, service is friendly - though a bit clueless at times, and the breakfast buffet is good. Wifi is quite good. Rooms are a decent size with a large bathroom. However the rooms lack seating space, except for an armchair, and are a bit bare - you'd expect a 4 star hotel to be better furnished. We had issues with the TV and the kettle, and the front desk, though helpful, wasn't exactly efficient in addressing our problems.The hotel location is convenient, but not excellent. If you are averse to walking for 15-20 minutes to reach a bus stop, especially if you have small children or elderly people with you, then you probably would want to look for some other hotel. If you don't mind a short walk, then this hotel offers excellent value. Taxis are easily available, and the average fare to Placa Catalunya/Ramblas was 10 Euro.There are quite a few reasonably priced cafes and restaurants close by, and we liked exploring the area around the hotel. Overall, this hotel is good value for money.","July 12, 2018","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

1012,"My wife and I stayed here in Barcelona for 4-days/3-nights coming off our cruise; from check-in to check-out and everything in between - nothing but pleasant, professional, helpful staff (Giorgio and Christine were awesome) and extremely comfortable and clean facilities. Larger than normal rooms and bathrooms, free breakfast buffet with lots of variety, fitness center, located near metro or walking distance of several great restaurants and sights to see in Barcelona (we love to walk so we took advantage of this location to hit Gaudi's Sagrata Familia, Casa Batllo, and the las Ramblas promonade). If you are not a walker, plenty of taxis in area to hail and utilize. Rooftop terrace, bar and plunge pool very refreshing after a full day of walking or touring the city. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues whether traveling to Barcelona on business or pleasure.","July 5, 2018","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

1013,"We stayed at the Sercotel Amister Art Hotel for six nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is well placed, about seven minutes walk from Ugell, Rocafort and Entenca metro stations. The hotel itself is clean with huge beds, friendly staff and a nice feel about it. We enjoyed the roof terrace and plunge pool - a welcome relief in the hot sun and after much walking around the city. We complained on one occasion when some urban rap music with many offensive swear words was being played on loop on the terrace, a really odd choice and definitely not family friendly, but the manager responded personally and it never happened again so we felt much more comfortable after that. All in all we would definitely return, thanks to all the team. ","June 2, 2018","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

Buffet breakfast offered a wide variety -- eggs, meats, cheeses, breads, pastries, cereals, fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee, etc. Staff was friendly and helpful. Nice artsy decor throughout the hotel, with an interesting rather circular layout. Our room window provided light but no view. The rooftop terrace is very nice, however the weather was too cool for us to enjoy it. This hotel is not very close in to some of the Barcelona attractions, but there are several metro stations within walking distance, so we were easily able to get to the areas we wanted to visit (we've been to Barcelona several times). We also easily walked to the Barcelona Sants train station for a day trip to Girona. We took a taxi to the port to board our cruise ship for about 17 euros.","May 31, 2018","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

We didn’t use the Restaurant in the hotel so cannot comment vn the food. Hotel is about 25 minutes walk from la Rambla and the main tourist area - really enjoyed the location as we were able to visit some great cafes, bars and restaurants in this part of town which were full of local people which gave us a really different experience from our previous visits to the city.Would definitely stay here again.","May 10, 2018","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

1018,"I was looking forward to staying at this hotel as the photos and reviews looked very impressive, here are a few things you should be aware of. I’d say that in comparison to other hotels I’ve stayed in , this one is over priced for the amenity’s, the staff were fairly helpful but when we spoke to the director he was pretty rude when we complained about the lack of air con. I mean what woman would want to get changed/ sleep with a window open when you have a main road and a construction site opposite? Have a look at other hotels in the area, you’ll get more value for money. Building site - There is the construction of a new block of flats/ hotel right next to this hotel looking now at other reviews it’s been going on for at least a year and isn’t showing signs of stopping! The photos don't really include this, so be prepared for construction noise from early morning to early evening. For anyone staying in the rooms next to the main road it’s pretty loud, also this is very loud whilst on the rooftop bar so makes for a less than relaxing experience. Bedrooms- We booked a room to sleep three, the room itself was nice enough and the bathroom was spacious, however all they’d done was add a cot bed into the space where the bedside table had been which was disappointing as I’d have expected three actual beds. This room is comfortable for two people but it’s a push to accommodate three and becomes very cramped. The bathroom is always very warm also as there isn’t any real air conditioning in it and what air-conditioning IS available in the rooms is at the mercy of the hotel director. This means that if they decide to, it will only blow hot air OR cold – which you’ll appreciate in a room with 3 people and a construction site/ main road outside, opening the windows ( which was the suggestion when we complained to the hotel director ) Isn’t the best solution for this problem so we had no air con for 2 out of the 3 days we stayed.Roof top bar-There IS one on the roof but it isn’t open at the moment, I think it does opens in the summer however. If you want to have a drink on the roof, you must ring the bell for a waiter to come and take your order and they will go away /make the drink and return with it. It’s easier to just bring up your own and store it in the mini fridge in your room, which you can purchase from the local “supermarcat” across the road ( you’re welcome). As for the pool, well… Let’s say that if you pushed off from the edge you’d hit your head in the other side, it’s about the size of a large Jacuzzi and could only accommodate 4/5 people at most . With the construction site opposite I can’t see many people taking advantage of the pool/ sunbeds, but with enough alchohol anything is fun!Checking in/ out- When we arrived it was around 11am, we were told check in wasn’t until 2pm but if we paid an extra 10 euros per room we could go in early, most hotels I’ve stayed in just let you in and don’t charge for it! Also there is a “city tax “which we had to pay, this was 1.80 euro a day, per person and per room. By the time we checked out, we owed an extra 47 euros between the five of us (over two rooms) and that was without air con for two days !","April 9, 2018","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

1021,"Stayed here 1 night in a double room (single use). Chose this hotel mainly for the location (proximity to Barcelona Sants railway station) and reasonable price (prepaid offer). Liked:+ Very comfortable bed, linen and pillows. Had a good sleep!+ A safety box, a kettle (+free tea, coffee, water) and mini-bar in the room.+ Friendly staff at the reception. + Convenient location for those who need to travel somewhere from Sants railway station (not more than 15 min on foot). About 10 min from one of the stops of Aerobus from the airport (Gran Via - Urgell). About 15 min to the Magic Fountain. In the nice neighbourhood of Eixample.+ Good value for money (in my case). Disliked:- The fact that my room had a door (locked) to the adjacent room. You can hear everything that happens in the neighbouring room through this door. If I'd stayed at the hotel longer than 1 night, I'd have asked to change the room. Fortunately, our timetable about when to go to bed coincided and it was quiet at night but in the evening I was ""lucky"" to listen to a ""live pop concert"" with my neighbour as a soloist:) - Not the best condition of the bathroom. The bidet was leaking.GENERAL IMPRESSION. Positive but 1) make sure you need this very location. If you are interested in the very centre of the city (the main part of Las Ramblas, Barrio Gotico or Liceu), this hotel is a little bit far away.2) avoid rooms which are supposed to be adjacent. WOULD I RETURN? Yes, to a quieter room, if I needed again this location and if the price were similar to what I paid.","March 29, 2018","18    Sercotel Amister Art Hotel

The Rooms are very modern, extremely clean and beds extremely comfortable - proper duvets and soft pillows, not just blankets which you get in must hotels. Bathroom is extremely spacious as there is plenty of room between the toilet and the shower/bath, great mist free mirrors and very soft towels!Breakfast is a bit better than your standard buffet breakfast on the continent, but you have all the necessaries and can eat as must as you want!The service was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, they recommended were to go and showed us in detail how to get there. They even sorted us out with FC Barcelona tickets an hour before the match at cost price.The hotel is within walking distance of everywhere. It is only 10 minutes walk from Sants train station, which has a regular train every 30mins to the airport. 15/20 minute walk from Las Rambla and Pl. de Catalunya, one of the main shopping and dinning areas, 15 minutes to Sagrada Família and 20 minutes walk from the Nou Camp.When we were checking out, I was very impressed with the way staff handled a very awkward and rude American pair, who were complaining and giving out before they even checking in.

From the hotel you can walk 5 mins to Encants flea market and the bottom of Av. Diagonal and around 15-20 mins stroll to Sagarda Familia. It's not in the centre of town but I think the trade off in price and quietness makes the location great! The hotel itself is really nice, it's clean and modern and the staff were all really friendly. There is a computer and printer in reception you can use (I think 50 cents for 10 mins) if you need to print tickets etc. There is also a vending machine and the reception is 24 hours. The breakfast is good, moslty cold but nice bread and meat and cheese etc and an instant hot drink machine. Was nice to have but not sure I'd pay the 9 euro it would cost seperately when there are a number of cafes nearby. The room itself was nice. I had been allocated a room with a double and a single bed so it was quite big and the bathroom was modern and everything worked. No view from my bedroom but possible from higher floors. My only disappointment was that the walls are SO thin. Some people were talking in their room and I actually had to check they weren't right outside my door. Also the cleaner starts at 8 am and the thin walls mean that you can hear the inevitable noise. Maybe I was just unlucky I had loud guests but bear in mind if you're looking to sleep in late you may struggle. That being said a room on the higher floors may help this.Overall reallly nice hotel, for 1-3 night stays I think a great choice!","January 25, 2019","19    Hotel Teatre Auditori

We slept well in the comfortable beds and although it wasn't a particularly large room, the bathroom was spacious with an excellent shower. Plenty of towels were provided as well as soap and shower gel. The windows had very effective black-out curtains as well as lighter ones for privacy. There was a small fridge in the room as well as tea-making facilities. Although our room looked out onto an apartment block, it was very quiet at night. We could also see a rather beautiful religious building, which housed a school so there was some playground noise in the morning if the window was open. The hotel is opposite the National Theatre of Catalunya as well as a major concert hall so it's worth looking to see if you can catch a concert whilst you are there. There are various metro stations and bus stops close by and it is only a short walk to the Sagrada Familia. All in all a good place to stay and we'd recommend it for good value.We would have liked a couple of coat hooks and another for towels in the bathroom. It was just slightly shabby round the edges in our room. Arriving at Glories Metro at 21.30 was somewhat disconcerting as the area looked very bleak and we didn't find it particularly easy to find the road we needed. The following day we realised that we'd gone further than we'd needed to. So, if arriving at night, do your research beforehand and it'll only take you 5 minutes!","December 22, 2018","19    Hotel Teatre Auditori

In fact, it was large enough that there was room for a small table and chairs to supplement the small desk and single chair. The bathroom was larger than expected, with a very good shower. The beds were comfortable, especially if you like a slightly soft mattress. There was a safe and a kettle for heating water for tea and instant coffee. In-room Wifi was free and reasonably fast. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. My only complaint is the need to feed coins into the computer in the lobby to use the internet and print out tickets, boarding passes, etc. The fee is low, but annoying.

We arrived at the hotel with the concierge showing us to our room and presenting a half soaked bathroom because of a leak in the ceiling, and then as an alternative was offered a room with no window that smelled of damp. With no choice but to take the room with the leak, we discovered that the window looked into the foyer and all we could see of outside was the pavement , with no idea of whether it was light or dark outside. Next day we complained and got palmed off by an extremely rude and arrogant member of staff, only to be offered the room with no window again and were told we were lying about the leak!The second night we moved to another hotel, hotel Catalonia park Putxet, which was well worth paying extra for than staying in that pathetic excuse for a hotel.

They were able to help us get a “sagrada familia - gaudi” tour last minute, which i also really recommend.Breakfast is simple but theres a wide variety for all tastes. Always had multiple options of fruit, cereal, bread, eggs, etc.The only issue we had was one of the days we decided to sleep in longer and the cleaning lady came into the room saying that if we wanted her to clean the room it had to be now. We had no problem, as we told her, waiting until the next day to have our rooms cleaned, it was just extremelly unconfortable for my friend and I to be woken up with a woman inside our room.Nonetheless, i would recommend it if you are staying in Barcelona for a few days.

Fresh fruit from melon, strawberries, mango, apples, bananas, grapes etc.Concentrated juices not bad but I prefer water in those cases. Coffee not bad for a automatic machine.Choice of cakes, biscuits, jams. Bacon, sausage, beans, egg. Breads of different kinds, croissants (not the best), omelette excellent for one that is not home made, tastes almost like home made. Really nothing bad at all.

1070,Visited with my boyfriend for a city break for four days and loved the fact that the room we had booked was almost like a small apartment. It was very novel to have two arm chairs to sit at separate from the bed which meant we could eat our lidl breakfast in comfort as well as having a small fridge to be able to use. I think the only negative would be the location. Although it was easy enough to walk to the tube to then get into the city it was a bit of a quiet area with not many nearby shops and restaurants that you'd want to eat at. We ended up grabbing some supplies from Lidl a 10 minute walk away and then knowing that if we wanted something more substantial we'd have to travel into town.

The Bullard bakery on the ground flour became the best place for breakfast - we’ve visited other cafeterias nearby, but the choice and coffee were a lot worse there. If you feel that you want a more nutritious breakfast than sandwiches, pastries, yogurts, smoothies, fruits and coffee which bakery offers - take the hotel breakfast (it’s 10 euro per person and there are also eggs, jams, cheese, ham and cereals). Our room was small but it’s okay for 2 people, no more. There were no problems with anything in it. It’s clean, light in colour and well-organised. The staff are speaking English fluently and are ready to answer any questions. We had difficulties with paying by credit card because of our bank which didn’t allow it.

The hotel is located above a bakery that has been operating with the same family for several generations. The aroma is intoxicating (and the pastries are outstanding!). The hotel is clean, very modern rooms that are small but have everything you need. It's located very close to Gaudi's La Pedrera and bus/metro lines. The staff couldn't have been nicer (let us keep us our luggage there after checkout until we left for an evening flight) and there is a room on the 1st floor for hotel guests to use the Internet and just sit and relax.

Not a good start. Staff member finally arrived & a quick checkin & into our room.Room smallish but already was aware of that, very clean, great bedding, pillows & towels also very good, Complimentary shampoo & conditioner, moisturiser, no glasses only plastic cups & no fridge, very good aircon as extremely hot on our stay. We had breakfast one morning & ticks all the right boxes as breakfast goes. You can also just order coffees & pastries/ toasted sandwiches from bakery & bring them into cafe/breakfast area in Hotel if you want. Hotel is in a fabulous location, many bars/tapas & restaurants in this area. Easy walk to main tourist areas where you can catch hop on/off buses.

Room was very clean, bright and the perfect size for me as a single. A couple would be comfy as well. The room is small, but who cares?? Americans seeking an American sized hotel room need to stay in a Marriott hotel. The bed was amazing and linens crisp. Bathroom was compact but updated. Large shower with separate toilet; a pocket door separates this from the bed. Bright window lead to a Juliette balcony. Blackout drape was provided. A/C was adjustable, but I didn’t need to lower it even as temperatures outside climbed to 90F. Towels were soft and replaced each day; safe under the sink.This is a modern, bright, European style hotel. The location is fantastic for those wanting to site see or just stroll through the neighborhoods. Closest to La Pederera; Casa Batlo; Passeig Gràcia; Casa Vincenz; 20 minute walk to Sagrada Familia.

1110,"Good location, clean and comfortable rooms (if a little small... the shower was almost half the size of the bedroom, design team did not get that quite right). Although decor was crisp and attractive, it seemed a bit like style over substance.The smell of freshly baked bread in the morning is a dream to wake up to, sets the hunger pangs into action on opening your eyes! The coffee was the most delicious we tasted in Barcelona, which is a huge positive, but also the biggest negative, the breakfast which is supplied by the hotel included a coffee from a Nespresso machine, which is a little gimmicky. Not even a fresh pot. When we asked the reception staff, the lady said that the coffee was ‘supplied by a separate company, and was not included in the price of the breakfast’ this was a huge disappointment, surely this could be negotiated with the company...? We ended up buying our coffee separately. They were clearly able to supply the baked goods as part of the breakfast, so why not the coffee? It felt as though they really could not be bothered. Paying customers at the hotel, having to pay for the coffee separately is not an acceptable package. Not a complete customer oriented experience. The cafe was also closed on Monday, which we were not advised of, we came down to check out and to pick up a croissant to go, and the whole of downstairs was closed, again, disappointing - should be made aware of this if offering ‘breakfast’.Not terrible, but would not visit again.","June 15, 2019","20    Hotel Praktik Bakery

1111,"I want to preface this review by stating I am a high maintenance American female. This review may not be helpful for everyone, but if you are also a little high maintenance, this maybe just what you need. The hotel is a legit bakery. You wake up every morning smelling fresh baked bread and pastries, which could be a good or bad thing. For me, I didn’t mind it. My room faced the back of the hotel, but I’ve heard from coworkers, if you are faced in the front of the hotel, you most likely be woken up around 3-4 am by the delivery trucks being unloaded. The room itself was extremely small. When I first entered it, I HATED, but it has grown on me. If this had been a personal trip, rather than for business, my husband would have never of fit. The first day, I had asked for extra hangers. The 5 provided in the room wouldn’t cut it for my 2 week work stay. They said they didn’t have any extra, which I found strange since they do offer laundry service. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying. The first 2 nights my toilet ran the ENTIRE night. Until I figured out how to tap the small flush panel just right, it would have run the entire time. Annoying for me, costly for the hotel. The one thing that would persuade me to never stay at this hotel again is the fact that you can not control the temperature in your own room. It is controlled by the hotel. Every night I had to request the manager to turn up my AC. I run HOT, sleeping in 23 degree conditions just doesn’t work. Even when he turned it up, it still never got cold enough. He was super nice and helpful though, told me to call down if I didn’t notice a difference and he would have someone come look at it. I noticed the slightest difference, but it just still wasn’t cold enough. Overall, the staff is extremely nice and very accommodating. I arrive at 11 am, when check in wasn’t until 4 pm, and they still allowed me to get into their only available room. I am here on business for 2 weeks and was only able to get into this hotel for 6 days, so they obviously do really well, it just wasn’t for me.","June 13, 2019","20    Hotel Praktik Bakery

1118,"This small hotel was perfect for my week in Barcelona. It has been refurbished and now has a funky, modern vibe. A fun quirk is the bakery in reception, where you can see the bakers busily producing the days bread and delicious patisseries. Then you can buy the bakery goods and ready made salads and coffee at the bakery counter which adjoins reception. However, if you just want unadorned fresh bread to do your own catering, you need to go round the corner to the shop itself, where you can buy fresh loaves and bread by weight. There is a breakfast buffet but I didn't try it, preferring to cater for myself. Happily the hotel doesn't mind of you are a guest and bring your own food to the dining room. My room had french doors with a little railling so you coule look out and see Sagrada Famiglia further down the street. It was about 20 minutes walk away. Casa Mila is on the next corner from the hotel. Very convenient location with most things within walking distance.My room was lovely. All clean and white. It was a grrat size for one.

First impressions where very good, the entrance is filled with cakes and freshly made bread from the bakery, it's clear the bakery is a popular destination amongst tourists and locals. The room was very well designed, although smaller than anticipated; but this wasn't an issue. The use of this intricate space seemed very clever. We had a large double bed covered in white bedding. There wasn't a spec of dust or dirt to be found anywhere. The view from the balcony is a nice compliment to the room.The staff in the hotel are very helpful, they will be able to provide you with directions, transport links, tourist information and off course they can give you great recommendations on which pastries taste the best. Like most places, you can store your luggage when you check out. I'd definitely stay here again. Hotels in Barcelona can be fairly expensive, but this hotel offers a very competitive option. Tip: The bakery downstairs does serve the public as well as hotel guests.

1125,"4 of us spent 3 days in Barcelona at the end of a long cruise. A friend familiar with Barcelona recommended an area to stay in that was central to many of the great sights and we selected the Praktik Bakery. To be honest, the thought of a bakery at the ground floor of our hotel helped seal the deal. Bakeries are so hard to find in the USA these days.What an amazing place! It was not just a bakery, but the best one around - we know because we tried others during our walking around. But, we all know the purpose of a hotel stay is also the room. The room was clean, relatively large by European standards, quiet and comfortable. The shower was also amazing - a large rainfall type shower that was quite relaxing. The front desk was very accommodating - even to printing out tickets purchased on-line and boarding passes for us. We walked everywhere and this hotel is central to many attractions. Finally, it was very reasonably priced. When we return to Barcelona we will definitely look to stay at the Praktik Bakery again!","May 11, 2019","20    Hotel Praktik Bakery

1127,"We need to pay the apartment, as we arrived. Afterwards we first got the chance to see to see the apartment. It was not as clean as expected and the bedsheet was not wrapped around the blanked, as it usually is. So you’re skin touches the blanked itself: we don’t feel comfortable with that. We also expected a nice view (old buildings with small balconies) as it’s shown on the pictures. Instead there was a backyard and no balcony.We asked very friendly if there is the possibility to get another room. The receptionist told us, that the pictures on Booking must be a mistake. He doesn’t know a room like shown at this Hotel.I need to show him the Booking a few times, till he believes that it is not my own booking fault. All this takes an hour or so. Too much, for getting a solution.By the way. There is no solution yet. The receptionist told us, that he hasn’t the power to take a decision.The Bakery is fine. Products are great.

There is NO place to put more than one suitcase except on the floor. Breakfast at 11 Euros each is way overpriced. Better to buy your breakfast at the hotel's bakery where you have a far better selection. And clearly better to take a taxi rather than to walk in Barcelona. The crooks can spot a tourist a mile away and their bag of tricks to take your valuables and make them theirs is creative, to say the least. Beware.","May 2, 2019","20    Hotel Praktik Bakery

The Bakery on the Main Level is part of the Hotel and of amazing quality and variety. The Rooms are spotless clean and modern with a very nice Shower. The downside was that aside from the Bed(s), there is nowhere to sit.

1132,"My sister recently moved to Barcelona so I was coming over to visit her. I have just returned from a recent stay here with my 22 month old daughter. We had originally booked a different hotel and the booking got cancelled by the hotel. We then stumbled across this one. As annoyed as I was at the original hotel I’m so happy it got cancelled. I loved this hotel! I had booked a baby cot and requested early check in. The cot was made up in the room and the room ready early. The room was much smaller than I imagined, but absolutely perfect! Everything needed was there, it was lovely! The shower was great. There is a small shower also if you don’t want to wash your hair (or, in my case, for the toddler to use). The bed was massive and comfy and had enough room to pop my folded down stroller under it at nights. On night one my daughter got sick over the bed and me. I requested fresh bed sheets, we had to wait a long time for them to arrive but there was only one person in reception, and he was busy. When we checked out the hotel kept my bag until I left for the airport. Every staff member I spoke to were friendly and helpful. All in all a most wonderful hotel. The bakery and breakfast was so tasty. The only silly downside for me was there was only 2 English tv channels (which were serious American news channels). Silly complaint, but when my baby went to sleep early, I’d nothing to do as forgot my book. Also, there is no kettle in the room. I had brought my own local tea bags with me, so every night I brought a cup of hot water up from reception for my tea. Totally silly downsides which I can deal with. All in all, I will be staying here again when I visit my sister next. Hopefully it’s soon. I’ll remember my book, and my tea bags and I’ll have just as lovely time!","April 22, 2019","20    Hotel Praktik Bakery

Our room also had speakers in the main area and the bathroom that connected to our phone to play music, which I really enjoyed! The breakfast was pretty standard, but good (eggs, bacon, veggies, fruit, fresh croissants and pastries, etc). There were some staple dishes, like eggs and pastries, seen every day, but other dishes were swapped out. My sister loved the espresso machine.

Bottled water provided every day which not all hotels offer. The whole hotel is well maintained. Check in staff were very polite and spoke good English. We had the buffet breakfast at extra cost as it was not included in our room rate, there was enough choice to satisfy lighter eaters and those who want a more substantial breakfast.

I personally would say don't eat there. Barcelona restaurants have too much delicious food to be tried. The location was excellent and very central to so many great things.

1160,"First impressions of the hotel was a stylish little hotel with very friendly staff. The little added touch of a cable or bluetooth to connect personal music to the rooms really helped it live up to the name. The room itself was clean with large comfortable beds. The bathroom was also clean with a powerful shower over the bath. We’d paid for breakfast which had a decent spread of cooked breakfast, cold meats and pastries. The only disappointment for me with the breakfast was the cold baked beans which seemed a little odd but that really is picking fault. The location of the hotel was great. It is located right by the gothic quarter with a huge amount of small twisty streets to explore. It was also a very short walk from a metro station. My main criticism was down to the description of the room, which may be more down to Expedia than the hotel. I booked a superior room which was advertised as having a balcony. This was one of my main attractions to the hotel over others I was looking at in Barcelona for a similar price. The room I was allocated, while being a superior room did not have a balcony. I didn’t complain given that looking at the front of the hotel, even the rooms that had a balcony didn’t seem to have anything that could be described as more than a Juliet balcony. If you were looking for a hotel where you could sit out and enjoy watching the world go by I would suggest looking elsewhere. ","October 12, 2018","21    Musik Boutique Hotel

1163,"Superb and way and beyond experience stay in Barcelona !!!. The room was perfect as I was traveling with my mom and I am a bit claustrophobic . The big windows helped a lot . When we arrived late at night we were already in doubt about the neighborhood safety , but that changed the following day when we walked around the neighborhood , the proximity of the attractions , restaurants , shops , grocery stores , cafes etc was just within reach . Musik Boutique gives you that Catalan culture experience away from the touristy crowds which me and my mom loved as you come out and explore the narrow streets of Ciutat Vella , El gothic and El born . The receptionists were very knowledgeable , helpful , and courteous , all spoke in English !!!! Help me navigate Barcelona , where to go , and where to eat . We were ensured that the neighborhood is safe , no violence but just be extra careful about the pick pockets which we already knew . Our room was tidied up everyday , , everything we need was provided . BTW I have traveled over 15 years and I have to say that the beds were very comfy and beyond a 3 star standard , we had a restful sleep for 8 nights which is very rare for travelers like us . We felt like we were at home . The breakfast buffet was free the first day but we opted to just pay extra for a few days for the breakfast . The food is great and the staff in the kitchen were amazing !!! Emerald prepared a freshly baked croissant for my mom and she appreciated that too much . There are good cafes outside the hotel which we also loved . The location is perfect !!!! Diversity is amazing !!!Tucked in to gothic quarter and el born . Ciutat vela is pretty . 5-10 mins walk to Barcelona’s attractions such as the Barcelona Cathedral / Barri Gòtic , Arc di triomf , plaza catalunya and many more . Hotel is close to the metro as well . Taxi cabs are also an option , but they won’t drop you off in front of the hotel due to the narrow streets which is not a big issue . Thanks again and I cannot think anything negative about the hotel . You are all amazing !!!! I will definitely consider to stay there again and refer you to my friends and family .

1165,"Me and my daughter stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is lovely inside, very clean and very modern. Location wise it was down a small narrow street which at first I was a bit wary of but soon got used to it and loved all the little shops and street art that we walked past to get back to the hotel. We walked back between 11pm and midnight every evening and there was always lots of people around. The safe was free to use which I thought very good for a 3 star hotel. Our room was on the 6th floor at the back and was very quiet at night time. There was also a fridge which was great. The beds were lovely and comfatable and the shower was amazing - lovely and big. We did not eat breakfast as it was not included in our room rate and there were plenty of places to get a croissant and coffee, however I heard the breakfast was very good. The hotel is perfectly located to walk to many of the sights including The Picasso museum, La Rambla and Arc de Triomf. Would definitely recommend this hotel.","September 5, 2018","21    Musik Boutique Hotel

1166,"Recently had the privilege of having a four night stay at the Musik Boutique Hotel with my girlfriend (staying 7 - 11 August 2018). The hotel is perfectly located about a 5 minute walk from the Arc de Triomf metro station and about a 10 minute from the hustle and bustle of the Las Ramblas strip, making it the perfect base for exploring all the points of interest in Barcelona. Despite being located in the Gothic quarter of the the city, the hotel is quite modernly decorated and furnished. The staff were warm and friendly and very helpful with recommending parts of Barcelona to see and was located near an array of amazing restaurants off the beaten track.Although the room was a double room, it was very spacious and came nicely equipped with a mini bar (although it would have been nice if it was pointed out that the things in the bar weren't complimentary). However, as it was such a good experience I would definitely recommend this hotel and wouldn't think twice about using it again.","August 28, 2018","21    Musik Boutique Hotel

1167,"We stayed in a suite for a week and it was lovely and quite comfortable. Although we intended to book a hotel in El Born, and thought we had, it turned out we were on the outskirts. Still, it was fine and convenient to many of the sites. The staff was quite helpful and friendly. My only complaint was that breakfast was not included, which it should have been for the price, and the cleaners should have changed our dirty glasses once or twice during the week. And, be warned, taxis are reluctant to drive to the entrance of the hotel --- they're afraid they'll be stuck on the narrow streets. They'll pick you up at the hotel but will refuse to drop you off at the hotel, including at all hours of the night, so be prepared to walk 10 or 15 minutes to the hotel. The area is known for pick pockets and can be confusing too, so be aware of your surroundings.","August 19, 2018","21    Musik Boutique Hotel

On the last day, we had to leave earlier than the start of breakfast service, and they kindly prepared the breakfast earlier so we were able to eat before leaving. A taxi was also booked for us. The room was perfect and so clean. We loved the modern bathroom, the free toiletries, the slippers. The beds were very comfortable. We also didnt hear anything from our neighbors. Wifi was perfect.We were on the last floor and in the middle of a heat wave, so the A/C had a bit of trouble cooling the room, but we were given a fan to help, which we appreciated.

1170,"I would like to preface this statement by saying that I am a well-seasoned traveller and I am NOT picky by any means. This hotel is super cute, with comfortable rooms and super comfy pillows. The check-in staff was super friendly and was nice after a super delayed flight from Mallorca. However, there was a GIANT issue that makes me post this (I still have five more nights here, btw). My friend and I got a room five flights up, no big deal. When we checked in, we were told the elevator was broken but we could leave our bags downstairs and could get it when the elevator works again. Ok, I admit I was a little annoyed, but understand these things happen. I was super tired and stayed awake longer than I wanted until the elevator was fixed. Ultimately, it got fixed. The next day, my friend and I had a VERY long day of climbing steps and walking uphill all over Barcelona (I was super happy that I doubled my step goal for the day). On the way home from dinner, we were beat. I jokingly said “Wouldn’t it suck if the elevator was broken again?” I totally said this joking, as how could this happen two days in a row? It did. We got back and the elevator was broken again. The LAST thing I wanted to do was climb stairs after climbing all day. I’m paying money for a hotel with a lift. I HOPE this doesn’t happen every day. I’m very bummed. To those of you with luggage, be comfortable climbing five flights with it and climbing five flights to go back to your room. This hotel has all the makings for five stars, however, this glaring issue only gives it two. I would love to recommend this hotel to friends and family who travel frequently to Barcelona but unless things change, I unfortunately cannot. ","July 21, 2018","21    Musik Boutique Hotel

Just walk with confidence and keep your phones etc secured and all is well. Quite a lot of activity in the neighbourhood by day and at night it gets pretty quiet. The hotel was excellent.

Located on quiet street. Front desk staff is very helpful. Your room key will come with a pouch showing suggested local restaurants. These suggestions are excellent, we in particular loved Ginette. The only negative, for which we cannot blame the hotel, was that one night we were getting back late, close to midnight and were harassed by a couple of guys. I guess this is a price to pay for being located on a small street, on the balance this is very minor. Our breakfast was not included and having tried a couple of places first two days we opted to have breakfasts in the hotel - worth extra 10 euros.

Rooms on the back side of the hotel look at a really dirty space last cleaned years ago.

The staff were friendly on arrival and gave us leaflets for local attractions and also helped us sort a taxi on the first evening. We stayed on the 4th floor overlooking La Rambla and had a little terrace which was nice to step on to and soak up the atmosphere. The soundproofing wasn’t bad either. Complimentary water in the room replaced every day was a welcome touch. Small points about the room but ones of note. Our room was dark!! That said it’s an old building and this time of year there are still leaves in the trees which are in front of the terrace door so that likely name it darker. There was no power supply near a mirror (other than the one in the bathroom which got foggy after showering) which, as a girl, I found annoying as we have things like hair straighteners to use and no mirror to stand in front of. The table in the room was a bit tired, the veneer was peeling on the legs and people had fairly obviously used the table to open beer bottles in the past. The other thing neither of us liked one bit were the little cushions placed on top of our pillows each day. they smelt! Old and musty and god knows how long since they had been cleaned. We put them on the chair each day and each day they were put back on the bed. No thank you!! Overall it’s a good place to stay to be right in the middle of it all but if we go back to Barcelona we won’t stay there again- id much sooner pay for something worth the money further out of the city.

1201,"We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel is situated toward the bottom end of the La Rambla, close to the marina, which makes the location ideal. We found the hotel to well presented, clean and tidy upon arrival.Room - Our room was what you expect from a 3 start hotel, but will say that that the room was clean, had good AC, a good safe, and fairly comfortable beds. The room also had a balcony which looked out to the El Ravel area. Where it was not the most picturesque view, I found it to be a nice touch to the room. They have free Wi-Fi, though unfortunately, not the most consistent in connection. I often found myself using the data from my phone. Staff – Reception staff were very professional and processed us quite quickly when checking in/out. I found the chambermaid/cleaning staff to be very friendly and often cleaned our rooms daily to a very good standard. All in all, I would say that we had a good stay and would recommend.","September 2, 2019","22    Hotel Arc La Rambla

The breakfast room is a hidden gem and has everything you want for breakfast. The bonus is the roof top garden with sun loungers which we used instead of going to the beach.

1204,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. People at the front desk were very nice and friendly.Rooms were rather small. Two twin beds pulled together and a small desk. Had to upgrade for €35/day. Got a room that was slightly bigger. Balcony was a joke. I’ll say 12 inches deep. The hotel was fully booked. So we got a room on the 1st floor(2nd for Americans). Breakfast was €13. You get 20% discount if you’ll eat there for 3 days. This hotel is conveniently located right on La Rambla. Market, supermarket, Metro station,shopping center around Plaza Catalunya were within walking distance. 20 minutes walk to the beach.Before you book make up your mind what do you prefer-Peaceful environment or loud music, drunken people screaming and fighting . La Rambla is a street where they sell souvenirs and have subpar places to eat.The whole area architecture wise is rather gloomy. All buildings are of dirty yellowish color. It is interesting to explore. Especially around 8 am and if you love photography. If you walk away from this area then you’ll be able to see locals not just tourists. Barcelona is beautiful and people are nice. ","August 30, 2019","22    Hotel Arc La Rambla

There was a bit of noise but no real issues, the balcony doors were semi soundproof. The room was clean and the air conditioning unit worked, you have to stand directly below the unit and point the remote at it! Very comfortable.There are patio restaurants and bistros all around.

1208,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The room, a junior suite was good. Clean, comfortable bed. Take note - they make you sign a document that says you'll have no one in your room. As a single traveller I incorrectly assumed they meant not having anyone else staying in the room. Yes - I should have read the document before signing. Anyway - I took friends from another hotel up to see my room. On showing my friends out - about 5 mins - the reception guy (Chilean) berated me for violating the document. I couldn't even explain to him what I assumed it meant. Every time I tried to speak he shouted over me. Then he says ""Barcelona has 80 million visitors and I don't care if you don't come back"", and he pointed to the cameras and said ""they are everywhere"". In the end I said, yes you're right and just walked off.","August 13, 2019","22    Hotel Arc La Rambla

We returned to Barcelona from Costa Brava for our last two days , and I decided to stay some place a little different. Las Ramblas is not our favorite hang out, but I loved looking down on the scene from our balcony . Our teenagers room had a largish terrace that looked out back, at the the graffiti and narrow streets. We ate lunch there from the good we brought back from the Boqueterua Market . I liked being close to Raval. We spent a Kate Saturday night at an outdoor neighborhood party/concert ( Raval Against the Machine) after a fantastic meal at Na Mindona.

1216,We stayed 2 nights at this hotel in June 2019. Service: 4 stars. Overall decent service. They were helpful only when you ask. Seem a little impatient with our tourist questions for restaurants and transportations. We were supposed to check in at 2pm but they delayed it til 2:40pm and we end having to run and rush to our tour by 3pm. They prepared lunch bags for us cuz we had a 6:45am tour and breakfast hour starts at 7am. Amenity: 3 stars. room size a bit tight but it seems standard for most Europe hotels. The shower head was super high so I couldn't reach to adjust angles. AC works fine. Breakfast was better than expected I wish I had more time to enjoy. WiFi speed is decent. You can rent lockers to put away your luggage for early check out or waiting to check in. Location: 4 stars. very convinient in the heart of La Rambla. 5 minute walk to must sightseeing places and restaurants. It was surprisingly quiet at night considering it's on a big street. Safety reminder: we were robbed in the early morning 6:30am on our way from hotel to tour meeting spot. Couple teenagers robbed our phone straight off my husband's hand and ran away. Stay alert if you head out in early morning or late evenings. Be careful when using google map on your phone.,"July 9, 2019","22    Hotel Arc La Rambla

The accessible bedroom and bathroom were very good-plenty of room to wheel in under the handbasin, perfect roll-in shower,grabrails in correct position.The only setback in this hotel is the size of the lift to the bedroom-you would not be able to manoeuvre a power chair in and out of it due to its positioning.

1242,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Barcelona for a weekend visit, this is a really good choice. Close to Plaça Catalunya, Sagrada Familia aswell as the Hop-on Hop-off busses at Casa Batlló (about 5-7 min walk).When arriving we got a really good introduction to Barcelona and a map where the guy in the reception marked places for us to visit. The room was very nice, clean and modern, if i were to mention something that was not so good it would be the sound/noise that you can hear from other rooms/corridor outside your room. Next to the hotel there is a supermarket for every-day needs and across the street there is a really nice restaurant named ""Lokal Bar"".There are plenty of cafés close by where you can eat breakfast since the hotel does not offer that service.","September 11, 2019","23    Hostal Martinval

1244,"We stayed for 3 nights in May in the Economy Triple Budget room. There was nothing Triple about it. The double rooms next door were the same size. Ours only had an extra bed. Even the double room is really tiny. And expensive at 100 euros a day.There is no table in the room to keep your things. Near the bed there is a small shelf 6 cm x 4 cm. Enough space to keep a smartphone. Ridiculous. Nothing else can be placed on the table. We actually had to keep our glasses, keys, watch on top of our bags.No kettle in the rooms. So you can forget hot water for tea coffee. And the coffee machine and water machine in the lobby did not work for the entire 4 days we were there. I complained about this on the 2nd day and the reception arranged a kettle for me.The location is good yes. But I really cannot recommend this hostal to families. For singles/ backpackers maybe yes. But again at €100 a night it is just too expensive and for a room which does not even have a table!I've done a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor if you see my profile, and I've mostly given 4 or 5 star ratings to even 1-star hotels because of the value they give. But Martinval has to get 1-star rating only. The rooms are just ridiculously tiny. They need to drop the price by 40% to come to fair value.","May 24, 2019","23    Hostal Martinval

The staff in general were very helpful and lent us an iron and an adapter plug when we needed one. They also have a safe to store important items such as passports in.The location of the hostal was perfect as we were around 10 minutes walk from Sagrada Familia and Passeig De Gracia which was super convenient. If you're worrying about food then that's not an issue as there's a SPAR right next door to the place where you can buy fresh watermelon, water and cakes for super cheap. I recommend going to NOSTRUM which is on the same road for breakfast/lunch as it's super cheap and tastes great. There's also an ice cream parlour directly opposite the hostal which is always a plus.The only issue that we did have however was the noise. Particularly if your room is facing the street you'll find that you can practically hear everything and anything such as litter trucks to pedestrians speaking loudly. Because of this I only recall sleeping well only once, which was a shame. The fact that we had noisy neighbours didn't help.

I emailed the Hostal before my arrival for advice on travelling from the airport and received a prompt reply listing various options. I ultimately choose to travel by train, purchasing a T-10 ticket which I found to be economical and simple (the ticket can be used for 10 journeys on the train/metro so I travelled with it to and from the airport with a couple of other metro uses too, all for 10 euros) I had booked a double room which was spacious with both a double bed, single bed, small desk, ikea wardrobe and a small balcony. A plug in electric radiator was also in the room which I appreciated as I am sensitive to the cold! The bathroom was shared with one other room and was spacious with a good shower and plenty of hot water. The building itself has a charm to it, with some nice original features. I didn't have much interaction with the staff but they seemed friendly on check in and check out.My only complaint is that it was very noisy. I am not sure who was above me, but in the evening and in the mornings there was alot of banging which sounded like children running about. I only stayed two nights and it did wake me one morning. Also when the guests in the room next door were returning at night it was very loud; heels clanging on laminate flooring and the bedroom / bathroom doors banging. Noise seems to travel through the building quite easily. I would not describe the accommodation as a hostel given that you are provided with towels, shower gel etc and there are no dorm rooms as far as I am aware. It is more of a budget hotel.I am quite particular about noise as I like a good night of sleep so I maybe would not stay here again.

The rooms are spacious and clean and also the staff is very friendly. Being a sucker of anitques I quite liked the old style lift it has.

Toilet and shower room are fine. Bed is not bad, Wifi is very good as opposed to some comments. We did nit have problems with the connections and it was fast. We cannot give an excellent ratings due to the following: walls are not soundproof so you can hear people's conversations, there is no proper climate control, there's just a vent at the top of the door and on our first night we woke up in the middle of the night perspiring because it was blowing hot air. We spoke to the staff and they did listen and on the next night there was no hot air blowing in ou room. The staff told us that he did not know what to do because some guests were complaining that it was cold and some were saying it was hot. The solution is SIMPLE, just install proper air-conditioning in every rooms where the guests have the ability to control it. ","May 11, 2016","23    Hostal Martinval

Is certainly one of the nicer hostels I've stayed in in general.Cons: The walls are thin, the first night there was a loud child next door. The beds and pillow were uncomfortable, and I didn't had a good night sleep. My main gripe is the value. The price is too high when compared with other places. We we're charged 450 euros for 4 in May. There are several two bedroom apartments a few doors down that were available and very nice for the same price.

1309,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Primavera Hostel in a private room for three nights and nearly four full days. It was a really pleasant stay. Barcelona hotels in the summer are so expensive and we found Primavera to be very reasonably priced for what you got in return: a clean and spacious environment, friendly and helpful staff, and a cute and quiet location. Do note that it is a long walk from the Gothic Quarter and El Born, so if you plan to spend most of your time in those areas it might be best to consider staying closer to them (we love to walk but it did get tiresome as we were logging about 10 miles per day including our sightseeing).

Staff were on 24/7, pleasant as well and would offer tips and recommendations if you need help.Have to say that a hostel experience was not to our taste, hence our average stay at Primavera, but we booked it due to budget constraints then. For the price, it was still quite a good value considering how expensive accommodations in Barcelona can be. No AC (fans don't reach the top bunks, so I had to use my USB-powered fan) and spotty wifi in our room also didn't help.","July 27, 2017","24    Primavera Hostel

The hostel is located quite central, and we walked around it a lot, up and down the streets - Sagrada Familia, Casa Battlo, and La Pedrera are superclose, as well as Placa de Catalunya. There are coffee shops around and it's very easy to reach the place by metro, by stopping at the Verdaguer station.

Staff was really helpful. Evy actually helped me plan a quick day-trip to some of the more touristy places. I used the remaining days of my stay to visit the non-touristy Barcelona - which btw is a lot better than the touristy part. Anyway, back to the hostel staff - they're very helpful and nice. Kitchen is clean and well equipped. Personally, I loved the music that they played in the living room. It played continuously at low volumes, so was possibly not uncomfortable for anyone. And the staff cleaned the rooms and washrooms daily. So the hostel was quite clean as well.What's not so good about the place??Two things actually. First, being a central location, the traffic noise is loud, especially in the morning. Second, I visited in July - it was often hot at night and the rooms didn't have air-conditioning. There were portable fans, but I was the upper bunk, so the fans weren't very helpful.","July 24, 2016","24    Primavera Hostel

The rooms are a bit noisy from other guests and traffic close by, so you'll want ear plugs. The shared bathrooms are cleaned frequently and well arranged so that you're almost never left waiting for the facilities you need. The bed was comfortable, and bath towels large.

1328,"This amazing hostel in Barcelona is away just enough from the 'tourist areas' to allow you peace, quiet, and local prices. Walking distance from The Sagrada Familia, you will still not notice the hordes of people usually thronging the church. I was surprised when I turned a corner and saw this huge line to enter the place (Sagrada familia, not the hostel). The other attractions- La Rambla, Place de Catalunya, etc.- are best accessed by the metro. The Verdageur metro station is very close to the hostel (within 500m), but it is initially difficult to locate the hostel. A couple of times and you should be okay. You don't need to cross the 'Diagonal', which is the main road- so don't get lost while looking for it in the first instance.The hostel itself is on the first floor, and you are given the key to the entrance & the hostel gate upon check-in. You really feel you live in Barcelona for a few days :) There are 2 kitchens, multiple bathrooms and toilets so that we were still discovering the hostel on the second day! The people are just great, and give you tons of info if you seek it. The fellow hostellers are amazing as well. Really comfortable stay. We aren't forgetting Hostel Primavera in a hurry.

When we arrived the girl on the reception desk was extremely friendly and went about pointing out on the map all the tourist areas and activities.Our room was of a good size, and had all the authentic Spanish original features of the building, including a balcony which was a great addition. We did not have a private bathroom, and shared with others in the hostel, but this wasn't an issue as they were very clean and plentiful.The hostel is located just a short walk from the Sagrada Familia and the main shopping areas of Barcelona, which meant we didn't have to use taxis or the underground system much.

The staff were nice and welcoming.However, the 6-bed dorm i stayed in did not really meet my expectations. Small room, not so clean, uncomfortable mattress and creaky bunk beds. Lack of power outlets. And no A/C but fans instead so it was really hot in the room especially at night. And there was too much noise outside (cars, buses...) to leave the window open overnight.No breakfast included!!!Overall,i'd say i paid too much money for what i got (25 euros per night).

It consisted of a big living room with sofa, armchair, coffee table, dining table and chairs as well as TV. The main bedroom had a big double bed and a spacious wardrobe, the other bedroom which we haven’t used had a single bed. The kitchen was spacious, and quite well equipped with cups, glasses, cutlery, plates few saucepans and a kettle. However, you won’t find any washing up liquid nor dishwasher tablets there. I suggest these could be provided, as well as some washing powder. There is a fridge, washing machine and a dishwasher. You also have to bring your own coffee. The bathroom was clean, too. The apartment is just a short walk from majestic Sagrada Familia. Our flat was on the first floor, so we only had a glimpse of it from our balcony. The balcony is narrow, it had a little table and 2 chairs, just enough for 2 people to sit outside. The flat faces a busy road, however when we closed the shutters in the bedroom, we slept ok. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to take some earplugs, just in case. The booking said there would be a daily housekeeping, however this didn’t happen during our four nights stay (the cleaning lady came only once and just provided some fresh towels, but nothing was cleaned).

Fairly roomy.Bad Points: We were a party of 4. The rooms have beds enough for 4, but not hot water enough, even with ""Naval"" showers. Would not recommend for more than 3.Room is an apartment, but without much supplies, especially in the kitchen.Service was simply not good. We missed room clean up one day because we were in the room at the moment it was to be cleaned. Later told that they simply skip the room if we haven't made arrangements before. Well, we would have, had anyone thought to inform us of this policy. Came home after a day around the city to no toilet paper and a pile of dirty towels. The front desk gave us towels, told us we'd have to buy our own toilet paper at the nearby store. Hospitality, indeed.Except for the beginning and end of the encounter, the front desk was just surly. It's not that hard to speak to a customer who has a request, like when the Wi-Fi code changed.We won't be back.","May 29, 2017","25    Apartaments Marina

Inside there were very good size bedrooms and living room, the kitchen had all the needed dishes inside the dishwasher. There was no washer but did not need it either. The wifi is a bit slow but OK for checking fb and whatsapp. The reception staff was very happy to keep my luggage for a few hours after check out and gave me stickers for collection.

1365,"This is a true apartment with 5 rooms-2 bedrooms, one with a king bed and one with a twin bed (where we put our luggage), a kitchenette, a living/dining room, and a bathroom. It was very spacious and comfortable, and we got a great price on tripadvisor through Agoda. The location is great-2-3 blocks from the Sagrada Familia and a 20 minute walk to La Rambla. The downsides are the WiFi-it literally took me 20 minutes to get my Samsung phone connected to it, repeatedly entering the password. My husband's iPhone and our MacBook Air connected after entering the password 5-10 times. Once connected, it only took a couple of times entering the password whenever we had to reconnect. Noisy-our room faced the street, which is a pretty busy street, even late into the night.","May 9, 2017","25    Apartaments Marina

Good things - it is very central to Sagrada Familia and other attractions. It was well decorated, very clean and had everything we needed. Two bedrooms with plenty of storage space, a sitting room, dining area and a kitchen (it had all you need including a dishwasher - enough to make the basics). It had maid service every day. There are supermarkets and restaurants very close by. Highly recommended. On the down side, the bathroom was small, and the views weren't great, but it feels churlish to complain when you are getting such a great deal.","April 4, 2017","25    Apartaments Marina

1369,"What a lovely apartment! It's located within a stones throw of the Sagrada Familia and conveniently within a minutes walk of the metro station. We had a two bedroom apartment which was very clean, modern and spacious. The kitchen was well equipped with a kettle, dishwasher and other mod cons - the only thing that we missed was a toaster - but we just used the grill. The bathroom was a good size and the beds were really comfortable. Rooms at the front looking on to the road could be quite noisy with traffic etc but the one at the back of the apartment was really quiet. There are window shutters in the rooms which pull down and make them pitch black and add a little extra security. The staff were really helpful and friendly. We didn't have a problem with the wifi - you just need to get a code from reception. Check in isn't until 2pm but if you arrive earlier it's not a problem as they have a place where you can store your bags in the meantime.

1370,"Excellent place right next to Sagrada Familia, 2 bedrooms, large living room and dining table, equipped kitchen and 2 balconies!! All the windows and sliding door have a built-in blinds system that can make the room pitch dark and ads security. What else can you ask for? Maybe a coffee maker in addition to the little espresso old fashion cup that I actually really enjoyed much to my surprise.Daily maid service and everyone is really pleasant and helpful. There is a great grocery store, a liquor store and a fresh fruit and veggie stand right outside the door. At the grocery store the Champagne (cava) is almost cheaper than water and pretty decent. For a non beer drinker it was awesome :)We bough a 2 day ticket to a big bus tour and used it almost like a taxi around town, the bus stop is next to Sagrada. WiFi is a little sketchy and you have to log in every time. Even bought the upgrade and it wasn't very smooth either. Wifi seems to be a problem all over Europe and in this day and age I honestly don't understand why? There is also some city open WiFi that is also very spotty. It is not a big problem, just a nuisance and not very reliable to organize the guided tours that we purchased ahead of time.And keep in mind that the official language is Catalan not spanish, it came as a big surprise to us.

1374,"4 of us youngsters reached Barcelona city on Saturday after 2 great days in Port Aventura-Salou. Our first impression of the city was a bit shocking since we were almost robbed twice on our journey from Salou to the apartment, if it wasnt for friendly locals who warned us as well as our own alertness. Although we've frequently traveled to Europe, this type of daylight robbery was a first time experience. However this was the first and last time we would face something like this. The next few days were a breeze. We reached the apartment tired and were immediately given check-in after prompt collection of City Tax. There's always atleast one staff at the reception on a shift basis since reception is open 24 hours. They are very helpful, speak English (relief since not many in Spain do) and will book a cab for you at any time if need be.We booked a 2 bedroom apartment between the four of us. The apartment was exactly as was shown on their website. As most apartments in Europe, it had two bedrooms, a hall, one bathroom and a kitchen (pretty big kitchen). It also had a cute balcony. We didn't really have a view as such, just facing few buildings like one would in a complex. Although areawise its not on the Ramblas, I rather prefer staying a little bit away from the main area, in a central yet quiet place. The apartments are right next to the Sagrada Familia, and the metro stop by the same name. This is the L5 metro line that links to Placa Catalunya with one change in 10 mins or a good 30 min walk. The Collblanc metro stop which is the one near Camp Nou is on the same line,8 stops from Sagrada, incase you plan to catch a game of FC Barcelona (We saw the Champions league game vs Celtic 7-0. Great 1st game experience). So all in all very convenient apartments. The grocery store which is exactly 1 building away is open through midnight. At check in, you get a basic slow internet speed and can increase speed for more money (We paid EUR 5 for 3 days of bonus speed, worth it).All in all, great deal for the price. I would highly recommend this over some airbnb apartment, simply coz they've got a 24 hour reception and thats always a plus point security wise.Only Downside which may be a big big point for some people but wasn't for us: The second room had twin beds, although we joined them together, the overall size of the room was really tiny. Maybe meant more for kids rather than adults. We are pretty tiny ourselves so it wasn't that big a deal-breaker. Will surely return here if we return to Barca.","September 16, 2016","25    Apartaments Marina

We were informed when we arrived that despite our email and circumstances (flight cancellation) they would be charging us for the night we did not stay there. In addition, they rented the apartment to another customer for that night, so in essence they were double paid for the apartment.

1376,"Apartments Marina was our second stop on a 19 day trip. Our first stop was in London in some VERY tiny accommodations so at first we were delighted to walk into such spacious accommodations. However, overall I would not recommend for the following reasons:1. The beds were hard/uncomfortable. Also, they provide basically 2 crisp/rough sheets for covers so it was not cozy at all. I tried to request a blanket but they don't offer them in the summer.2. The bed sheets had a bad odor, like stinky feet. We had them swapped out but they still smelled. No screens on the windows to air out the rooms and there were occasional mosquitoes so out of luck there.3. The balcony looks out to other apartment buildings. Not a big deal but no view at all except old junky apartments. We chose for the location, size and price as a place to sleep. While the price was great, next time I will pay more. Also, I think we will stay closer to the water next time as well as it turned out we did end up wanting to spend an hour or two each evening to relax/wind down and would have preferred a view.","July 20, 2016","25    Apartaments Marina

In fact one guy on the desk recommended  that I went to the shop opposite and paid to use wi-fi there !!!! The only place I  could get wifi was in the kitchen and it kept dropping off after 5 to 10 mins. ROCK HARD BEDS !!! we are not fussy when it comes to beds, but these were really hard !! We stayed there a week and after one night on the bed where I  found it difficult to sleep, I awoke next day with aches and pains in my back. Not good when you are on holiday !

1387,"Got a really good deal by booking directly with the apartment hotel. 84EUR a night/3 nights for a spacious 2 bedroom apartment. Check in was painless other than the older of the two staff did not give us the wifi details. Not a big issue since we did not need till the next morning. Great functional kitchen, good size American style 2 door fridge/freezer and good cooktop/oven, all very modern. Yes, no tea towel if you don't want to use the dishwasher. There was only two of us so we opted to wash our cups etc. and just leave every day to drip dry. Maid service was included. When we arrived the blind in the living room was crooked and when we tried to adjust the whole thing fell off on the floor. We contacted the front desk and since it was Sunday they said it would be attended to next morning. It was fixed before noon Monday morning. We also had trouble with the safe but the front desk came into our apartment to assist and reset. We found no issues with customer service especially with the younger of the two staff. He was extremely helpful. Internet was OK, again no major issues. The apartment itself is minimalist but we do not mind modern Ikea type furnishings. Location was excellent. We asked for a high floor and got it with a fabulous view of the Gaudi Sagrada Familiacathedral to the left. Lots of bakeries, small supermarkets, cafes and restaurants all walking distance. The baguettes are fantastic and so cheap. Just buy some cheese and your good to go! There are also authentic butcher shops but we did not cook too much given we were only staying 3 days. We did take the hop on off bus which the hotel helped with by giving directions and a map. This is a must if it's your first trip to Barcelona. It is a little far to Placa Catalunya where you catch the express bus to the airport but the taxi fare is not too bad. I think it was in the region of 12 Euros. We were not promised a washer dryer nor was one in the apartment. It would have been nice but not disappointed since we did not expect it. The Would we stay here again - DEFINITELY.

It is definitely a big plus!It is only couple of blocks from La Sagrada Familia and metro. And tons of restaurants and markets around. There is also a little playground behind La Sagrada Familia so my 2 young children get to play.I would definitely stay here again! The front desk personnel we met were very friendly and helpful. Great find for our stay. :)","September 2, 2014","25    Apartaments Marina

1397,"Positives: Good value. Close to Metro and La Sagrada Familia. Clean. AC works well. Quiet if apartment faces inner court.Negative: far from the center of Barcelona, approximately 15 minutes on Metro or about 45-50 minutes of fast walk.Why did I rate this apartment at only 2 stars: the administration charges about EUR 16 for a week of WiFi Internet access. There is only one corner of the apartment when we were able to get one bar of WiFi reception. It was so fragile that it was coming down to no reception at all every 30 seconds. We made requests to the administration every morning for 7 days to no avail. One time we were even told that ""everyone else has no problems with WiFi. It seems like your problem"".WiFi Access Points are commodity this days. When extra money is being charged for WiFi access, the responsible party has to make sure that there is enough APs to provide the service.","July 2, 2014","25    Apartaments Marina

There is a nice supermarket a block away which sells ready-made food and wine/beer. If you take streets about one or two streets off from the main touristic streets, you can see the cute little cafes and bars locals go to. Somehow I got a two room unit with a balcony. The master bedroom, a single room, a well equipped kitchen, a bathroom with a tub and living room are spacious and clean. This place is perfect for a family with children. They can buy food and cook simple meals.The staff jus gives you a key.You cannot expect more than that. They also take care of the garage so most of times they are busy tending the garage customers.

1402,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights in early December. Travelling with just cabin baggage, these apartments are probably not ideal, as they are very large with surplus storage space, but lack some essentials such as tea-towels, basic cleaning materials, etc. Our apartment was also not very clean, particularly sinks, work surfaces, and the marble effect floors, and the maid service seemed rather limited. Set against these negative points are the amount of space, the extremely convenient location just 2 mins walk from La Sagrada Familia and the adjacent metro station, the wide balcony with its view over to the towers of this stunning piece of Modernista architecture, floodlit at night, the wider location in the architecturally significant Eixample of the city,, the help afforded by the 24 hour reception staff, and, most significantly for those travelling on a budget, the price.

1408,"First impression was of a reasonable hostel/hotel in a quite run down area.I was told that the hotel sits in the more residential part of Barcelona and therefore it is quiet. It certainly was quiet, but the smell out on the Rue Diagonal was really pungent when walking around.The smell in the room matched the odour on the street, with a distinct perfume of damp washing that had been left in the washing machine for days.The rooms are sparse, but for the money you pay I guess you get what you pay for.No tea or coffee facilities at all and not enough room to swing a small mouse let alone a cat!Thank goodness this was only a very short stay. If you're looking for a place to spend no time in apart from to sleep, and you have a bunged up nose or generally haven't a strong sense of smell, this place will be ideal for you.

The hotel room was perfect, had a very comfortable bed, very good AC, good showers, also the rooms were very clean, the only negative thing was that the room walls were a little bit dirty (the ceiling had dirty footprint marks). The location is perfect, quite and you can get to the city centre in 10-15 minutes, the beach is like 5-10 minutes with walking. The staff was fantastic, we brought in a lot of sand to our rooms and by the next day, our room was always very clean (thank you, and sorry for that), the reception was also fantastic, Anna and Sandra helped us a lot to make our stay perfect (also thank you for the other receptionists as well). Barcelona is a great city, with a great beach and has a great feeling of freedom and peace, it is also very easy to find everything with google maps and the public transportation system is quite simple, or only the ticket system is a little bit strange.

The room was perfectly clean, the bed was completely comfortable, and the shower was wet.The name Best Price is wholly correct in the case of this hotel, as it does lie at the lower end of that scale; the value in this increases when one counts in the brilliantly friendly and helpful staff, which are exactly what you want in the morning.Location-wise, it lies all of 800 yards from the north-east end of the beaches; around 150 yards from the Selva de Mar Metro stop (which runs straight to the city centre in less than 15mins) and within a short walk of the Poble Nou ramblas which has all the restaurants/eateries one could need.It's been said once, but it needs saying again - the staff here are brilliant.I intend to return.","October 11, 2016","26    Hotel Best Price Diagonal

The beach is about a 10 minute walk, there is a huge shopping centre around a 5 minute walk away and the metro is literally across the road.Very accessible to all parts of Barcelona and in a quieter area so there is very few tourists in this area.I did not rate highly the breakfast at the cafe beside the hotel so we went for the baguettes and such in the supermarket in the shopping centre instead where the food is incredibly cheap.This part of Barcelona is great for the beach too as although busy it is not half as busy as near the touristy parts where you cannot see a clear piece of sand!Also special thanks to Ana at reception who was very helpful for information on everything!","August 11, 2016","26    Hotel Best Price Diagonal

We were told it was not noisy which proved incorrect. We had little sleep between the receptionist coughing, people talking and shouting in reception and the noise of trolley bags being run past our door. I have little doubt the other rooms would be satisfactory for the price as they had comfortable beds and were well appointed. The rooms on reception should be heavily discounted and the reason why explained and then people at least have a choice. I made my view known to the receptionist who offered nothing but an assurance she would take my views to the manager.

1445,"I'll start with the few things I liked:- Bed is SUPER comfortable. I've never felt so good on a bed, and it's a king size (for a double room). - Room is modern and cosy, forniture quite new (although the shower had one rail half-broken. nothing major.) You also get a desk and one chair. Safe-deposit box is €1 a day. Now the things I didn't like:- The room is noisy even during the night. I've spent 4 nights here and every night I could hear some sort of buzzes coming from outside my room (I guessed they were phones of other people in other rooms that were reciving notifications? Still not acceptable and quite hard to think this scenario could be true EVERY night).If your room has the window to the street, it might be nosiy in the morning as well (as in my case).- No shampoo in the shower. Not even the basic one they usually give you in a 3 stars B&B. There was only a body wash soap which also destroied my hair in just 4 days.- Poor Internet signal (at least on the first floor where I was). Very slow, good just for small browsing, but not for work or anything similar.- Fake TV - you can only play radio on it.- You have to pay extra to change your towels.","March 22, 2016","26    Hotel Best Price Diagonal

They even borrowed us an umbrella when it rained. We had a room with 2 separate beds. Unfortunately, there is no view outside, only onto an inside garden or at plants. The beds were good, the bathroom was very small. There is a blowdryer and showercream. There is no noise from the outside (traffic e.g.), however, if other people close their door, it awakens you.At the reception you can buy a voucher for a good breakfast at the bakery on the same square. There is a vending machine in the lobby with coffee, beverages and sweets.

You had to pay extra for the towels to be changed, extra for the safe, for water, and a small bottle of it was 1 Euro. At the Hyperstore, you could get 1.5 litres for 35 cents. Note, the dining area is not even in the hotel: its a cafe 2 minutes walk away. Huh?? The breakfast was included in the base price but still, 237 Euro for 3 nights and the food is a dry baguette with salami, coffee and juice? Dry sandwich means that, a slight spread plus a slice or 2 of salami. How much are tomatoes, onions, cheese, eggs??? Wow! For 7.95 you could get a NY Burger Meal at Pollo Campero inside Diagonal Mall, which I recommend by the way.Front line stuff were amazing but paying extra for amenities put me right off.","September 17, 2015","26    Hotel Best Price Diagonal

1452,"We stayed in the BestPrice Diagonal hotel for 5 nights. It is situated close to the Selva de Mar metro station and there is also a tram station nearby. If you are planning to travel by metro, bear in mind that it is really wet and warm in the underground corridors in summer, although all the public transport is equipped with air-conditioning. The hotel rooms are all very small: there is only a bed, a TV, a wardrobe with some hangers, 2 shelves, a small table and a chair. There is also a mirror and a hairdryer in the shower. The room window is not transparent at all (I think it is due to the fact that all the rooms are situated on the ground floor), but it opens, so you can have some fresh air if you don't like air conditioning. The cleaning of the rooms takes place every day, but the towels are only changed if you pay 3€ per person. You can buy coffee and some snacks for 1€ at the reception. The water is potable, but if you prefer bottled water you can also buy it for 1€. There are a lot of flyers at the reception, you can use them, some of them will provide you with discounts. The hotel theoretically offers a transfer to the airport for 37€ (taxi is 41€), but it was not available when we asked for it (it is also possible to get there by metro and by train, the hotel will send you the instructions by email). Neither was the massage. Nevertheless the staff members are mostly nice and smiling. There is a shopping mall with different restaurants nearby, the beach is 15 minutes walk. It is very good for a 1-star hotel, just don't expect too much from it and you will enjoy :)","August 21, 2015","26    Hotel Best Price Diagonal

1453,"Wonderful hotel and great personnel at the desk.Location: Very well balanced location. 12 minutes walk to the beach. 5 minutes walk to the subway and 10 minutes ride to the heart of the city. You have everything around you that could come in handy. Small private supermarkets, megamarket at the nearby mall (8 minutes walk), bakery, flower shop (for the romantics in us), etc. Around 37-43 euro for taxi to drop you off at the hotel from the El prat airport. The same for getting you to the airport. Around 12 euro for the taxi to get you from Placa Catalunya to the hotel.The tourist bus has a stop at 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Comfort: Bed is a pleasure to sleep in and pillows are great. The room and hallways have a chic feel to them. Room is a little bit on the small side but we were only in our room to sleep. So no harm done there for us. Bathroom/toilet is badly aired. Shower steam and toilet odour remains in the room for too long.Hygiene: The cleaning service cleans the room very well. It is a shame though that you have to pay for the towels to be changed (it's because of the environment, they say) . I understand that you don't change your towels on a daily basis when you're at home. But when you go to a hotel, you expect them to change them.Reception/desk: Very helpful and friendly service is given to you from start to end. They are honest and really want to help you out. Whether it is tourist information or printing your e-ticket for the flight back. They are there to help and inform. For 3 euro per person it's possible to rent beach towels. Conclusion: Very well thought out hotel with great personnel and localisation. You won't be sorry you stayed here. There are things the hotel can work on to improve. Price quality wise it was a treat for us. We will be definitely staying here again when we come back to Barcelona. We do hope the towel changing policy and the airing of the bathroom/toilet gets better.","August 6, 2015","26    Hotel Best Price Diagonal

1454,"This was our first time in Barcelona and aside from the fact that the city is beautiful, our vacation was made significantly better because of this hotel.The location is in a fairly quiet area and the Metro is only around 2-3 minutes away by walk. Most places are relatively easy to get to from this hotel which obviously adds to the overall experience. In terms of pricing, I would say that it is very fairly priced. As for the rooms, it was pleasant and refreshing to see that even though it is a 1 star hotel, the rooms were very clean and very reasonably sized.Overall, we only encountered a small issue on the first day with the safe not functioning properly but that was very quickly amended the following day.One final note, I would especially like to thank one of the staff members of the hotel, Gustavo as he simply made our stay so much better. He helped us so much with any questions we had in general about either the city itself or any other queries we had in general. This person in question simply made our stay so much better.

The kids could only take so much 'culture' in town so the short 10 minute walk to the beach each evening, importantly bypassing the busy moterway via a bridge, was their highlight of each day and it felt refreshing to get away from the busy city. The beach had showers and a climbing frame too. A shopping centre with large supermarket is 3 mins walk away and great for cheap eats or food on the go. The tube is also very close and is on the yellow L3 line which takes you straight to most of the major attractions in the city centre. SO good choice for all but particularly families.

1456,"This was the second year in a row for me to stay here. The conference centre is a about 10 minutes away as well as the shopping centre. The nearest tube station, Selva de Mar, is only a minute away and the ""yellow line"" takes you to downtown a few minutes. A brisk ten minute walk takes you to the nearest beach. The new hotspot of hip restaurants and other small businesses in Barcelona, Poblenou, is ten blocks away. Forget the hipster apocalypse that is Gracia and head to Poblenou, you will not regret it. Service is superb. It is really personal and caring. Note that this is not the kind of ""a stick up your bottom"" and a pretentious yankee smile kind of service. These people really care about their customers. The rooms are modern, clean, and the hotel is really, really quiet. Aircon works perfectly and you can set the temperature to your taste. The beds (and pillows!) are really good. I know that this is a personal subjection, but to me, just perfect. The ""Feng Shui"" is really strong and potent in the rooms and in public areas of the hotel. The led based lighting (which changes colour in the night) really adds to the nice atmosphere. The interior design is really timeless with clean surfaces and small accents. There are no trendy gimmicks in play here. The free WiFi works really well and there is a computer for the guests to use in the lobby. There is a small grocery store, a hardware store (in case you need a hammer or a screwdriver), a pharmacist, a fishmonger, a beauty salon, a bakery and a tobacco shop next door.

The breakfast was good, with orange juice, coffee, water, 2 types of bread, ham, cheese, yogurt, muffins, fruits and small cakes.

The rooms are quite small, but the big advantage for such a small hostal is the private bathroom in every room. We rented both a room and the apartment at the top floor. The apartment has a bit more space than the rooms and has a fully equipped kitchen (and access to a roof terrace) and a TV (spanish channels). However the free wifi is not working up there, but you can use it in the common room downstairs. Cleaning was very good and breakfast (included in the price!) was more than sufficient to start the day. Air condition worked well. A bit limited hot water for showering because of the size of the tank)The location of Nisia is perfect. Gracia is close to many of the attractions of Barcelona, but is like a small town in the town. Lots of small restaurants (many of them of good quality and better prices than in the most tourist infected areas), shops of all kinds and and it's own food market. To bring home some good meat: The family butcher shop in the corner of Reial de la Vila de Gracia (150 metres behind Nisia) is recommended. Great service and high quality. The Nisia is situated in the main street Gran de Gracia which at day time is quite busy. The sleeping rooms is at the back of the house so there is no noise problem (the back side is the lack of a good view). The breakfast room is facing the main street however - with a tiny balcony - very nice). Quite a steep and narrow entrance from the street door to Nisia (especially to the apartment on the top, but no problem if you are not disabled or if you try to carry more than one suite case at a time...).All in all: Absolutely recommended if you don't want to pay for luxury but prefer to stay in a homely atmosphere in a villagelike part of the town, share the breakfast table with other nice people and enjoy the personal touch and amiable service from the hosts. And you will be happy to stay well away from the chaotic and more and more dodgy Ramblas.","October 22, 2015","27    Nisia Bed & Breakfast

1467,"We thought this place was a real ""winner"". Laura and Paolo are excellent hosts.. There is a lovely communal area looking out over the street - we'd been on the road for 2 weeks staying mostly in conventional hotels and especially appreciated having a comfortable communal area we could relax in and make a cup of tea etc when we needed. The room we were in was quiet, with a very comfortable bed, and large opening windows. Wifi was excellent. The breakfasts were very good and Laura has gone out of her way to try to cater for all tastes. As others have said, you need to be aware that the BandB is up two flights of narrow stairs, the toilet cubicle and shower are small, and the shower and basin are in an open area in the room - none of that worried us, but it wouldn't suit everyone. The location is wonderful - the friend we were visiting recommended we stay in his neighbourhood and what a wonderful place to stay - lots of character, plenty of places to eat and placa to sit in and watch the world go by, and within walking/metro/bus distance of all the attractions. All in all, tremendous value and we hope we can return one day. Thanks Laura and Paolo!","October 20, 2015","27    Nisia Bed & Breakfast

1468,"I stayed here for 7 days with my girlfriend. The place is very close to public transportations and in 15 minutes you can reach every spot in the city. If you like walking, Sagrada Familia is 25 minutes away as Picasso museum and the Ramblas. The place is not huge, they have a nice little apartment on the roof and some bedrooms (with bathroom) on the 2nd floor, I have tried both and I can say that they are clean and comfortable. The breakfast is good and the owners speak 4 languages Italian, Spanish, English and German. They are also really kind.","August 4, 2015","27    Nisia Bed & Breakfast

1470,"This B&B is a great option if you want a good location but you're on a bit of a budget. Laura was always very quick to respond to any emails and questions we had before we arrived to the B&B. We had a little bit of trouble finding it once we got off the metro, it's a good thing we had Spanish SIM cards in our phones. There's no sign or anything outside of the building or on the callbox so we walked by it a few times before we figured it out. We got in kind of late at night, somewhere around 11pm or so arriving from San Sebastian. Laura was waiting for us when we got there (I'm not sure if they live on site, I usually only saw them there in the morning and when she greeted us). The kitchen/common area is really nicely decorated, I liked it a lot. We stayed in the room at the end of the hall on the left (""T"" I think?). The room was nice and the bed was reasonably comfy. The hot water thing doesn't bother me, they have a notice on the wall that explains it really well - each room has its own dedicated hot water tank. I don't expect them to put the huge tanks like we have at home here in Canada in a tiny little room in Europe (I have been known to regularly shower for more than half an hour with very hot water). I just turned the water off when I wasn't using it and then turned it back on to rinse and had no problem. I've been to other places that have restrictions on their water usage as well so I didn't mind. There's a nice big closet area to hang up your clothes/put your suitcases also, though the layout of the room was kind of odd, even for Europe. When you come into the room, the bathroom is in one big sort of open area with a little water closet for the toilet with a folding pocket door. The sink is out in the open and the shower is a stall, also sort of out in the open. The bed is in its own kind of closed off area (an archway leads into it), but the vent for the A/C is out in the bathroom area so it doesn't really get to the bedroom very well. We work in residential construction at home, so I assumed the strange design was due to the fact the B&B appeared to be a flat that was converted to a B&B later on, and the ducting for A/C and the waterlines were in wonky spots. Due to the design, the room got very hot at night since the A/C never seemed to reach us. That's the only reason I'm taking off one star, because I have trouble sleeping if its too warm (too warm for me is anything over 22 degrees Celsius, I think it was 27 degrees in the room which is pretty hot).The location is within easy walking distance to La Rambla, and the district the B&B itself is in is very nice. The metro is a few minutes walk away as well. In the block around the hotel there were a lot of nice boutiques, but we were always walking by too early or too late to visit them. There's also plenty of nice coffee shops and bakeries, as well as two decent sized convenience stores up the road should you need anything. We had to get some laundry done while we were there, Laura and Paolo helped us find a place a couple streets over. I can't remember the name of the place, but it's very small and had two Spanish ladies working inside. I think it was actually marked as a drycleaner's. I'm not sure if we would have figured it out without knowing Spanish. There's another one close by that's run by a nice Chinese man, but he only does commercial loads. We stayed here for a few nights. It's actually pretty quiet at night, but we did have to leave the window open a couple times during the night due to the heat. If you get the same room as we had, you'll be treated to a nice view of the neighbor's beautiful rooftop garden (very pretty when they had it all lit up at night). I slept well for the most part, and I would still recommend this B&B when visiting Barcelona.","November 20, 2014","27    Nisia Bed & Breakfast

We were a little unsure about the location when we booked it, but absolutely lucked out. It's in Gracia, a beautiful neighborhood with great architecture and restaurants and bars and without the hordes of tourists, just a few blocks to Eixample, and then Las Ramblas, El Born, etc. We were able to walk everywhere, and the trip to / from the main train station was super easy by Metro.

We had a beautiful air conditioned clean room with a private bathroom. We slept very well. The B&B has 3 bedrooms, a beautiful kitchen and a cosy living room. Wifi is included in the price and works well. The location is ideal since it is directly on Carrer de Gracia, the main street of Barcelona with all the shopping stores. We were 15 minutes (by walk) away from the center (touristic) of Barcelona but just minutes away from the more local part of Barcelona (no tourists !!), where we had the chance to try amazing cheap meals. There are many pickpockets in Barcelona and we felt very secure at Nisia B&B. The apartment is on the 3rd floor, so we felt very at ease leaving our private belongings in the room all day.

1485,"Thank you to the TA reviewers who helped me choose this B&B. It is perfect for a stay in Barcelona, and Alex and Carina are such friendly and helpful hosts. Nisia is on a busy avenue, but the rooms are double-glazed, and certainly my room which was at the back, was very quiet. There were plenty of clothes hangers and a low shelf which you could store luggage under, and a higher shelf for lighter luggage.Breakfast is cereal, kiwi and yoghurt, with meats, cheese and bread/toast and jam/marmalade with tea/coffee. I found it plenty, and didn't need to eat till late afternoon. It was nice to meet and sit with the other guests each morning, to share our experiences of the city.There is a fridge and use of microwave and kettle anytime. The lounge is large and comfortable with a TV, DVD player and plenty of travel guides.It is a 20 minute walk from Placa de Catalunya, but only 5 -10 minutes from either Fontana or Diagonal metro stops; although Fontana is slightly farther, it is downhill from there, if you have a lot of luggage. Nisia is next door to the tapas bar, and directly opposite DIR. It does have a very narrow entrance and stairs, but Carina and Alex helped me up and down with my luggage.Nisia is on the same road as La Pedrera and Casa Battlo, which are also both near metro stops. La Sagrada is probably a 20 minute walk, but also at a metro. So you have all the benefits of staying in a great city, without being in the busy centre, and it's like being in a home away from home.

1486,"Traveling alone for my first trip to Europe I was pleased to read the reviews of Nisia Bed and Breakfast on tripadvisor and booked part of my stay with Alex and Carina. Nisia looks exactly like the pictures show, large community living room with dining area and kitchen, bedroom with ensuite bath. The location was excellent, many local shops nearby, close to 2 stops on the green metro line and a tourist information office (TI).  After some miscommunication with my son, I followed the directions given for public transportation from the airport to Nisia and found it no problem (I do not speak Spanish) and did not have a phone. Carina graciously let me leave my bag there (I had arrived early) while I walked to my son's apartment. The local area (off the main street) is quiet, quaint, with neighborhood plazas and all around there was superb architecture to stroll and see. There are many small shops and restaurants nearby. I always felt very safe in the Gracia area and in Barcelona and spent my days sightseeing by myself while my son was in class. Alex and Carina had some very useful books and offered the use of their computer to research or to print admission tickets. The free WIFI worked great! The breakfast serve each morning was very filling and I often did not even think about food until mid afternoon. I enjoyed visiting with Alex and Carina in the mornings and with the other guests (a couple from France, we overlapped 1 day, and a family from England, sharing the apartment for 3 days). It was fun exchanging tourist information each day on what we had visited or done and how we got there. Alex and Carina always had suggestions and advice which was helpful. The bedrooms are located in the back of the flat so they are not right on the street (much quieter). It is on the second floor with no elevator, if that is an issue for someone (the stairs are steep) - not a problem for me. This has got to be one of the best values in Barcelona and I am afraid it will not be kept secret for too long with all the awesome reviews it gets! I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Nisia and would not hesitate to stay there again if I am ever lucky enough to come back to Barcelona.

The simple but sufficient breakfast was served every morning from 8.30 to 9.30 (working days) and it carried us well until lunchtime.We didn't use the facilities of the common room very much since the weather was superb and we were out exploring and enjoying the city, but there are lots of options in the common room as well. There are books and games, a tv and a stereo. Also the free wifi is excellent.The location is good along the metro L3 (green line), about halfway between the stops Fontana and Diagonal.

1496,"Overall, we loved our stay at Nisia. Carina and Alex were very welcoming, and we felt like we were at home. The room was small, but perfect for a busy stay in Bcn. Clean, comfortable bed, very quiet. The location is phenomenal. We walked EVERYwhere from Nisia. It's super central, close to the metro but also to Passeig de Gracia. The street where Nisia is is also great with some architectural gems. There is a supermarket downstairs for water, fruits, etc. We loved the breakfast with the other guests (2 other rooms) - it was a great time discussing our trips and countries with them. Carina and Alex have great recommendations for food. There are tons of great food options closeby. The price was great for Bcn. No problem with anything (ac working as we wanted, shower had enough water etc.). The only downside is the small size of the rooms but for the price, that's not a problem at all! Definitely recommend this little gem!","September 19, 2012","27    Nisia Bed & Breakfast

1499,"Although at first we had a little trouble finding Nisii (note the little sticker on the intercom, it is hard to notice!!!) choosing this B & B was a hit. At the beginning of our holiday Alex gave us a map of Barcelona, told what is worth to see and pointed corresponding points (the map was very helpful helpful during all trips), and in the following days, always willing to answer any questions or concerns. The second part of this amazing duo was Carina - just nice, helpful and in addition preparing a delicious breakfast ;)Nisia B&B has a very good location - near the metro and one of the most luxurious streets of Barcelona. The apartment has a common room and kitchen (you can use the dishes and refrigerators), and several comfortable and nicely furnished rooms with air conditioning. In the morning Alex or Carina preparing breakfast (delicious and very filling), and is highly recommended especially amazing coffee;)In Nisia you can also meet interesting people from around the world (and talking with them during breakfast)...

1501,"I agree that both Alex and Carina are wonderful and very helpful. They provided us with recomendations on where to eat, and what to see. Our son has gone to live there so we picked this accommodation because it was around the corner from his apartment. We have been to Barcelona before but stayed in a business hotel near the station. Although it was very posh, it lacked both atmosphere and wasnt near the real family areas of the city.We were not disappointed with either the accommondation or location of Nisia. The communal room was very nice and our bedroom (which was at the rear of the accommodation) was very quiet. The air con was excellent for us, as the temp went up to 32 c whilst we were there, but the nights were very cool. I cannot comment on the other rooms but ours was great.The breakfasts were great with a good variety of things to eat. Alex's coffee is fab!The location is very convenient for both the metro and for the various squares in the area.I do suggest however, that it is made very clear that if you had a mobility problem you would find it very difficult to get up the very narrow staircase. The staircase is very tatty, and gives the wrong first impression, as the apartment is clean, and very modern. Don't be put off by it!The only suggestion I would make, is that a larger sign is placed near to the front door. It took us several walk passes to actually realise that the apartment was behind the very small door, and the name on the bell wasnt very large and could have been easily missed.Regarding the rough towels, I find this a hard one (sorry about the pun!.) Without the use of a tumble drier they will always be stiff. However, I recommend you see them as having an exfoliating experience which is very good for your skin, and cost a lot of money in England!!!We are going back to Nisia in October and would gladly recommend it to anyone.","July 10, 2012","27    Nisia Bed & Breakfast

1502,"I agree with all reviewers here that the hosts Alex and Carina are wonderful and very helpful. The property is located very close to the metro in a nice location and the breakfast is decent with cereal, fruit, pastries, ham & cheese, bread and coffee. The rooms are very clean although very small. We reached at the property at around 10 pm and Alex let us in. He gave us a tour of the B&B and also explained us about Barcelona touristic sites and how to remain safe within the city. However, we decided to move from the B&B in the morning. We spent a very sleepless night - the beds and pillows are very uncomfortable and the air conditioning was virtually non-existent (the a/c is set at 24C which we found to be quite hot for us,esp since it was 21C outside). We also agree with a previous reviewer that the towels are extremely scratchy. Also, there is only a limited amount of water supply for showers which we didn't know about before we went there (we didn't actually take a shower). We met Carina in the morning and she was very understanding about us leaving abruptly since we were uncomfortable and nothing could really be done about it. All in all its mostly a hostel level accommodation which might be okay for the price, but we did get a 4* hotel on Las Ramblas for not significantly higher than the rates at Nisia.","June 10, 2012","27    Nisia Bed & Breakfast

1503,"I echo all of the reviews that talk about the fantastic location. Nisia is very close walking distance to the subway, which will take you anywhere in the city, and Placa de Cataluyna is only about 15 minutes away by foot. As others have said, the bed and breakfast is not fancy, but it was very comfortable and clean, and it served my needs perfectly for my five days in Barcelona. Alex and Carrina are charming hosts, and I really appreciated that on two days when I had to leave early to take tours outside of the city that they had a place set for me at the table in the morning along with access to all of the food that I needed. They could not have been more accommodating. The Gracia neighborhood is extremely charming with many outdoor places to eat within the several nearby plazas. I would caution potential travelers about two things. First, there is a bit of street noise, especially on the weekends. It didn't keep me from sleeping, but I did use ear plugs a couple of times. Second, as others have commented, the establishment is two floors above the street with no elevator access. The staircase is very narrow. It didn't cause any problems for me, but it certainly could be an issue for anyone with limited mobility. I encourage anyone to check out check Nisia who is looking for comfortable accommodations at a reasonable price in a perfect location.","June 1, 2012","27    Nisia Bed & Breakfast

From there it was an easy stroll to good food, la Rambla and Gaudi sites. The best part was the hospitality.

1513,"I made a reservation with Guesthouse Gotic last week through Agoda, which is the same platform as Booking dot com. According to the booking a EUR payment was to be collected by the property as a non-refundable pre-payment. I paid online by credit card.During the night after I made my booking my credit card was charged in GBP for a different amount than the contractually agreed EUR amount. The property only has a minimalist webpage with only a phone number and no email address to contact. I tried to contact them via Agoda customer service, which is a hellish experience and called them to have the charge reversed, or a written confirmation that this is only supposed to be a pre-authorization, which will be reversed once I pay in EUR at the property.Via phone they lied to me and claimed that they had not charged my credit card, which was a blatant lie since I had my credit card statement in front of me.Via Agoda support they eventually acknowledged that they indeed charged my card with a fraudulent amount but both Agoda and the property exhibited an utter incompetence in getting the issue resolved.After several days back and forth via Agoda automated support system and several phone calls to the property, my booking was eventually cancelled without my consent and the fraudulent amount PARTIALLY refunded by the property. I made a loss since they probably refunded the fraudulent GBP amount and not the actual EUR amount.This cost me a substantial amount of time and nerves and is due to corrupt business practices and utter incompetence, STAY AWAY!","April 15, 2019","28    Guesthouse Barcelona Gotic

The service was excellent.The location is ideal. From the guesthouse the walking time to places such as La Rambla, Barceloneta, La Catedral and Ciutadella is very easy (anything from 5 minutes to 15 minutes). There are some wonderful bars and restaurants within a stones throw of the guesthouse (Bar Celta Pulperia and Colom Restaurant were two of our favourites - both less than 5 minutes walk from the guesthouse).The only slight difficulty we had was controlling the temperature in our room (we were in Barcelona during a reasonably hot weekend). There was a large fan provided, but the fan wasn't very effective. Nonetheless, the shower water temperature could be turned down cold if desired and the large balcony-style doors both proved helpful in mitigating this.

1532,"the location of the guesthouse is ideal if you want to be centrally based - its a 5 minute walk to las Ramblas, 10 minutes to the beach and from the metro stations nearby you can get to all the major attractions. The room we were given was better than we expected - the room was cleaned daily and fresh towels provided when used. although you could hear people in the street outside in the evening (if the balcony doors were open..) it was not excessive and quiet by the time we went to sleep. the staff were very friendly and helpful when needed. we didn't have breakfast at the guesthouse so cannot comment on that. the restaurants and bars nearby were excellent and there were lots of shops and markets within strolling distance. we would definately stay again, in fact we were already considering coming back with our children very soon. For the price, location and value I can't see how any other hostel or hotel could come close.","March 2, 2017","28    Guesthouse Barcelona Gotic

1534,"We had a lovely stay at the Barcelona Gotic. The location was perfect for exploring Barri Gotic..and feeling immersed in this unique part of Barcelona. The room was spotless and the cleaning staff were excellent..it was so nice to have a cleaned room everyday with fresh towels and refilled soaps. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was modern. We had a balcony which was nice (although a little smaller than we had hoped). The staff are very helpful and friendly. It is very relaxed..you can come and go as you please as the desk is 24 hours. It is excellent value for the price. Just be aware of the extras - wi fi in the room, (it is free in the communal area), the room safe is 1 euro per day and breakfast is 3 euros per day per person. We would definitely stay again ..hopefully later this year !! Thanks Barcelona Gotic! ","February 16, 2017","28    Guesthouse Barcelona Gotic

1535,"Stayed here for three nights. We chose it for the location and price. It was really hard to beat. I'll start with the positives. Clean room and our shared bathroom was V clean. Rooms got cleaned daily. Breakfast was pretty good for a continental in a hostel. Staff were pleasant. Location is superb. The Gothic quarter is somewhere that is perfect for tourists. As central as can be. Some nice bars and cafes nearby alongside cheap supermarkets. Ok now for the cons. Obviously when paying a low price there will be trade offs. Walls were thin. Thin enough that we could hear the people in the room next door whispering. Not an exaggeration. I'm a heavy sleeper though so it didn't bother me too much. Security was a major turn off. Had I realised before how security worked there I would not have went for it. So you get a key for your room. You have to give the key into reception when leaving the hostel and ask for it back when returning. Seems like a very insecure method as there was no verification required for collecting a key. We were also handed the key to the room beside us on one occasion. There were no safes in our room to add to this so we really did not feel like our things were secure in our room. If you want to use a locker it is €2. I probably wouldn't book again mainly due to my thoughts on their security. Also they have emailed me that they are having a competition for leaving review. The prize is a mini iPad. To quote the email ""But remember… participate will be possible as long as the person has stayed here and can appreciate her o his experience publicly."" Incentivised reviews are often misleading. I'd recommend this place if your on a budget but don't leave your valuables in your room. ","February 6, 2017","28    Guesthouse Barcelona Gotic

I walked past it about 4 times before stopping locals to ask for help. Press the bell and the door opens so then to make my way upstairs to the reception. I was greeted by a man and woman who were nice enough, he did say when you leave the hotel leave my key with him.8 am I woke up and left the hotel to meet someone, no one was at reception so I just nipped downstairs, it wasn't an issue because I was only a few minutes!Only to find, that upon my return with my friend and I was to be greeted by this vicious woman who was very upset I had left the hotel with the key, this is the key which was in my hand that I opened the door with, the last thing I thought about was keeping her happy and pressing the bell to give her the room key...She was not impressed! In fact her attitude was shocking! She was refusing my friend into my room. Whilst I packed my case because he wasn't a guest, she told him to sit in reception and be quiet!?!? She then continued to follow him telling him to be quiet, his repbecause your the one making me talk...To be honest I wouldn't stay at this hotel ever again and certainly would NOT recommend staying here... This woman who claims to be the manager is a horrible woman who is rude and quite honestly Nasty!Oh did I mention that someone has wiped the nose up the wall in a little shelf set into the wall and I had to sleep next to that...Pay a little more and stay some where which will show you a little more respect as a paying customer. The actual hotel was not bad, clean bathroom and communal areas, the room was alright for the price paid.Ypu do get what you pay for so I can't really moan about that.After I wrote the above the actual hotel manager has been emailing asking for details and in his and the hotels defence he seems to be talking time to look into this with some seriousness, so for those wishing to book then maybe give it a go and you will receive a better experience than myself.

1574,"Neat little hotel that offers a great location within walking distance of many Barcelona attractions and is one minute from a Metro stop. We upgraded to the bigger double room which was definitely worth the extra 12 Euros a night. Lovely high-ceilinged cool room with good shower and toilet provided all the space we needed. The hotel doesn't provide food but does serve free coffee and tea every morning in the garden area, which was very pleasant, until noon. There are a choice of bakeries 1 minute away around the corner. Staff were friendly and helpful and spoke excellent english. We will come again. Many thanks","August 18, 2019","29    Praktik Garden

The sink was in the room and toilet and shower were behind thin glass door that wasn't completely sealed (a little too much lol). Also there was no closet for clothes and not enough space to keep our suitcases open. We felt like we have paid too much for what it was and we felt like we were in a fancy hostel.

1579,"I absolutely adore this hotel!  I first came across this hotel from a blog post of travel writer. At first I was taken by the concept of a theme hotel. Praktik Garden is a hotel that centers around the theme of a garden. On the property are two adjacent outdoor garden sitting areas that guests are able to enjoy. I was traveling with my sister and her family (who were booked in another room) and we were able to spend time each other in the lovely garden space. This was much more enjoyable than being inside a hotel room.Not that the rooms weren't comfortable, far from that. The rooms were perfect and were stylish and modern yet not excessive. I had a balcony that opened onto Barcelona, a private bathroom, an area to store my belongings. The bed was King size, firm, and very comfortable. The hotel decor was quirky and hip. Location excellent. There is a metro stop just around the corner.The hotel staff was very helpful in directions and were also able to help be book tickets to Park Guell for the next day. My own search came up with the day being sold out.To top things off, the room was so affordable. Great value.","July 16, 2019","29    Praktik Garden

No tea/coffee/fridge in room, lack of overall storage for clothesAlthough square footage in total seems large, room is divided into two ‘spaces’. The second area overlooking the patio (although masked by foliage) is separate, not well air conditioned and pretty much useless for anything other than storing cases.Lighting in the room and bathroom was particularly terrible. There were lots of lights in the rooms, but their position and style really became an annoyance when trying to get ready, etc.Walls were very thin and we were woken several times hearing noise outside the room. Overall we enjoyed our stay in Barcelona and found the position of the hotel very convenient. The room however did not live up entirely to our expectations and consequently we would not stay again.","July 14, 2019","29    Praktik Garden

1581,"Praktik is a great location for sightseeing and close to the city centre for shops restaurants etc. The hotel is very clean and comfortable with quirky decor and a nice terrace with lots of lush greenery. They offer free tea and coffee in the morning which is a nice touch. Having stayed in lots of hostels, I felt like it had the same hostel vibe but just an adult one!The front desk can help to answer questions and book you tickets to places like Sagrada Familia etc. However I was a little annoyed when they told us we didn’t need to book Park Guell tickets to go there and find out we couldn’t get in because we didn’t have a pre-booked ticket!!! My advice is just to book any Gaudi attraction way in advance! Although clean and comfortable, I have to admit it was quite noisy, I wouldn’t say I’m a light sleeper, but on some nights I struggled to get off to sleep! Lots of kitchen noises, could hear people showering/the noise of the water pipes, and hearing other people walking up and down the nearby stairs. Similar first thing in the morning. I would say if you were looking for just a relaxed stay where you can have a lie in-perhaps not the right place?! If your looking for somewhere to come in late and get up early to sightsee then perhaps it would be a good option for you!","July 12, 2019","29    Praktik Garden

This fit our needs. Excellent location, friendly staff, comfortable beds, fresh and fairly recently established. Our room was small—but bathroom large so it would have been good to have a stand in there for a suitcase. Our favorite part was the lounge and garden on the first floor. The expresso machine was very slow in making a cup of coffee—-everyone thought one guest was an employee as she helped several of us. She said she’d mentioned the problem the day before. Big problem? No. It’s a quirky hotel—-more quirky than I had expected.

1604," Unfortunately we were let down by this hotel. The interiors is nice, basic but arty which I like. However when booking the suite room I requested one with a balcony which was confirmed via email. As we entered our room we didn’t have that at all... unfortunately our room was small and dingy as the window was in a separate area of the room which let limited natural light through. The bathroom was lovely however but didn’t fancy sleeping in there...When I came down stairs to ask about the room I requested the receptionist said it was booked. I showed the email that the colleague sent confirming the room and received a ‘sorry but it’s not our problem’. She then checked if it was available for us which it was on our last day. Seemed pointless but I wanted what I paid for for at least one day.  The room we asked for that we had for the last day was beautiful, much bigger, lovely balcony and so bright! It’s a shame we didn’t have this for the whole time as to have a coffee on the balcony in the morning would of been lovely. There is no comparison with the 2 rooms really. You certainly wouldn’t pay the same £100 p/n price for the first room being so basic and a lot smaller. The free coffee in the morning is good and the interior of the communal space is nice. Walking to the main areas of barcelona is easy, we didn’t use any transport even to the park which is about 45 minutes walk as it’s nice to see everything around. Gothic quarter is about 25 minutes walk and las Ramblas is about 15. I have emailed the hotel prior to this review to let them know my disappointment especially as it was my partners birthday present. The response was speedy however not the great. A few excuses about their policy and that both rooms are classed a ‘suites’. They agreed that their colleague made a mistake but other than that it was mostly trying to reason with me with excuses. Also a paragraph started with ‘We are not going to reimburse you any amount’ I didn’t even ask for a reimbursement in my email so that also got my back up.Unfortunately I won’t be staying again for the lack of care of my complaint in person and via email. If I had the room requested or at least the staff were a bit more concerned with my complaint my rating would be a lot higher. ","March 12, 2019","29    Praktik Garden

Housekeeping cleaned our room every day and it was spotless, the only thing that left us a little confused was the fact that there was a sign in the room which said that when your towels were hanging that they would not be changed. However ours got changed for clean ones every day, not really a problem, but when you’re trying to think of the environment it is not really sustainable especially when you give the guests the choice. Further on, in the morning till 12PM they have coffee machines available where you can make a cup of coffee and enjoy it outside on the terrace, breakfast is not available, but enough nice breakfast spots around!

Could hear doors shutting, people in neighbouring rooms talking they were so thin....shower leaked did not butter to report it as reception did not seem bothered.Hardly any views of the outside world like being in a cave, very little light or windows.Breakfast - Quite a good choice juices, croissants, bread, cheese meat etc. But hot drinks out of paper cups not good.Location - Good 25 mins from centre and 25 mins from Olympic stadium. Would we stay again NO as really is so basic it felt like a hostel.Good luck ","September 19, 2018","30    Hotel Paral.lel

1662,"I booked this hotel as a surprise 5-night get away for my girlfriends birthday.I have stayed around the Paralel area on a previous trip to Barcelona. I knew the location was spot on to go just about anywhere in the city so therefore I booked this hotel.Firstly, don’t let the 2-Star hotel rating put you off. This hotel is nicer than some 4-Star hotels I’ve stayed in. It’s spotlessly clean in the rooms and around the hotel. The decor looks cheap but modern and nice enough. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from Paralel metro which will get you just about everywhere in the city. It’s very close to a strips of restaurants and bars up all the side streets around the hotel and only around 20 minute walk to La Rambla & the docks.On to the negatives. I found a couple of the reception staff quite unfriendly and rude. We were never greeted (“good morning/good evening”) and when we arrived there wasn’t so much as a ‘hi’ or an introduction to the hotel or area. We were just instantly asked for our passports, a long pause and then told we would have to come back later at 3pm as our room wasn’t ready. I was happy to just leave my bags and go for a walk but a little bit more of an explanation wouldn’t have gone a miss. One of my main reasons for marking the scoring down is the fact that there is no shower room. The check out time on our last day was 11am (I thought this was more than reasonable), however our flight wasn’t until 9:30pm. When asking the reception if there were shower factories available to us when we came back to pick up our bags after making the most of our final day, they laughed in my face and just shook their heads. I didn’t think this was an unreasonable request and something I have always been offered in every hotel I’ve stayed in.Overall this is a reasonably priced hotel and I do think it’s star rating should be higher. Barcelona is a great city and this is a good base to see all the sites.","September 9, 2018","30    Hotel Paral.lel

1665,"When I book a short break or holiday I tend to rely much more on Trip Advisor rather than rely on the blurb in brochures/websites or official hotel star ratings and yet again Trip Advisor came up trumps with Paral-lel in Barcelona.For a 2 star hotel it completely exceeded my expectations.A modern clean reception with friendly staff.Our room (122) was a suite. We had 2 double bedrooms, a huge bathroom and a tiny terrace. The terrace probably ideal if you are a smoker. It's very small so wouldn't have much use for anything else. It was huge for just the 2 of us. Our room had everything we could have wanted. Reasonably priced minibar, safe, tea and coffee making facilities, TV and air. Con. It was spotlessly clean and well presented and was modern. A bonus was at night we didn't hear a single thing outside I which is great as we were city centre and expected some noise at night. Breakfast was on the 1st floor and set up as a buffet style with lots of choice. Yogurts, fresh fruits, sweet pastries, bread with cold meats and cheese, cereal and a small selection of an English breakfast option too. Do not be put off by the fact that this hotel is a 2 star. This can be down to little things such as no fitness centre or just the road its on etc. it in no way reflects the quality of the hotel which was fantastic. Location wise you are a 5 minute walk from the harbor and La Rambla","August 13, 2018","30    Hotel Paral.lel

1670,"I go to Barcelona every year, and my favorite hotels are all getting ridiculously expensive, so I tried Hotel Paral-lel because it is just a block from the Metro that goes directly from the train station and just about any place you will want to go to. It is also in the ‎Eixample neighborhood which I have been comfortable with. It is about a mile from Placa Espana and not too far from Placa de Gracia, which is just one metro station away. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I stayed with a friend in a twin bed room. Everything was very clean. We were able to set the air conditioning easily. For a modest hotel, I was surprised at the quality of the breakfast, and there was always something sweet in the lobby when we returned from a long day of touring. I will certainly stay there again.","June 25, 2018","30    Hotel Paral.lel

1671,"We had stayed at Hotel Paralel for four nights. During the second night I had returned to my hotel room to discover a personal hygiene tool had been placed in the bidet and cleaning solutions were left in the sink. We understand it is starting at peak season and staff have a lot on their plates but in our opinion this is unacceptable as it is a direct issue on my personal hygiene - to put it in a similar example it is the equivalent of putting somebody's toothbrush in the bidet. I raised our concerns via email to the hotel inbox (which we never received a response to) and also to the hotel manager, Juan, the next morning. Juan was less than empathetic and in fact, was rude and condescending. As a customer service manager myself, this is completely shocking and again, unacceptable. To quote him I was making it a big deal, it is a human error, what did we expect him to do about it. It was a struggle asking him for the next level manager's contact information, and even then, it took a week to receive a response. The response I received was I was not going to receive any form of compensation for my experience and if I should return to the hotel I would be offered a drink. I had also reached out to NN hotels group social media and have not received a response. I am utterly disappointed in my experience in hotel parallel, yes it is travel peak season (which reflects in the room premium price we've paid), but this is not an excuse to disregard guest experience. My network of family and friends are frequent travelers and many are actually in the travel industry. I have a reunion of 20 who will be travelling to Barcelona next March and we will be sure to not stay in hotel Paralel and hotels relating to this group. ","June 23, 2018","30    Hotel Paral.lel
