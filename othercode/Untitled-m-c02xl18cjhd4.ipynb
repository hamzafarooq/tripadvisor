The bathroom is so small that two people can’t be in at the same time. your bed is three steps away from the room door. I also took a picture of a bed . Do not stay at this hotel. Horrible place.

While the rooms are small, the hotel is quiet and the service is very good. Our included breakfast was fantastic. There are restaurants up and down the street and the neighborhood is safe at any hour. This is a great stay.\n",

      "  review_body : I stayed for a week in April, and while it was certainly adequate, I wouldn't return. My room was very small as was the bed. It had all the advertised amenities, free bottle of water daily, a kettle, a small fridge, AC, television with English stations etc, etc.I couldn't access the wifi and the remote for the tv was difficult to operate, I never did figure out how to turn it off and there was a glare from the screen every night for a few hours until it finally shut down. The walls were paper thin and lacked soundproofing. Of the three front desk staff I spoke with, 1 was sharp and abrupt, the other 2 were okay but not what I would call friendly, a smile would have been appreciated.I was travelling alone and I did feel safe though, it was very convenient being across the street from the main station as I used Milan as a base for day trips. I could go and get a coffee and pastry early in the morning before starting off. I didn't get breakfast because I would be l gone by 6 every morning and breakfast started later than that, plus it was quite pricey in my opinion.\n",

      "  review_body : Came across The Hotel Berna based on reviews, location and price. We had a great stay, albeit just one night. We stayed in a quality room w/ sofa. Average to larger size for similar Italian hotels. It met all of my needs in a hotel (clean, cool and quiet) at a reasonable price. Within walking distance of Milano Centrale as well as the Metro makes this a logical place to stay if arriving by train as well as being centrally located for business and pleasure activities in the city. The breakfast was outstanding as well as the service from all of the employees that we came in contact with. You can even personalize your stay prior to your arrival with the type of pillow you want, what complimentary beverages that you want stocked in the mini-fridge and what temperature you want in your room upon your arrival. Future trips to Milan will always find me here\n",

However, the reception staff was very unfriendly and was not helpful. Whatever we enquired (about Milan), it was answered with a shrug or 'I don't know'.Rooms are a good size and clean. It was comfortable for the 2 of us. I just wish the staff were friendlier.\n",

The hotel seems to have been totally updated and the reception rooms are a little quirky with modern paintings. the lift only has room for 2 but works.
