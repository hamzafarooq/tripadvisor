            "Paragraph:    the small and convenient hotel is located next to saldanha metro station very interesting design public areas and rooms are designed in the same style dominated by white which is natural and different shades of gray the room was not very large but quite comfortable beds are very good quality spacious wardrobe safe small refrigerator tv  the lighting is sufficient the bathroom comes with a hairdryer and a full set of toiletries towels were changed every day there is a special mirror for shaving which is convenientrating this 45 hotel white checked off all of the boxes for us  the only thing some people would not like is that it is a little far from the city center2530 min walk however the metro line is literally steps away from the hotel door    bed was super comfy and air conditioning worked very well  we opted for the breakfast option and it served us well but was nothing special    staff was great always willing to answer any of our questions and made our stay extra enjoyable    we went up to the roof top pool once in the rain to look at it  very small but would of been real nice to utilize  we spent too much time exploring so never took advantage  our visit was end of september so wasnt exactly pool weather either    happy we chose this hotel and would recommendi would rate this good rather than very good we had a very nice room but 2 twin beds pushed together when we had booked a deluxe double sliding door to the bathroom  personal preference would be for one you can close properly we were on the 9th floor so had a balcony which was a plus breakfast was ok  continental and not a particularly inspiring selection theres a metro stop right outside which was very handy and it only a minutes walk to the versailles cafe which is where we had a delicious breakfast both daysi spent 4 nights at this wonderful hotel for my birthday and would definitely recommend this accommodation for anyone visiting lisbon  the hotel is so clean and decorated beautifully  the rooms are well equipped and have very comfy beds and excellent showers the breakfast is great too and has a wide selection to choose from  the best thing about the hotel are the welcoming staff  they are so kind and friendly and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need a very big special thank you to the staff for the generous fruit basket and pastries and birthday card really appreciated the effort made  a special mention to pedro diego and the breakfast staff vlad wilson and vinicius for their hospitality  tips room comes with fridge and safe and you can askstayed here for 3 nights staff very attentive and friendly hotel was spotless nothing was too much trouble not a big hotel but big on service  hotel was minutes away from the metro and the city and only 5 mins from the airport would stay here againwe have just spent 2 nights at this excellent hotel and cant talk too highly about it  it is bang next to saldanha metro with easy connections into the rest of lisbon  the metro fares at 1 euro 50 cents for any ride is so cheap especially compared to london and when we left we got the metro straight to the airport  again for 150 we arrived from our cruise at 10 oclock and although check in is supposed to be 1500 they let us in straight away which made a huge difference to our day  the reception staff are excellent  helpful and friendly  we only had to ask for an adapter or a glass of orange and they were there  when we said we were going on the metro to the airport and were going to get the elevator on the other side of the road immediately our guy lifted upthis is a fairly new hotel in a very nice area very clean modern design extremely comfortable beds nice rooms well fitted out lovely rooftop pool area with great views young keen helpful staff secure underground parking just across the street   there are lots of good places to eat and drink close by  pastelaria versailles is brilliant for pastries and wonderful for breakfast galeto is another lisbon institution just across the road if you dont fancy eating there its great for a nightcap taxis are inexpensive and plentiful so getting around the city is easy a very good place to staythis place is the best nearby to all what you need on a holiday specially the staffs are super friendly and helpful if you need any information around the city or anythingrooms were pretty clean and beyond expectationthere are so many brilliant things about this hotel firstly it is literally steps from the closest metro which makes the whole of lisbon easy and quick to get to   the hotel is beautiful and spotless the rooms were cleaned everyday and chocolates fruit and water left for us each day we also had traditional belem pastries waiting for us on arrival too the rooms were modern and looked great   the rooftop bar was really nice and the pool looked inviting unfortunately the water was freezing and the weather a little too cold for us to appreciate it it would have been nice if they were able to heat the pool a little so it could be used throughout autumn too   the staff were friendly and helpful the breakfast was nice and there was a good choice however there is no cookedwe were blown away with the quality of this hotel for the price paid for 3 nights with breakfast this is a small boutique hotel with 5 rooms on each floor we arrived a little bit earlier than the 3pm check in time but this was no problem for the staff they checked us in to our rooms within 10 minutes our rooms were beautiful clean and had air con which was greatly appreciated the hotel is on a busy main road but we heard absolute no noise on the second floor facing the road the breakfast was of usual continental standard there was plenty of choice to eat  we absolutely loved the roof top pool bare in mind though it is only small with around 8 sun beds this provided great views over the city of lisbon the hotel is also situated in the heart of lisbon so yourethis hotel is very clean modern and despite being on a main road   surprisingly quiet we had two rooms on the first floor both were clean with good air con small ish bathrooms breakfast was good but nothing hot no tea or coffee in the rooms rooftop pool was great but only about 8 sun beds up there the freezing cold water and high winds made it near impossible to go in still  it was a nice place to hang out for an hour or two in the late afternoon if its not too hot you can walk everywhere but with the heat of the summer we decided to take the metro which was quick easy and cool its about a forty minute walk to rossio area and about 20 mins to eduardo park  nice to do in the evening but to get to anywhere else youll need the metro or bus there arent many signswe had a very good stay at this hotel  their greatest asset being the impeccable cleanliness and the location of the hotel close to the metro and in the heart of lisbon  the hotel is open 24 hours a day with a nice pool the staff is very warm and kind  regarding the lack of the hotel i would say the lack of insulation that we can easily hear the neighbors and the fact that we are watched by the staff when we have lunch  but it didnt affect our stay at this hotel for 10 days  thank yougreat hotelnice helpful staff brilliant showers nice area feels safe and is super easy to get to places  being right  next to the metro  water fruit and chocolate in the room every day  staff really knowledgeable and also really helpful  would definitely stay here again  nice places to eat nearbyvery clean room friendly and young staff pool and solarium on the roof we paid an honest price perfect position for transport and colinas restaurant in 3 minutes walk we will surely be back next time in lisboneasy access from lisbon airport as there is a metro station directly outside the hotel  very funky modern establishment  our room was very well equipped and exceptionally quiet for a city centre hotel  decent sized rooftop pool which we would love to have swum in had our stay had been during one of the warmer months  all staff were very helpful and professional  vlad in particular was very proactive during the breakfast serviceour criteria for a hotel for a city break in the summer is simple it needs to be clean comfortable have good access to public transport if it is not in the centre of all tourist attractions as a bonus serve a decent breakfast and have a pool   hotel white lisboa offers all of this it is situated right by the entrance to the saldana metro station it is spotlessly clean the standard rooms were comfortable the rooms and bathrooms were small but more than adequate for a city break and the shower was one of the best i have encountered in any hotel the rooftop pool is small and cold but we appreciated being able to spend an hour or two up there in the late afternoon after walking  around the sites of lisbon all day  breakfast served daily and included in the price of ourgreat hotel  small quiet friendly staff and extremely helpful as we had arrived from cape verde without our luggage they kindly provided us with some essentials well located for transport and local bars and restaurants all within walking walkable to centre too if you dont mind walking very clean would definitely stay here againstayed for four nights on a room only basis hotel literally next to metro stop for touring around the city also a really nice bakery next door for breakfast if you dont take the bb option at the hotel  rooms are very comfortable and immaculately clean we had a problem whern our flight back home was cancelled without notice from the airline the hotel staff could not have been more helpful  and we got things sorted out  thanks to everyone at the hoteli stayed 3

how to get there my room was beautiful spotless and well designed with a big window overlooking the republic ave the bed was very comfortable with soft pillows i also loved that the tv was part of the mirror and the lighting of the room all very minimalistic  the bathtub and shower were big and the shower head was good with strong water pressure which was very nice  you get a bottle of water and

lovely hotel which is no more than 2 minutes from rossio metro station upon arrival we were welcomed and shown to our upgraded room which was beautiful the staff were very friendly and so helpful

surprise present this made my wife feel so special the hotel is close to many of lisbons attractions and transport links there is a sister hotel next door with a restaurant and rooftop bar which gave stunning views over the city great for a late night drink  the breakfast was excellent with a great choice of hotgreat location and beautiful hotel but best of all was the staff who were fully prepared for post covid19 travellers with gel stations everywhere and staff wiping every surface after anyone has touched it free drink at the bar  barman friendly and experienced in making cocktails  breakfast was excellent and wellplanned with table settings brought after guests are seated and great options of extras eg smoked salmon and scrambled eggsthough i may be a tad biased after the glass of bubbly offered with our orange juice  definitely will revisit in the futureunassuming hotel as its quite hidden away but once your in the lobby the quality is immediately obvious  all the staff were exceptional which most hotels struggle with they were attentive a thoughtful prepared plates and cutlery when we ordered food in any time my taxi arrived they contacted me even though i didnt tell them i ordered one d   breakfast was very good plenty of variety and fresh macarons and nata were especially good  we were also upgraded as the hotel seemed rather empty and room was very nice and had welcome drink water and chocolates  definitely will book here when im back in lisbon a special thank you to the reception staff from 1st  3rd march \n",

cant wait to visit againa great stay in this city centre hotel having enjoyed the hospitality of a number of small family places on our portugal trip it was a pleasant surprise for a big city hotel to give such a nice efficient and friendly welcome at reception the following morning the breakfast lady was similarly informative and very friendly nice to see such positive staff our room a small suite was a good size immaculately clean with large tv good wifi fridge safe and even a small bottle of port as a welcome gift the bathroom was very good quality and similarly sparkling clean breakfast was efficiently delivered from buffet behind a screen from the displayed choice simply by asking or pointing at what was required from fruits breads meats cheeses cereals etc additionally there wasgreat hotel friendly staff nice breakfast well served by olga a very friendly and nice person  the location of the hotel is exceptional in the heart of lisbon the rooms are very convenient larger than

decent shower  breakfast was plentiful and the team kept everything topped up  breakfast is back to a buffet style but all guests are required to wear gloves when selecting their food as well as wearing masks when you are moving around the restaurant id definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to lisbonwe loved this hotel we stayed for 3 nights as a part of our honeymoon upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite the room was fabulous and so spacious the staff were so helpful and friendly the location was perfect so central to everything we would definitely recommendi really love the location and rooms are very comfortable staff couldnt be nicer specially shout out to olga at the dining room and marian at the front desk they go above and beyond in their

stay here again if we ever come back thanks againi was at the hotel for 4 nights and had an amazing experience the staff are extremely helpful and friendly the location is ideal super central and surrounded by nice restaurant options very grateful for hugo nadiya and ricardo who supported me through some personal hard times too with excellent service and much empathy i will certainly be back in the hotel next timemy stay at hotel santa justa was perfect everything was cleaned and organised excellent breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff  keep in mind that the hotel is located on a very touristic street if you are bothered with this it can be a problem for us it was not a problem as we wanted a very central accommodation where we could do everything on foot i recommend the hotel and i would stay there againthis couldnt have been any more perfect after the long flight to portugal we stayed here a couple of nights to recuperate and get acquainted with lisbon for the first time  i wish we could have stayed longer  the room was spacious clean and comfortable loved the walkin shower the robes the toiletries the decor the comfy bed the french balcony we even purchased the breakfast with the room rate and were pleasantly surprised how wonderful it was we will definitely be back and stay here againme and my family stayed in lisbon for about 56 days and the hotel was nice you get a complementary breakfast everyday and the rooms and showers were nice as well i would definitely book this hoteli first came here in 2016 and gave it a 5star review nothing has changed great locality super friendly and helpful staff clean rooms good restaurant one thing new however you arrive in your room to an ample bottle of port and some sweets  cant think of a better place to anchor your visit to this magical city of lisboalocation was great within easy walking distance to all the top tourist destinations the concierge was very helpful in setting up tours and recommending restaurants we enjoyed the tuesday night fado dinner very much good value for the i first came here in 2016 and gave it a 5star review nothing has changed great locality super friendly and helpful staff clean rooms good restaurant one thing new however you arrive in your room to an ample bottle of port and some sweets  cant think of a better place to anchor your visit to this magical city of lisboawe had originally booked this hotel for december 2020 on a no refund no exchange with all  the covid restrictions we were not able to travel from the uk at that time  the santa justa went above  beyond in my opinion as not only did they honour our reservation until december 2021  to be taken at our choice they upgraded us to a junior suite on arrival  for this we thank you very much   the hotel  is in an ideal location just a minutes walk away from the metro station at rossio surrounded by restaurants shops bars  many of the beautiful sights of lisbon  the rooms are extremely comfortable with high quality bed linen  the most amazing beds  pillows  might have been all the sightseeing wearing us outbut we had the best sleep in these beds the rooms havei hope that this is not too premature but i must say it is nice to be back travelling at the very least we did manage to get in this trip to portugal just before the closing of 2021 unfortunately things are heating up again with the new omicron variant but we remain optimistic that things will eventually settle down they most certainly will at any rate we arrived in portugal on november 28 rented a vehicle and spent the first ten days or so visiting the algarve area and then returned our car and spent the last three nights in lisbon  our research in where to stay while in lisbon resulted in us booking three nights at the hotel santa justa lisboa a very good choice this hotel truly lives up to all its claims we found out afterwards that rather than using thea very good 4star hotel in the middle of a bustling area  the rooms were comfortable and the restaurant was fine  what stood out for me was the helpfulness of the front desk staff with booking tours and transport and making sure we each had a boxed breakfast for our very early flight out  the restaurant staff were friendly and efficient and made our husbands happy by switching the dining rooms cable channel to the live champions league game after hearing that we failed to get tickets  little personal touches make a big differencethis hotel epitomizes excellence in every way   we arrived here early after leaving our cruise and they were able to check us into a roomas unexpected as it was it was a wonderful gift for two very tired travelers   first of all the location is perfect a delightful street close to everything and a beautiful hotel and superb staff i cant say enough kind words for this place  its all in the details their attention to making you feel special will amaze you it is because of this hotel and staff that we cant wait to return to lisbon and then theres the restaurantfor which i will write a separate review  dont look any furtherits the best trust me  thank you to all of you who made our short stay in lisbon a memorable one we cant thank you enoughthis was the second time i stayed at santa justa hotel the hotels location is perfect chiado alfama as well as the major turistic atractions are all close by such as castelo de so jorge praa do mercado mosteiro do carmo av da liberdade rua augusta and the list goes on the metros green line is only 3 min away making it easy to reach the parque das naes and the oceanrio de lisboa plus the airport the metro ticket costs only 150 per trip a real bargain the classic room is great it looks modern the bathroom is of a good size and has an amazing shower with a strong water pressure very relaxing the towels are big and heavy and toiletries are of a good quality staff is well trained and very helpful and welcoming breakfast is very good with fruits amy husband and i made our 3rd trip to portugal and our first stop was hotel santa justa it was everything you could ask for in a hotel yes the location is perfect for strolling the water frontvisting the elevator and enjoying fine food what really stood out to me was the staff there was no question they did not gladly answer with patience and kindness as others have said the breakfast was a very nice start to our day with a good variety of food from which to choosebottom linego to lisbon and stay herewe had originally booked this hotel for december 2020 on a no refund no exchange with all  the

welcomed us with a bottle of port wine and some very tasty portuguese egg tarts  when we discovered a problem with our air conditioner the friendly and accommodating staff moved us to another room with minimal disruption  finally the complementary breakfast was the best we had on our whole european vacationwe stayed in room 302 between october 22 and october 26  our stay was absolutely superb one of the best hotels i have stayed in  all the staff were friendly and we spoke a mixture of portuguese spanish and english with them  thank you to the young gentleman with glasses who took our bags up to our room  unfortunately i didnt catch his name  on arrival in the room we were greeted with a bottle of port wine and pastis de nata  there was also a chocolate left on our beds and the minibar was free  we loved the walkin shower and comfortable beds as well as the breakfast which was wide ranging  masks and gloves were used at breakfast which showed the hotels commitment to cleanliness  the staff were also kind enough to call a taxi for us which left early in the morningexcellent hotel right in the centre of lisbon stayed for 5 nights room was very spacious and spotless 2 streets away from the santa justa lift and the main street of lisbon lots of restaurants shops nearby and close to rossio station for trains and trams would definitely stay againexcellent placement in the

lookout  i could tell right away that every detail was well thought out with the best use of space and materials  we came for my birthday celebration and couldnt have picked a more romantic stay  from the hermes amenities to the daily chocolate truffles the 5pm walking tour highly recommended and wonderful breakfast offerings plus a location walkable to fashionable chiado we would certainly stay

even the most demanding guest can dream of beautiful views from room and restaurant great food but most importantly amazing service from start to finish will definitely stay here againfrom our arrival

fantastic we enjoied our stay very much the breakfast is brilliant and the view at the front rooms is breath taking thank you for a super staythe memmo hotel is in the very city centre but does not feel like that somehow hidden from the street you need to enter a narrow passway built on the hillside overlooking the city this hotel lets you relax during your city trip our rooms had a terrace reinforcing this feeling even more the lobby restaurant bar and openair areas are wonderful to relax they even have a small openair swimming pool the breakfast is fantastic last but not least they have an excellent guest relations department francisca who will help you will all your tourism and dining requeststhe hotel is beautiful with nice wood work the location is perfect with a beautiful view of lisbon  there are many good restaurants close by and it is a short walk to the tourist areas  all the staff are very friendly and helpful joao at the front desk greeted us by names and made us feel like home we stayed for a week for work and the pool area is a great spot  to plug in our computers and work with a backdrop of the city  we will stay here again when we are back for funwonderful hotel with great service redeemed marriott bonvoy points for a three night stay not any titanium elite benefits to speak of but none were expected since this is a design property the room was exceptionally quiet and we appreciated the blackout curtains balcony modern design and location room wasnt spacious but was very functional complimentary in room port cocktail and fruit dish were nice touches ubers are much cheaper in lisbon than they are in california so we took them everywhere this location is not very conducive to mass transit from what i could tell   the memmo is a small property so dont expect early check in or late checkout i was lucky to get a 1 pm departure   we didnt partake of the 30 euro pp breakfast but did enjoy a pitcher of ginthis gem of a hotel is nestled in the hillside of a beautiful part of lisbon truly a unique property with beautiful views of lisbon throughout every team member was very attentive and welcoming from the moment we arrived very clean modern and well appointed rooms pleasantly surprised by the terrific restaurant on site and great indooroutdoor spaces will definitely be backgreat hotel very friendly staff we visited lisbon in september 2021 the location of the hotel is good there are some good restaurants nearby  to alfama you have to go by taxi otherwise it is too far that was no problem for us the breakfast was really goodthis is a stunning hotel with such attention to detail on every level would 100 recommend such kind staff who look after your every need but leave you to your independence too the views are amazing and the location is super cool love the street its off and the cafes and bars surrounding the hotel are authentic and fun \n",

            "Paragraph:    we have stayed in this hotel for 2 nights the hotel is great it is value for money our room was very beautiful and very clean  we love the design the amenities the smell in th lobby and above all the small detail they have left for my bestfriends birthday the location is perfect close to the metro rossio very convenient tofrom the airport the train to go to sintra the line 15e to go to belem tower and walkable to all the main attractions staffs are friendly thanks for everything we will definetly comebackwe stayed at the hotel for 3 nights during the new year week the checkin  checkout process was very smooth the standard double room was small considering we were traveling with a 5yr old kid but we were mentally prepared for it and didnt have any issue otherwise we managed to accomodate our 4 suitcases in the room without much issues the best part of the room is the setup  facilities are contemporary as well as the design with lots of useful spaces to keep your stuff the location is a plus with hardly a 5 minute walk to rossio station later on the trip we stayed at another hotel higher rated  on av liberdade for 3 nights and without a doubt my story tejo was much superior than that one we would recommend this hotel for a nofrills stay in lisbon anyday overall i had a very good experience in this hotel and would happily come back mostly for its ideal location    what i really enjoyed   ideal location close by trams metro and station at a short walk from all restaurants and shops  very realiable internet  good size bedroom with nice decoration and design comfortable bed   rituals washing products in the bedroom it smells amazing    what could be improved   although staff was friendly i found them lacking professionalism and knowledge there was an issue with the thermostat of my room it was 28c and ac wouldnt work i had to call them 3 times to have it fixed assuring me each time it was solved and that temperature was centrally managed by the reception in reality it is not managed centrally as we cangreat location but would have preferred a choice of rooms instead of the roof of the adjacent bldg no views in a beautiful city and i was on the top floor  the room was very nice boutique hotel but was a little strange that every evening when the temperature rise in the room i had to call the front desk to lower the temp they controlled the thermostat from the front desk overall a great location close to rossi station all the shops chiado but i may try their other location the figueira across the street next timewe had an overnight stay at my story hotel tejo we booked directly with the hotel  their communication was excellent the location is fantastic very central room was pretty new but pretty small as we expected in such a central location breakfast was pretty average overall a pleasant staywe stayed here for 5 nights the location is super convient to everything the room was very nice clean  the only problem was that our heat was not working  the room got very warm at night and when we mentioned it in the morning the response was that they would shut it off  we ended up leaving the window open at night but then it got too cold   breakfast was good not real good  staff was friendly and helpfulin november 2019  another teacher and i led a group of students to a conference in lisbon and stayed in hotel tejo largely because of what seemed to be a perfect location  in addition their prearrival communication was superb  they were patient as our group size changed as we had specific requests for room location and as we had many questions to be answered hotel tejo turned out to be even better that we had hoped our group was on two floors and could easily communicate for group work  the seating area outside the breakfast room was perfect for gathering computer research and writing andfinalizing group plans   all of the staff were friendly and helpful i want to mention especially silvia telmo rafael nina patricia tiago and oksana and hope i did notwe booked this hotel for our three days citytrip because its central and close to everything we had a great experience here the rooms are very clean and the interior is very nice the bathroom is a bit small but nothing to complain about the breakfast has everything you need there is also a very friendly staff who will help you with all your problems we will definitely recommend thismyself  mt husband stayed in this hotel i would highly recommend it it was reasonably priced  the room  bathroom were exceptional it was my bday  i dont know knew but we came back to the room to a bottle of champagne  cake such a lovely surprise it is centrally located  spotless i wouldnt hesitate to go backstayed here for a night when visiting lisbon  excellent value spotlessly clean right in the middle of the touristy area lots of restaurants close by checkin and out were easy ticks all the boxes recommendedthe location for this hotel is incredible  so close to everything i wanted to see in lisbon or the public transit to take me there one thing that was weird was that i had no ability to control the ac  i was on the 5th floor  it got hot maybe not hot for portguese but definitely hot for a canadian  i had to phone down to have control over the ac to be able to turn it on  next day  same thing  i think it happened 3 times  they have a screen that monitors temperature  would agree that it was hot  but why did this need me to say im hot numerous times other than that it was quiet at night very clean and nice shower  internet worked well in the roomsexcellent central location with bars and restaurants literally on the door step very handy for the old town and castle as well decent rooms and very helpful staff on reception a little tired in places but excellent as a central basethe hotel is located very near a plaza with a great and vibrant market it is also very near both the trolley and bus stops and an easy walk to the train station to catch the train to cascais 40 minute ride and a  must visit town it is also surrounded by shops and restaurants and just a few steps to the pedestrianonly streets leading to the river just through the old arch its an easy walk to lisbons champs elysee as well so its really a perfect location for people watching exploring and dining we were upgraded to a larger room a minisuite of sorts for no extra charge  during our weeks stay even so the room was small as was the bathroom that said it was very clean very modern and fine as we were really only there for sleeping and sleeping was great thethe location was great  it was within walking distance from pretty much everywhere we wanted to go  the view from the room was fantastic  it was the first hotel we stayed for our honeymoon of 1 month around europe  the hotel went above and beyond to make our stay memorable  the only thing that took away 1 star from my review was the breakfast  our package included breakfast so we went down for breakfast daily  we stayed 4 nights but the menu was exactly the same during the entire staywe loved this hotel the location is perfect  it was our first time in lisbon and were so happy that we chose this place when we booked  there is so much to see in this city and the hotel is right in the center of it  easy access to public transport when we did not feel like walking   the hotel itself is very nice  and the staff were so helpful and nice  we thought that before the virus scare forced us to abandon the rest our trip and the staff really came through for us when we were scrambling to make new plans    i do not see how anyone could have been more helpful and encouraging during this timebeen there on the week of june 15th the usual friendly and efficient staff from reception to the room i felt very safe but with the human touch we always like to have from the moment you step in the hotel you feel you are in a safe environment but without beeing excessive  the hotel is very well located and the perfect choice in this new timeswe are very pleased with our experience at this hotel from the start the staff was very helpful with everything they speak and understand english very well we booked a double room and it was very spacious more than we expected it was  clean and everything looked very well taken care of the bed and pillows are comfortable the ac  worked well during the nights it would get very cold we also did not have any problem with outside noise  as for the location the hotel is perfectly located everyhting is of walking distance  there is also a parking space in front of the hotel for scooters or motors this made it great for travelling   over and all we loved our stay in lisbon   ps as for the people who are wondering about the corona virus in lisbon people take it verythis is an exciting hotel that has a historic site in its restaurant a well that had been dug hundreds of years before civilization this well is so important that the government asked the hotel to preserve it ask to see the well whenever you are in the environswe stayed for a week we were upgraded to a larger room but even with that it was pretty right quarters comfy bed street noise but with windows closed silence convenient location to the river area and all that it offers lots of restaurants and shopping nearby near trolley stops and train to cascais great breakfast buffet very good value staff were wonderful very helpful and friendly and professional highly recommend for travelling a midrange budgeti needed a place to stay in while searching for an apartment to rent and this place was the perfect place i personally loved the tight corridors and the modern rooms in this old building the hotel is located in a really busy area and is close to everything you might need from metros to restaurants and city viewpoints i recommend this hotel whenever youre in lisboni like the location which was quite convienent as it was centrally located next to all the outdoor activities and at rossio and the building is quite old i liked that the price of rhte hotel was only 40p night which was great for oktober when still sunny  the room however 514 had an very not nice smell of hamburgers if you opened the windows and i also felt it was quite loud so i did not slept very good  the reception is not very helpful it is very much barbie and ken on the reception and they do not understand your needs  unless this hotel is offering me anything i might not stay here againoverall i had a very good experience in this hotel and would happily come back mostly for its ideal location    what i really enjoyed   ideal location close by trams metro and station at a short walk from all restaurants and shops  very realiable internet  good size bedroom with nice decoration and design comfortable bed   rituals washing products in the bedroom it smells amazing    what could be improved   although staff was friendly i found them lacking professionalism and knowledge there was an issue with the thermostat of my room it was 28c and ac wouldnt work i had to call them 3 times to have it fixed assuring me each time it was solved and that temperature was centrally managed by the reception in reality it is not managed centrally as we canwe have stayed in this hotel for 2 nights the hotel is great it is value for money our room was very beautiful and very clean  we love the design the amenities the smell in th lobby and above all the small detail they have left for my bestfriends birthday the location is perfect close to the metro rossio very convenient tofrom the airport the train to go to sintra the line 15e to go to belem tower and walkable to all the main attractions staffs are friendly thanks for everything we will definetly comebackthe location for this hotel is incredible  so close to everything i wanted to see in lisbon or the public transit to take me there one thing that was weird was that i had no ability to control the ac  i was on the 5th floor  it got hot maybe not hot for portguese but definitely hot for a canadian  i had to phone down to have control over the ac to be able to turn it on  next day  same thing  i think it happened 3 times  they have a screen that monitors temperature  would agree that it was hot  but why did this need me to say im hot numerous times other than that it was quiet at night very clean and nice shower  internet worked well in the roomswe stayed here for 5 nights the location is super convient to everything the room was very nice clean  the only problem was that our heat was not working  the room got very warm at night and when we mentioned it in the morning the response was that they would shut it off  we ended up leaving the window open at night but then it got too cold   breakfast was good not real good  staff was friendly and helpfulgreat location but would have preferred a choice of rooms instead of the roof of the adjacent bldg no views in a beautiful city and i was on the top floor  the room was very nice boutique hotel but was a little strange that every evening when the temperature rise in the room i had to call the front desk to lower the temp they controlled the thermostat from the front desk overall a great location close to rossi station all the shops chiado but i may try their other location the figueira across the street next timegood hotel with perfect location for exploring the room we had was spacious and modern the only negative was the staff were a little cold making us come down and pick up an ironing board and iron versus delivering to our room altogether would still very much recommendgood hotel in very central location room a little tight and a ropey view but just dont stay in and look out the window all day your not hear to stay in the room you can do that at home but hotel and room clean and tidy  however a very special shout out to the guy in the image matheus he was simply magical always smiling we could tell even behind the face mask he helped us out of a particularly tough scenario and also managed to get us a room at the eleventh hour thanks matheus good luck in your careerwe stayed here for five nights in mid september21 the hotel exceeded our expectations in each category front desk staff room size decor cleanliness amenities proximity to restaurants attractions and access to public transportation   starting with front desk staff mr mendes and mr gomes both answered my email queries promptly within a business day helped alleviate my concerns about covid and provided detailed directions  to the hotel from lisbon airport using metro  mr matheu gomes went above and beyond by going on a hunt for more comfortable pillow so that i got good nights sleep our room was on the fourth floor facing inside well which made it bit dark but upside was peace and quiet at night exterior rooms can be bit noisy because of street noise hotelvery clean and modern it seems like the hotel has been refurbished lately everything looks clean and new bed was super comfy and the room is totally soundproof i slept there like a stone if you are looking for comfort youre at the right place \n",

            "Paragraph:    we stayed at this hotel for four nights and loved it the location is in a good neighborhood and close to ave liberdade thoroughfare with terrific restaurants and good transportation options the hotel is clean and the reception staff was very kind and attentive to our requests the breakfast is free and largeand always had my husbands favorite custard tarts the portuguese pasteis de nata they also have hot scrambled eggs a range of 5 rollscrescent rolls etc cereal fruit juices and more i would like to thank the very kind breakfast angel aina [sorry i may have the spelling wrong] who was attentive without hovering and kept things clean and stocked with fresh food when i had trouble with the coffee machine she instantly lent a hand without being nosy ori stayed here for a long overnight layover in lisbon the breakfast spread was better than i expected and better than other holiday inn expresses ive stayed at the room was a decent size for the price and had all the necessities it isnt right in the thick of things but given lisbons size it was easy to walk around to the main attractions if youre willing to walk a bit more than 2030 minuteskeeping in mind that its a 3 star hotel it met all our expectations and more centrally located reasonably priced  attentive staff excellent service the room and bathroom are tiny and very clean we never heard noise from neighbouring rooms or the corridors in our 4 night visit breakfast was ok i would have liked to see more fresh vegetables than the cucumbers and tomatoes that were provided  free wifi worked wellvery nice clean hotel in good location with very friendly staff like philip ana tika ana and they have a complimentary free breakfast highly recommended it is surely a home away from home that we will surely come backmy family and i recently stayed at holiday express in lisbon right before christmas eve and we had an amazing experience the hotel is centrally located to shopping and all the tourist sites the hotel is more like a boutique hotel instead a regular holiday inn the breakfast was very generous and yes the have fresh pastel de nata and the customer service from the front desk is top level i have to publicly recognize adrian who one night warmed our dinner and served it on a plate with utensils also since we checked our early the front desk had a to go breakfast for us lastly you cant beat the price i paid less than 80 a nightwe stayed here for 3 nights check in was quick as we got there in the afternoon our room was on the first floor but could not hear any street noises room was a decent size with a comfortable bed a small couch safe kettle small bar fridge a chair and desk breakfast was included and the options were decent there were a lot of upmarket shops around and a pingo doce market about 400 metres around the corner bus stops were in the vicinity and there was airport transfer to drop us off 5 minutes from the hotel we purchased a viva viagem card and topped it up with a 24 hour credit that we used on the buses metro and trams to top up the card after 24 hours the best option is to find a local store displaying a payshop icon or a metro station with a manned ticket counterlisbon  what a charm  of course you have to like history and go with flow attitude there are many sites to visit and many things to do but you have to be patient with locals and tourists there are lines everywhere  our hotel was a little bit out off the centro histrico right in the heart of all the designers shops simple hotel  with breakfast included i am not a breakfast eater but it help if you are watching your budget room was small but clean staff was very friendly  i love the tuk tuk experience it is price different companies and different prices started at 50 euros  in europeans countries problem is everything was closed from dec 24 around 6 pm to dec26  even the main attractions and restaurantsfriendly staff and good services the room was big and comfortable public parking in front of the hotel 1624h good location near marques de pombal square great option for future visits to lisbonthe main advantage is location  only 25 min drive fromto internet airport  3 min walk to metro station and marques de portal square some 15 min walking distance to other places of interest very friendly and helpful staff breakfast might be a bit better in terms of choicelocation is a plus but smelly rooms due wear and tear carpet and ventilation cold water for showers recepcionist not willing to satisfy customer they have a smiley book and see attached comments such  bed to small we are married couple for over 30 year they gave us a single bed pity because the brand or chain of hotels is respectable and we should wait more for a 3 star hotelsmall comfortable room with good quality beds you come to expect from holiday inn hotels bathroom was clean and small but good shower pressure so nothing to complain about hotel is not necessarily located in a central location only high end shops in walking distance but you can easily take the metro around town breakfast is complementary for stay here the only complaint i have is how slow the service staff can be here in the hotel on the day of check out we had asked the reception to book a taxi to the train station and she really took her time when getting that done while serving other customers checking in who came after us in any case we missed our train and had to be rebookedthere are hotels in the pedestrianfree area near praca do comercio you can be closer to the nightlife in bairro alto you cant get more authentic than finding a lodging in alfama but we found this hotel perfect for our needs and plans located at the north end of lisbons champs elysees avenida da liberdade with its black and whitepatterned sidewalks just south of the major marques de pombal metro station the holiday inn express offers a complimentary breakfast including both hot and cold items acceptably fast and free wifi and comfortable rooms with a number of englishlanguage channels  we could even watch criminal minds ihg platinum elites can elect 2 free drinks from the bar which is really one end of the reception desk and the business center consistswe booked this hotel in lisbon because its very close to the liberdade metro station just around the corner its recently been refurbished and our room was very nice very comfortable beds and pillows that were soft on one side and firm on the other we had a kettle and tea  coffee in the room and also a safe the bathroom was very modern with a really good shower breakfast was excellent with a really good choice  including a machine that made pancakes and also the famous portuguese custard tarts yummy the only issue we had was that there are not too many restaurants in the immediate area although if you turn left out of the hotel  keep going until you reach the university  a student area there are a few more there is a small restaurant next door to the hotel whichwe come to portugal every february for week  to get away from the uk weather our usual hotel had jacked up the prices so we looked elsewhere and discovered this hotel it still a walkable distance from our favourite restauranto saboroso and the clatter factor  how much noise the breakfast staff make with the crockery and cutlery is very low compared to our usual hotel further north towards parque station  the reception staff are amazing especially the girlie who worked the bar in the late evening their english is very good they could even communicate with a party of 60  scousers who were on a school tripthe checkin staff was very friendly and the entire staff so far seems here to please i am still at the property but had quite the opposite experience of the previous reviewer  i am a platinum as well but did not receive any upgrade quite the opposite received one of the smallest rooms on the 2nd floor its a little disappointing but its not the only hotel which does not do anything for platinum members and i am fine with that though it would make for an even better experience if they did honor status  the rooms are nice and comfortable with everything you could need  the only thing that is  missing like mentioned by someone else is an ioning board and ion which is usually available in other hiexpress properties but i believe a call to the reception would take care ofthe hotel is in a good location not at the center but not to far 15 min walk  like any other holidayinn it have all that you need for urban vacation  the rooms are large and well equipped it was clean and comfortable the breakfast is free and it is very good start for the day  had only bit problem with the wifi in my room but i think its because my room was on the corner  other places in the hotel it worked good all together i like this hotelhotel had quite a few positives and a few points that might not suit everyone certainly clean good bathrooms comfortable beds and adequate breakfast location is good as many others state but you need to be closer in to the centre if you dont like walking or be prepared to use the buses a lot not so good points  not the most spacious room lack of storage space for clothes and bedroom was too warm for us hotel wouldnt turn the air con on as they said it was winter and the majority of travellers were heating their rooms according to their computer the fact that the temperature was between 21 degrees and 26 degrees outside didnt matter you could open the windows a little but not enough and the road outside is very busy so from 600am onwards it was noisy  not a badthe staff lobby covid precautions and breakfast were excellent our only issue was our room we were upgraded very much appreciated and again the staff couldnt have been better the room has no cabinets only one shelf and the mattress was extremely firm i dont know if this is just indicative of european hotels but we stayed for 3 nights and had no place to put our stuff and pretty much lived out of our suitcase the location is excellent and we would recommend this property just know there is really no place other than a few hangers to put any clothing if youre staying more than a night also i should note that they did not have nor were able to provide a shower cap that my wife needed its not something they haveaverage hotel we were greeted by a unfriendly desk clerk on a saturday morning she was pretty rude in explaining the covid requirements and early checkin needs i had booked 3 rooms for three nights and she offered ihg points only on one room even though i paid for all the rooms one of the nights we walked into the lobby at midnight and the guy at the desk didnt even raise his eyes let alone offering a

properties are quite nice this one isnt pretty much everything was as expected cant really  complain but cant say it was something special either  i already stayed here 25 years ago so my expectations were not high especially because at this time  i paid 99 more and i feel that a 86 rate per night for one person is far too much i would have chosen another hotel for a better price only if i couldstayed here during our lisbon city break basic breakfast but enough to get you started for a day of touring the city  friendly front of house staff and the rooms where cleaned daily basic hotel but better than other holiday inns i have stayed ingreat hotel excellent staff  although no parking available for the hotel only paid parking during the week difficult to find parking  weekends free

was the breakfast the first morning i requested the hot breakfast and everything on the plate was cold except for the eggs i pointed this out and it was returned with half of the original items and what tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave the second morning i requested a crepe and again it was cold  i noticed many other disgruntled customers complaining about the delays and similar

to be exceptional admittedly the meaning of details is different for different people but none of us have done anything but enjoy right through the entire stay what is so good then we start with the location unbeatable on a street inside the large boulevard that goes down to the water so central but no disturbing sounds at all an oasis in the middle of the city in addition the narrow ruas das

lovely staff cant wait to come visit again the pool was really nice to spend the day and great to relax away from the city the bed was also really comfortable service is amazing from start to endthis is a gorgeous property in a beautiful central location in lisbon for the price i would say the overall experience was subpar my room being streetfacing there was quite a bit of noise at all hours of

have the place all for yourself the breakfast was very good  one of the best i had from a hotel not buffet but a la carte  unlimited though also  breakfast is until 12 i highly recommende to book a room with breakfast included only downside is that the outdoor swimming pool is not heated  so no one was using it   tip we gotive never really thought about going to lisbon but when my daughter was

of house service and a very spacious room the bed bedding and pillows were very comfortable and conducive to high quality sleep blackout blinds around the room too  pool is in an interesting part of the building and very relaxed feel  lots of different areas inside the hotel to explore and the garden for drinks is beautiful  concierge was also very helpful with ideas of where to eat zapata ramiro and to traveli stayed in the hotel for 4 nights and had very nice stay the hotel has beautiful interiors and cosy rooms entire space smelled beautifully  my room however had some leaks on the wall and needs refreshing up   the food at the breakfast was delicious and plenty  however salad of asparagus was a bit of a joke i got one asparagus cut in half and half of cherry tomato important to point out is that one could order two of these salads these were included in the breakfast price  the most disappointing was that yet another hotel does not recognise single customers and charge them price for double room and double breakfast a discount for single breakfast would be at least expecteda beautiful hotel and super location the interiors are stunning feel very palatial but with a modern twist the rooftop pool area was a great place to hangout after a long day sightseeing loved the breakfast super service on the whole a bit slow at timeswe booked 5 nights at the one in lisbon for our second only break since covid it seemed to tick all our boxes new or newly refurbished boutique hotel pool gym and outdoor area we arrived to be greeted by a very friendly reception guy who told us our room was ready he then said without prompting that if we wrote a good review and they could check it first then they would give us a free bottle of wine he laughed and called this portuguese blackmail well as a lawyer i dont do blackmail and nor do i write unfair reviews   in any event we were shown to our room which was very small with a tiny window on the top floor when i booked the room we booked a deluxe which was one up from the cosy room both of which are shown and described on the hotel website we wentwhat a beautiful hotel with very welcoming staff spotless room great location and an incredible setting the terrace and pool are incredible which makes the fact we couldnt use them even more disappointing  day two of our two day break the hotel has a wedding on which means all amenities are closed to guest no indication of this when booking at no point were we informed that the hotel would be closed to us the whole reason we booked the hotel was for the pool and facilities but we cant use them  the alternative from the hotel was to use the pool of their sister hotel which is where i write this review from horrendous and in no way of the same standard dont go to the sister hotel waste of you time and just adds to the frustrations the reception staff have been veryfabulous five star hotel with a central location rooms are large with every comfort food is delicious served by friendly staff facilities are excellent with an outdoor pool and bar will be back ive never really thought about going to lisbon but when my daughter was holidaying there a few weeks ago and started sending through photos and details of her experience i became intrigued and booked a long weekend  the one palacio de anunciada was an absolute joy  around 25 mins drive from the

feels grand yet intimate modern yet at the same time has an oldfashionedits amazing new renovated 5 stars hotel in the middle of lissabon we use the pool outside after coming 2 flights from 600 to 1200 from germany  to relax and went 4 hours later to explore the capital in the early evening  you can organize the transfer  fromto the the airport  over the concierge of the hotel for us it was very nice to get our guide  over the same service  the breakfast is very delightful  dont miss it location is great  hotel deluxe rooms are ok  no view  not worth the price and their reservation process over the phone is not good i called them directly booked 3 rooms  for  3 nights and i didnt get any reward despite the fact that they didnt have to pay a commision to booking or any  other plateform first and last time therei was very pleased with my stay in this hotel  the service was very personal and brilliant  the location is perfect for walking the center  bed rooms were very comfy and so clean witch was amazing  the only down fall is that there wasnt a lot of sun beds at the pool   but would definitely stay in this hotel again  we received an outstanding welcome by the front of house staff this is a beautifully appointed hotel with all the amenities and services you can expect from a true 5 star hotel located on a quiet street just behind the main shopping avenueits a pure pleasure to visit this hotel highend experience starting from the entrance beautiful room huge bed and the best possible linen the service staff were really experienced and took all possible measures needed during the times of pandemic the pool at the top is something to die for our stay at the one palacio was wonderful the hotel is beautiful very clean and centrally located the service was exceptional and the entire staff was friendly and helpful especially rafael we were celebrating our honeymoon and they welcomed us with a beautiful cake and champagne in our room as well as welcome cocktails we would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would stay here again ourselves thank youwe stayed in one of the suite and had such a lovely time this hotel is beautifully designed extremely well located and clean the staff is amazing they truly look after you  mario was very helpful and took great care of us  this hotel is perfect for a romantic gateway we loved every minute of it and cant wait to come back thank you to the whole team for making this very special stay better than we could have imaginedfirst impression of the hotel was excellent we arrived an hour early to check in and they accommodated us in a beautiful clean room the service at check in and particularly the concierge lucas was wonderful everyone very chatty happy and couldnt help you enough the location is perfect we were able to walk to all of the tourist attractions in less than half an hour the outdoor pool is beautiful and gets the sun until 67 oclock great to chill after a day of sightseeing and the wine barterrace is a lovely setting for a drink 1010 hotel highly recommend best city centre hotel i have stayed ingreat hotel with lovely rooftop pool service is fantastic and location perfect to explore lisbon room with a garden view was clean and has everything you need the beds are very comfy would recommend having breakfast in the garden which has a lovely setting and the service is greatperfect location and beautiful room the staff is exceptional and the amenities are everything youd need or want  as shown in the photo the room is spotless tastefully decorated in a calming way and there is zero city noise coming into the roomthe hotel is beautiful but service is lackluster apparently the staff doesnt like management and it shows was extremely disappointed  will not go back we went with another couple and their room was 100 euro less than ours and they refuse correct also not all rooms have a mirror never heard ofwonderful experience overall mainly because of the great attentions received from staff members like karla martha lucas mario ricardo raphael beatriz  so so caring miguel  so precise paolo  incredible human being samuelson antonio raphaela vera nina and other members of the team we can confirm well come back to lisbon and therefore to the one palacio de anunciada we do believe solange at reception could increase her level of kindness to keep up with the standard of the rest of the team last but not least we want to say that helio the manager is excellentamazing location exceptional service and beautiful facilities  couldnt recommend this hotel more only 2 people are allowed in the spa at one time during covid but its easy to book and there was plenty of availability the outdoor pool is a real highlight \n",

            "Paragraph:    great hotel with beautiful interior it has a burlesque atmosphere which is great for couples we stayed at bondage room which was  big enough and with big bed breakfast is good we suggest to go to cabaret show with dinner food is great and the show is even betterim not saying this hotel was bad its just that it promised so much more than it provided and let itself down in little ways that really could have been avoided for example when we arrived quite late in the evening we were led that there was a private party in the bar so we couldnt use it could we pop in and take a drink up to our room no could we get her room service brought up no but we could listen to the private partys music in our room for the rest of the night the next afternoon they had ticketed dinnershow events in the bar area so once again it was of limits we were also told that only the first nespresso in the room would be free although this may have been a miscommunication other disappointments were the room being small and almost devoid of anyweve had a very pleasant stay at maxime hotel at the end of february the reception staff were always helpful the breakfast had plenty of cold and hot options a lot of fruits pastry plenty of teajuice and coffees the room was very pleasant and very well decorated in terms with the hotel theme bathroom was quite spotless quite a main check that many hotels fail nowadays bed was very comfy and large enough for two people to stretch fully and barely reach themselves short to none distance to a main street which offers transport and shops all over the placewe stayed in the maxime hotel for two nights and we enjoyed every moment of it the location is perfectthe staff is kind and humble the service is over expectedthe hotel has a unique design and the rooms are renovated and modern the breakfast was really good with a choice for any diet i strongly recommend this hotel while visiting lisbonthis swanky sexy motif hotel was a perfect stay to celebrate my boyfriends birthday we checked in and the staff was friendly and warm  when we entered our room we were greeted with balloons chocolates champagne  and birthday cake including a candle the extra touches and smiles made our stay the lounge was fun the drinks were awesome and vibe was upbeat  unfortunately we missed the burlesquecabaret show next time we highly recommend this hotel for your stay convenient to train station and a 20 minute walk to all the fabulous sites restaurants and shoppingfab quirky hotel comfortable rooms with good shower and big fluffy towels  breakfast was good and great selection location was perfect walk away from everything we did have a noisy toilet but didnt spoil it  hotel surprised us with a bottlewe enjoyed our stay at the hotel the room was a little bit on the small side and although coffee was provided in the room there was no tea available breakfast was fantastic with anything you could imagine provided for you with the staff being very attentive my wife fell ill after we checked out nothing to do with the hotel and we returned back to the hotel the staff could not have been any kinder   they wanted to get the doctor and even offered to go to the pharmacy to buy the medicinewe felt that this was beyond any call of duty by the staff well done and keep up the good work we were even given complementary water and a coffee while my wife was recovering  and we were waiting for the taxi to take us to the airportvery good place for a romance escape with good location and a good vibe very good breackfast and good cleaning bad for parking cause there is no free park around the hotel and there are a few outdoor placesit would be great if it was slightly closer to the centre however it is in a very elegant road with access to almost everything public transport is available and easy to access too very close to designer stores like mk and lvgreat location staff was excellent super friendly and helpful really nice rooms and a nice terrace on the first floor all i missed in the room was a fridgethe rooms are otherwise beautiful recommendi didnt expect to be a maxime magazineakacabaret thematic hotel gladly surprise very good well located close to av liberdade and barrio alto very kind staff front desk bed and room very good ngreat decoonly a little bad the ventilation of the room before enter in with carpet you should clean and give an ambiance parfum before every guest but rest perfect breakfast also very good missing some hot dishes but all fine best at the end location decoration and staff i will definetly repeat next timea cosy theme hotel very clean breakfast was delicious very good location  a few minutes walk from many attractions the staff was very friendly and helpful they gave us lots of useful advice what to see we would definitely recommend this hoteljust got back from a great weekend in this lovely hotel fabulous decor great staff and incredibly comfortable breakfast is

sintra would highly recommend this hotelgreat stay for 3 nights at the hotel super comfortable bed and linen great hotelsupplies toiletries fun breakfast fully included  on our first night there was a fire alarm while we still rate this 5 stars a little disappointed in the lack of communication by staff it took 40 minutes for first responders to arrive during that time all hotel guests were in the street for an hour at 3 in the morning and not one hotel staff to be seen in the end guests just walked back in but no explanation it would have been a nice courtesy for this break in our night could have been acknowledged by hotelgreat base for a city break to lisbon staff friendly and helpful with planning to see the sights  breakfast was excellent  rooms nice and comfortable large bed good shower and arrival chocolates were a tasty touch  would definitely recommend this place for anyone visitingthis hotel is quite unique theme based and cute however not conducive to a 2week european travel  no closet or cabinets for clothing  a bar with 6 hangers was provided the bathroom sink was decorative and not functional for a female traveler no space for toiletries  the staff was spoton

very happy with my experience the staff was very friendly and the location was good the hotel was clean and comfortable but most of all it was fun and wacky i loved the burlesque theme which was fun

in casablanca  breakfasts are of very high quality but surpassing everything are the staff who are polite friendly informed and very very helpfulwhile the hotel is centrally located and the room offer a decent amount of amenities my experience at the brown central hotel was tainted by staffs indifference attitude i made a reservation via my amex platinum for a fullqueen bed in superior double room upon check in the staff claim i have requested a double room which i didnt once that issue was clear they ask if my husband was staying with me at the hotel that we needed 1 bed that really made me and my husband super uncomfortable considering portugal is a pretty open country after that incident i notice little things here and there that the staff never say thank you or you welcome when you

were excellent restaurant was not open in evenings  but snacks were available highly reccommendedvery well located hotel rooms fitted to a high standard and very clean it was like going into a new room every day after housekeeping had been bar excellent comfortable and not over expensive breakfast buffet again very good with a wide range of food  that was regularly refreshed we had a snack type lunch at the hotel twice with food and service being very good on both occassions a mention should be made of the quality of the staff who always have a smile answer all questions you may have with humour and honesty and who do an excellent job it is hard to think of anything about the hotel we did not like this hotel in our opinion is perfect for a city break staybrowns central was extraordinary because the staff is truly happy to see you  they carry through with immediate reactions to your odd questions like does iberian airlines hang up on you when you try to change a reservation  then they help get the issue resolved   browns central is deliberately decorated and comfortable   i do believe we will return not just to portugal but to one the three 3 browns designer hotels in lisbonthe name of this hotel says it all it really is centrally located in a great location of lisbon near many attractions i found it very easy to walk to places i needed to go to i felt safe traveling solo and staying here the hotel itself is really cute great decor and cleanliness staff is friendly and helpful the only two negative things but minor was that part of the lobby is under construction and there is a smell of paint in the lobby and you had to go outside or around a different way to get to the breakfast area also the hallways that lead to the rooms are very dimly lit and dark there are auto sensors for the lights to turn on and sometimes there is a slight delay and you cant really see too well in the hallways it can be a little bit spooky if you are a femalefor sure its central located and only a five minute walk from my office when im in lisbon but i wont be staying there again its nowhere near four star quality starting from some of the rudest front desk folks ive encountered after four nights there and checking out the only thing the front desk woman said to me was eight euros which is how much i owed in hotel fees apparently  even though it was 70 degrees out they still ran the heat all day which meant i had to open the window at night and listen to noisy streets i was told to deal with it by front desk and they dont provide fans to guests and wont change the central heat  cant say enough about the adversarial and rude folks up front id otherwise say that its a decent place for the price and the breakfastgreat stay at browns central hotel a couple of minutes walk from the metro station buses and trams a short walk away too the reception staff who greeted us were very welcoming and friendly we were offered a free welcome drink to have at our own convenience lovely clean room with everything youd need the breakfast room was excellent with hot buffet style food cereals continental meats croissants etc very polite and professional breakfastbar staff we loved the comfortable relaxed style of the loungebar area this was our first time in portugal and lisbon to celebrate my wifes birthday and browns hotel helped make it a very memorable experience wouldnt hesitate to stay here againwhile the hotel is centrally located and the room offer a decent amount of amenities my experience at the brown central hotel was tainted by staffs indifference attitude i made a reservation via my amex platinum for a fullqueen bed in superior double room upon check in the staff claim i have requested a double room which i didnt once that issue was clear they ask if my husband was staying with me at the hotel that we needed 1 bed that really made me and my husband super uncomfortable considering portugal is a pretty open country after that incident i notice little things here and there that the staff never say thank you or you welcome when you thank you for giving your key they never asked how was my stay at check out or even a simple thank you for staying with usjust returned from the browns central hotel in lisbon where me and my family stayed for 4 nights ive stayed here on two other occasions prior to this trip but i can honestly say that i wont be staying here again nor recommending to any family or friends unfortunately we arrived in lisbon under difficult circumstances as the coronavirus was starting to escalate therefore the hotel had started to put things in place to help avoid the spreading of the virus ie hand sanitizer in the reception area and dining room and asking people to only sit 2 persons to a table and at every other table on our arrival we had to wait for our room to be cleaned so we sat in the bar area having a drink we all sat around a table only for my partners son being told abruptly by a member of thewe chose this for the location but it was wonderful in every way  clean comfortable   pleasant sophisticated but not pretentious super helpful staff gave us great recommendations for restaurants fado everything  couldnt have been more delighted with our staywe had a long weekend at this hotel and it was just wonderful  we were 5th floor in a fantastic attic room  very clean and spacious  it had lots of little personal touches that you do not get in many hotels  the breakfast was good  the hotel bar staff are fabulous and very attentive  i recommend the spiced margarita  the location is very central and most areas are walkable  loved it  will stay again on our next visit to lovely lisbon they have gone all in to be a real genuine design hotel and they have successfully manged the task very fresh rooms and especial the bath with a lot of toys plenty of details and decorations but not so bigat all high standard on everything though very good location but on a very touristic street but a few streets away it calms down and thank god for that plenty of really good places to eat and drink just in the local neighborhood breakfast was decent and staff quick responsive and helpful have tried a few browns and this is at the top recomended and may returnthe location of this hotel is ideal to explore the most important attractions lisbon has to offer on foot connection to public transportation is great as well the rooms though they are quite small are beautifully decorated and have everything one needs most of all the staff at the reception were lovely and helpful for any query one might have would definitely stay there againhotel is centrally located within walking distance of almost all tourist attractions room was well equipped due to covid breakfast only served in the room at no additional charge worked all week in the cafetaria with a limited noise nuisance due to music but otherwise had a very comfy staywe stayed here for a week while in lisbon the hotel staff were all super helpful and friendly checked us in with no problems and were always there to offer a friendly greeting  our room was spectacular there was everything we needed and more to intoning broads to coffee machines   i would highly recommend staying here its within walking distance of all major tourists attractions great drinks in their bar and super comfythey cancelled our booking but still havent refunded our money 881 complete con and they dont respond to phone calls or email i appreciate times are hard but this is not on they should have someone dealing with thisbooked the hotel for a work group attending a conference at fil first trip out after the pandemic so wanted to make everyone comfortable which was achieved extremely well by browns central  rooms well equipped friendly staff decent breakfast and that free cocktail the first night went down very well  the location was great for everything including metro and bike hire from rossio squarei was here for two nights the hotel was fine small room which is normal for the area my room did have a small table which i was able to rearrange the coffee maker and lamp and use as a working desk bathroom was nice the room decorations where eclectic and kind of cute i could not figure out how to use the fender music station wifi was ok but should be secured it was open wifi tv could not receive bbc or cnn or a few other international channels but hey in lisbon there are other things to do rather than watch tv right also the door was extremely hard to open so i asked the front desk clerk and he gave me instructions which worked i opted for their breakfast one morning was nothing special for me there were some fruits and some pastries that were ok you hadin the heart of lisbon perfectly placed for all areas  this is a small stylish wellmanaged friendly hotel with wellsized and appointed comfortable rooms and efficient bathrooms  good breakfastthe staff at the brown central hotel was so nice miguel was especially so accommodating to our needs originally we had a very small room and we asked him if we could get a bigger room and he was able to make that happen the room was at the top floor and had an amazing view the room was also nicely decorated very cozy  also when i needed to print out some documents for travel the front desk staff let me use their computers to do so everyone who worked there were amazing the bar also had really good drinks and there was outdoor seating the hotel itself was in a great location right in the middle of downtown lisbon and there were so many restaurants and shops around the hotel i highly recommend this hotel and would absolutely stay here againour third time of staying and this place just gets better ideally placed in the baixa for all the sights of lisbon the hotel has marvellous modern comfortable runs cleanliness is absolutely fantastic  the beds are excellent and guaranteed to give a

staff who are polite friendly informed and very very helpfulthe location of this hotel is excellent the rooms are quite small but nicely appointed the corridors are painted black so bring a flashlight the breakfast is excellent the staff is friendly and helpful personally i would go for something with more natural light as i found this hotel too dark for my tastes its really not a good choice for children or the very elderly one poor women was completely befuddled by the clever light switches and found the black corridors very confusing as did i after a couple of drinks from the famous barvery helpful and friendly staff and great location  room was lovely  clean and well equipped  bed very comfortable no view from room as window looked out directly onto another building but at least was

breakfast sufficient and plenty we enjoyed our stay our car was parked in the garage with easy accessi had booked the room with the hotel directly instead of making the reservation via booking or other websites to help the hotel save unnecessary fees the price was the same my flight was cancelled due to coronavirus and i planned to stay a second night and made the reservation directly at the hotel my next flight was cancelled as well and i had to leave the hotel at 9am and told the manager that i did an earlier checkout because we would try to leave the country by other means we therefore left the hotel at 9am and did not make use of the second night even though informing in advance the hotel refused to refund the money of the second night a behaviour that is not understandable in the current times where all airlines hotels and intermediates refund touriststhe location is ok and the value of the stay is very good staff was very friendsly i was both in a very small and very big room perhaps good to check first if you need som espace breakfast on roof top was greatwithout being excellent this hotel is in everything at least good enough the room is spacy the balcony sufficient only the shower room is a bit small but working fine on the 7th topfloor even a nice place to enjoy your breakfastfirst the good part spotlessly clean and with ultra professional front desk ladies   so what didnt i like  well  the hotel is basically full of very noisy guests the rooms are smaller than they appear on the website and the walls very thin i dont think i slept much   there is no hotel bar where one might have a nightcap one might have concluded there was from the photos a vending machine has replaced it  i was also miffed to see the stated rate wasnt the actual rate they charge a tourist tax on top this should be included in their quotes i dont favour establishments that mislead overall little to recommend it id pay a smidge more and get something else if you care about sleepingwelcome was warm and friendly room small but clean toilet etc also clean if you want to visit lisbon this is a good location metro stations close by 2 different lines breakfast sufficient and plenty we enjoyed our stay our car was parked in the garage with easy accessbooked the hotel with bed and breakfast services the morning buffet was delicious and excellent the hotel is located close to the city with plenty of restaurants nearby the lisbon oceanarium is located within a 10 to 15 minute drive from the hotel we had a great time here spending most of our days travelling and arriving in the late evenings to what felt just like home they have great facilities providing tired tourists with elevator service that takes you to your floor where youll find your room so that you dont have to use the stairs the breakfast area has a balcony which shows a beautiful view of the surrounding area also close to the hotel is the alameda da encarnao highly recommendedthis hotel is realy nice clean with kinds personnals  this hotel is just close to city center of lisbon more over the aireport is on the same line line red easy for your first time in this city this is a nice clean hotel between the airport and the downtown lisbon the room was clean but small there is not much in the area there are 2 local restaurants that are decent and reasonably priced the alameda metro station is about a kilometer away but it is down a very steep hill so after sightseeing all day it is quite a trudge back up the best thing about this hotel is the amazing staff every one of them was very pleasant extremely helpful very caring and all spoke excellent english they are very happy to help with arranging tours making recommendations and giving directions its good value for the money but a little out of the waystayed for 5 nights at hotel dah which  is situated close to the metro stations almeda and olias that take you into the heart of lisbon however from almeda it is a steep hill climb to the hotel but it is the closest the other station is olias which is a reasonable walk if this is your first time to lisbon you might want to stay a bit closer to the action while the metro is a good price and convenient with the heat of the day i would have wanted the option to have a break at the hotel this wasnt the case for hotel dah  the hotel itself is quiet and clean and the housekeeping staff are simply amazing the reception staff are friendly and spoke good english but could have been more knowledgable about tours and activities there is a small lift available  the rooms are bigwe stayed there for almost a week and we are pleased with everything the room was clean and organized the folks at the front desk were super friendly answering all our questions and giving us directions about places etc there is a parking lot available for a modest extra fee and the breakfast was good and well presented there is also a lookout where you can combine coffee with a beautiful view the metro station is really close about 5 minutes walking  i think its a safe area because we walk late at night and there were people walking along us i would stay again if i have the opportunitystayed here two nights and couldnt be more pleased front desk folks were extremely helpful answering all questions and in one case going above and beyond to make a phone call on our behalf to straighten out a computer glitch with our toll pass  breakfast was excellent and there was ample parking underground for extra charge  the metro station was an easy walk away so we were able to enjoy everything in lisbon hassle freecleaning lady didnt lock our door we got stolen 150 manager offered us free breakfast 2p worth 18 can you imagine lucky for us we didnt get our ids stolen staff is not to blaim they did their research if the manager were in our place i wonder if he would be content by the taken measureswe chose a triple room for our family of three as reviews commented on the rooms being small the triple room was indeed spacious and we all slept extremely well despite it being on a main roadwe are very light sleepers the beds were very comfortable its possible that a double room with an extra bed would have been enough and at that price 78 it would have been incredibly good value for lisbon the room was very clean and it had a balcony where we could enjoy a beer after our child had gone up bed  the breakfast room is quite small  there is also an outdoor part which has some ok views over lisbon you can see the river the food selection was good coffee and pastries were good but the croissants looked very dry  location was good although it is an uphill trek fromwe stayed in this hotel for 15 nights the hotel is near to the metro station the front office agents horcio ana andreina susana and cyndna were so friendly hospitable and attended to our needs we left the hotel at 400 am for our flight and horcio helped us with the luggages and followed up on the transport service he was very professional though this is not a fivestar hotel the front office agents have rendered a fivestar service and we would highly recommend it to other tourists we would definitely stay there again should we visit lisbon in the futurethe location is ok and the value of the stay is very good staff was very friendsly i was both in a very small and very big room perhaps

and did not make use of the second night even though informing in advance the hotel refused to refund the money of the second night a behaviour that is not understandable in the current times where all airlines hotels and intermediates refund touristsits very basic clean and helpful but notably basic and the location that lacks the appeal of the more interesting parts of lisbon do your homework before deciding if this property is right for you it seems its best for budget sensitive backpacking guests who dont need many comforts or services and dont mind an area with few options for dining drinks or entertainment in the immediate areawe were traveling with one of our adult children and so reserved a room for three it was spotless with the amenities you would expect the room was configured in such a way that the two beds were separated somewhat for a bit of privacy the bath is modern and it has a great shower our room had a nice balcony the view was not spectacular but having the breeze was enjoyable breakfast is typical european style  hot eggs and meat assorted cold cuts and cheeses breads and croissants fruit cereal etc the staff was extremely helpful over the phone and in person recommendeda quiet and well run hotel on the edge of the city centre  easy to reach from the airport good metro links to get around the city breakfast on the terrace is a pleasure in warm weather   for those arriving from the airport however be aware it is at the top of a steep hill so make sure you are able to carry your bags the final 500600 metresbecause our airline had changed the time schedule we needed to stay over 1 night on our trip from maputo to amsterdam the hotel is appr 15 min from the airport and provides decent rooms for reasonable prices the lady at the reception was very friendly after a long day we didnt want to go out and ordered room service this was rather dissapointingthe room was a good size and bathroom was clean and basic but the lobby is tiny and no seats so we had to wait our turn standing the shower was blowing cold warm water which made it uncomfortable to shower the hotel is some distance from the downtown and with no metro station nearby metro station is a 10 minute walkhotel is located about 1015 minutes by taxi from the airport  you can get to the center of lisbon in 1015 minutes by nearby metro stops  room is simple but spacious  clean  the front desk staff is very very helpful ines horacio rosaria etc  breakfasts are complete and very tasty  this hotel is a very good valuefirst the good part spotlessly clean and with ultra professional front desk ladies   so what didnt i like  well  the hotel is basically full of very noisy guests the rooms are smaller than they appear on the website and the walls very thin i dont think i slept much   there is no hotel bar where one might have a nightcap one might have concluded there was from the photos a vending machine has replaced it  i was also miffed to see the stated rate wasnt the actual rate they charge a tourist tax on top this should be included in their quotes i dont favour establishments that mislead overall little to recommend it id pay a smidge more and get something else if you care about sleepingmy partner and i recently stayed at this hotel on a short city break to lisbon this is a clean and comfortable hotel with great transport links to the city the metro station is a 10 minute walk down the hill wasnt a problem for us but could potentially be a struggle the metro was quick and very easy to use a further 10 minutes from the hotel you can find a few restaurants and bars if you wanted to stay closer to the hotel in the evening which were also much cheaper good for a place to crash after a busy day exploringwithout being excellent this hotel is in everything at least good enough the room is spacy the balcony sufficient only the shower room is a bit small but working fine on the 7th topfloor even a nice place to enjoy your breakfastalthough this hotel is a bit out of the way from the city centre it is not too far from the transit system a few minutes walk and you are right on the subway and on your way to wherever your heart desires  the room was a delight and offered a lovely vista especially in the breakfast area speaking of breakfast the staff member was always on hand with yet another goodie to add to the already huge selection but still managed not to get underfoot when clients were enjoying the morning meal  all in all i would highly recommend this hotel and would return again myself if ever i visit lisbon againsmall hotel in good location with recently refurbished rooms ideal as a base and very helpful staff good local restaurants within a few minutes walk and ten minutes from the airport by taxi or by hotel transferlove the fact that 2 yrs later when i return it was the same staff tells you they treat their people right rooms are comfortable and not bad on price local food and grocery store as well as places for a dinner all within a 2 block walkwe felt very welcome at checkin we turned up early and were given a map and shown some good places to visit the website we booked at gave us a twin room but we were offered a swap to a double for the next night which was very nice the hotel is very reasonable priced and definitely worth it it is not located close to the city but there are 2 metro stops very close to the hotel so it is easy to travel in to explore would recommend this place if you are just looking for a bed for the night so you can explore in the day \n",

            "stayed for a short city break  the hotel is a 1015 metro to the central for the eiffel tower and 5 minute taxi to notre dame  we did expect it to be quite far out but were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get to all the usual sites so if you are looking for something a little quieter away from the centre hustle and bustle this is perfect  this hotel is a bit diy with complimentary tea and coffee and a serve yourself breakfast with fresh pastries ham pancakes and boiled eggs  perfect start to a long days sightseeing  the hotel decor is qwerky cool and classy whilst the rooms are cosey and just right for a short stay  staff were more than happy to accommodate our request of a balcony over looking the city roof tops and flowers as a surprise for my partner  thejust stayed 2 nights in this hotel and i loved its simplicity style location staff room lounge area and breakfast the only thing i was a little disappointed in was the small selection of food on our arrival back from the first day tired and hungry there was a small selection of wholesome snacks as they dont have cooking facilities and the food has to be preorderedwe saw others eating it and it looked delicious  again wholesome and home made i hesitate in recommending it as it is a jewel in a sea of expensive and crapy parisienne hotels strangely the staff were lovely all of them an achievement in paris where redness seems to be norm braviits pretty obvious the vast majority of reviews of this hotel on the internet are written by the management at first it comes off as chic in an odd way but then its clear its more about marketing than the hotel itself there are even weird signs everywhere encouraging guests to post photos on social media with the message be a good part of the community   true the room are cute like many boutique hotels its designed to look like a nice apartment rather than a hotel the bed is also more comfortable than most hotel beds however i was shocked when i arrived because the room was by far the smallest of any hotel room ive ever stayed in you have about one meter on either side of the bed and half that in front of it the door to the toilet doesnt even fully open thiswe absolutely loved our stay at coq hotel all the cute carefully considered little details extremely comfy bed pleasing shower and beautiful big window with a french balcony were just some reasons why we absolutely fell in love with this hotel it made our stay in paris even more memorable3we loved everything about our stay  the hotel is beautifully decorated and very stylish the room amenities are good including lovely toiletries and everything you need for a short stay the service was great  warm and welcoming and it is well located for metro lineswe had a brilliant stay at this hotel on our long weekend to paris it is really well decorated we loved our room massive comfy bed huge shower gorgeous carpet all very much to our tastes we got a really good deal that include a welcome drink which included a few glasses of good wine and super yummy popcorn the location is good near place ditalie so walkable to the left bank breakfast was fabulous really good quality produce the bread and butter was to die for lovely staff too we loved our stay so much we even bought a bottle of their wine as a souvenirwould definitely recommend had a room with a balcony overlooking paris rooftops breakfast is fantastic lots of choice of high quality products decor was modern and trendy and rooms were excellent sizeits hard to find enough superlatives for this hotel right from the check in to the check out we were greeted by friendly and smiling staff the room was small  as expected in paris  but with a reasonably large and nice bathroom everything was in good condition the breakfast was great not the biggest selection but quality items slightly cramped at times  a little wait for a table to be expected nice location in relation to metro lines and the neighborhood seemed peaceful and quiet and then i have to mention that several times we saw the staff go glass  knives and forks etc through to make sure it was perfectly clean  as it was at a michelin starred restaurant would love to stay here again another timewe stayed at the coq hotel for 4 nights in mid may it was as good as the photos and reviews suggest stylish but not pretentious friendly helpful service and a substantial breakfast   we upgraded to the superior room for extra space staying in such a special place we looked forward to coming back to the 13 arrondissement every evening after long days sightseeing in the citythis is without doubt one of the best located hotels we have stayed at in paris location is perfect for walking five minutes from metro with multiple lines converging so no part of paris is out of reach staff are wonderful along with very well maintained and clean premises could not be faultedthis is a lovely hotel the rooms are charming in a minimalist way clean and with plenty of natural light the rooms have windows that can be opened the hotel has an intimate feel yet there is plenty of public space to relax or do work its location close to the place ditalie provides good access to public transport and the staff were helpful in providing information on how to get around the staff are friendly energetic polite wellinformed and speak some english the 24 hour availability of light food options and a machine for tea and coffee is especially welcome the breakfast options are good and the staff accommodated my dietary needs punctually and without fuss  i had an extended stay for work and would certainly stay again this is a gem of a placewe loved this hotel and would highly recommend it for its friendly staff comfortable beds lovely rooms and amazing breakfasts very relaxed and comfortable and well placed in terms of metro station a place ditalie we paid for a larger room which is not so big but this is paris and for the price we paid the size and atmosphere of the room was very fair very large and comfortable bed the bathroom had a bad but no separate shower parking is easy in the neighbourghood and if you like to park in a paid garage prices are 14th the price of more central parisi thoroughly enjoyed my 3night stay at coq hotel in a quieter part of paris conveniently located nearby the place ditalie station with 3 metro lines  the classique room size is standard for paris hotels  it is the thoughtful use of space and design that actually makes staying at this hotel a truly pleasant experience equally the staff were very welcoming and always willing to help delivering quality service  the breakfast at the hotel is lovely and there are also some good food options in the 13eme arr for dinner nearby after a day out  overall an excellent stay i highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting paris and looking to have a standout boutique hotel experiencei was stuck in paris as there was a rail strike and needed a nice place to sit and wait until i was picked up i was looked after immediately upon walking through the door celia was an absolute star the lounge area is to the right of the reception and is cool contemporary and elegant i had the house wine which at 18 euros a bottle was well priced i also had the meat and cheese board for 15 euros which easily fed two adults with loads left over really generous the staff could not have been more friendly they were both fantastic i forget the other guys name but he was amazing too it was so lovely that i returned on the following thursday on the way back to orly and had a few coffees there i adore this hotel and will absolutely be back as soon as im able tothis hotel had everything that you might expect from a 5 star hotel in terms of service helpfulness and atmosphere at the hotel   the place felt like a home away from home with the welcime drink on offer and the boardgames the music was perfect and promoted a wonderfully relaxed ambience i would definitely come againwhat i like the staff overall atmosphere of the hotel and location if metro works bit remarks when there is a metro strike a bit far from centre of paris

owned by 2 sugar heirswhose designers had a clever concept   community of quality [coq  rooster]  highlighting quirky decor and chickens that got lost when the hotel became a cash machine for the owners new upscale venture    i am genuinely fond of the staff who try their best  staff turnover has been significant an reallocated and it shows  the mascot pet silky chickens are dead 1 or rehomed 3  the flea market decor remains but the cool clientele is vanishing  the community of quality concept exists largely in merchandising and graphics  during the week photo and film shoots often  leave guests with nowhere to sit at weekend breakfast you can struggle tole coq hotel is located in the 13th district of paris an up and coming neighborhood just steps away from the place ditalie metro station from which you can easily access all the top sites in paris  the hotel lobby has a chic modern decor with velvet sofas cool artworks and interesting coffee table books giving it the air of a stylish cocktail bar theres even a sitting area full of plants and glass skylights which feels like a parisian glass menagerie and sitting room around a cozy fireplace breakfast is a sumptuous spread of fresh baguettes croissants configures fruit yogurt cheeses and meats served in the airy dining room at the front of the lobby the hotel has an elevator which for those of us me included that cant seem to leave home without a giantwe throughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy spot close to the 5  6 train if you are comfortable using the metro we are new yorkers then this is the hotel for you about a 1015 minute train ride to all the major attractions and very easy to transfer to the airport bound trains we loved the design of the hotel very chic very clean and super friendly staff i left my adapter at home and they were kind enough to let me borrow one you saved me from an awful hair day thank you they also do a complimentary glass of wine from 6pm8pm and have a coffee station that you can use anytime of day stay here you wont regret itfantastic hotel uber cool furnishings and vibe  location not as central but certainly worth the extra journey time to enjoy it staff were welcoming and friendly breakfast and drinks were superb enjoyed the experience (Score: 0.4586)\n",

            "my wife and i spent 4 nights at this hotel which is located just a short walk from the gare de lyon train station and just steps from the bastille round about our room was in the back facing a side street and it was very quiet the metro has lines just steps away plus many good restaurants we ate at le coq rico in the monmartre a la biche au bois two blocks away au temps des cerises just on the marais border and les coquettes de christian constant close to eiffel all of these restaurants offer terrific food at reasonable prices the room at pavillon bastille had a small coolerand available coffee and teathere is a large grocery about 1 12 blocks toward the train stationthe entire hotel was clean and well taken care of breakfast in the basement was also very goodvery reasonably priced hotel that is wellkept booked directly on site and received free breakfast cant complain about the bedroom and bathroom  comfortable and clean  its located very close to bastille station 5 minute walk and possibly a 15 minute walk to gare de lyon if you are driving it is conveniently located in front of opera house parking stationthis hotel was a nice surprise after having spent many nights in noisy andor uncomfortable paris hotels a small place just off the place de la bastille and lots of activity the hotel is surprisingly quiet with low internal traffic ie hallway chatter the rooms come with whatever you need from a clothesline in the bath to a minibar the staff is very accommodating and friendly and the morning breakfast is yummy and plentiful plus the coffee machine is ready to provide whatever you like from an espresso to a big cup of classic coffee i will certainly return mercithe best bit of this hotel is the staff  very friendly helpful especially since we arrived during a rail strike special thanks go to indural  who organised taxi transport back to cdg when the rotten sncf were on strike and there were no trains our room was in a perfect position  top floor at the end so noone next door to disturb us our room was also facing a side street so we had no traffic noise we did not have breakfast as all hotels charge far too much so we went to a local cafe which was only five minutes away we had a good selection of tv programmes  cnn bbc world and a few french sports programmes the hotel is in an ideal place for metro bars restaurants and visiting the local area would stay there again in an instanta nice hotel in a typical old french area of paris close to the center very comfortable and simple room in an old building flowered a really discret and friendly ambiance a great place to visit pariscant fault the location staff are welcoming and helpful and the rooms are clean with pleasant lighting the beds are as small as they come comfortable enough and it means a bit more floor space for the suitcases great to have a kettle in the room as well as coffee facilities in reception would stay againthe room was very nice and clean  however we had the desk call us a taxi on the morning of 1082021 and the driver charged us 421 to go to beauvais airport  we did expect to pay about 150 because of what we had researched but this was definitely wrong  i hope they dont continue  calling this taxi companyvery clean and tidy place is reasonably priced especially for the time of year tour de france good location where you can easily get to locations by half hour to fourth five minute walk or public transport 5 mins away beds are comfortable breakfast was average for a buffetif the prices were higher for this small chic hotel it would be called a boutique hotel but the news here is that it is everything that boutique hotels are but without the crazy prices   our double room was nicely decorated with a super comfortable bed and sleek bed covers and soft go to sleep pillows easy access wifi was a huge plus  as were the hefty towels in the bathroom which were lovely after a hot shower caveat  the hair dryer is a little strange so if thats important you might bring your own travel hair dryer    the staff speaks english and could not have been nicer when our flight was cancelled we called from the airport and the front desk was very accommodating about just giving us our same room   breakfast comes with the room  also a big plus  soeverything you would expect from a threestar hotel good central location being a couple of minutes from the metro station room clean and good size for paris hotel with comfortable bed and good quality linen excellent buffet breakfast with fresh croissant and pastries we will use this hotel

during the metro strikes so did not take advantage of it overall a very pleasant staywe spent 3 nights here on a recent visit to paris the hotel was easily accessed from the metro from our arrival point on the eurostar with only a short stroll from bastille metro stop the lady at reception when we arrived was warm and friendly and thankfully fluent in english as our french was very limited we found the room small but more than adequate for a couple who were there only to sleep the bed was very comfortable ensuring a restful sleep and the room cleaned daily with a safe in the room we felt confident that passports and credit cards were safely left there we did not have breakfast at the hotel so unable to comment on this the price did however seem quite reasonable particularly when considering the cost of meals in paris it needs to be noted that thevery convenient place for stay in paris excellent access to any transport nice staff quiet rooms good start point to discover galeries historic buildings or follow the life in streets from typical cafswe had a very enjoyable couple of nights staying in this hotel the bed was very large and comfortable and the breakfast selection was brilliant it is very well located for visiting paris and would definitely recommendwatch out if you stay here as my sister and i had money stolen from a locked bag in our hotel room not a good start to our holiday   otherwise it is a fairly standard hotel in a good location close to the gare de lyonthe hotel has clean rooms a good and rich breakfast the rooms were a bit small but it

at opera bastillewe had a great experience staff of the hotel was friendly the rooms were clean and comfortable and the price was rightto top it off the hotel was on walking distance of the city centre at least for uswe had an overnighter here after finishing our 3 week cycle tour of southeastern france  the location was handy for getting cross town to gare du nord for our return leg  staff were friendly and couldnt really fault the room for a short stay  we might have been more forgiving due to our many nights under canvas on the bicycling tour   hotel has a useful side ramp for wheeled access to the lobby and a nice little gated outdoor area at the front   price was reasonable for paris and it was pretty much a standard type hotel  weve stayed in better and worse in our dozen or so visits to the cityfriendly nice little hotel clean budget about 100 eur per night are the first words coming to mind it is perfectly located at walking distance from bastille subway etc and also very close to the train station gare de lyon i walked there without problem  the room with 2 twin beds was spacious quiet thanks to good windows isolation a little noise from people passing through the corridor though with confortable bed simple but nice decoration and goodcreanfunctional bathroom the staff was very nice 24h   make sure to book directly from their website as the price is the same than other portals but more importantly they offer breakfast if you book with their site worth it to save a few bucks for a good and complete breakfast the croissants were to die formy husband and i stayed in this hotel for 8 nights on the first leg of our trip to europe in  september of 2019  we thought the hotel was very nice yes the rooms were a bit small but we did not feel cramped at all we had plenty of room for the little bit of time we spent in the room  we were surprised how quiet the area was  and we had a room facing rue de lyon it was very close to the bastille metro stop from where you could get everywhere after 8 days of riding the metro all over in paris we became very familiar with the system  the room and bathroom were very clean the bed and pillows comfortable we had very restful nights after exploring paris  we did not get the breakfast  as we wanted to go out and explore options for breakfast so i can not comment on (Score: 0.4237)\n",

            "the hotel is on a small beautiful unknown square right next to the cnam on the right bank close to grand boulevard st martin areas and super accessible from the gare du nord or montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as the best location clean and amazing staff it not fussy but to an elegant high standard it makes your trip feel wonderful and special i visit and recommend to everyone as it makes your paris trip even more perfectcomfortable nicely designed rooms   we had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing cuts out the traffic noise no kettle in room but they were very happy to send up a pot of boiling water for us to make tea excellent breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff close to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station

breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my

hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back (Score: 0.4042)\n",

            "we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of august 19 location is 510 minutes walk from the eiffel towerand plenty of nice bars and restaurants yet the hotel itself is very quiet and relaxing after a long day of site seeing very pricey area though so be prepared to spend 100 on a meal in the evening for two hotel was a small compact boutique that offers bed and breakfast waking up to the smell of fresh croissant was a win friendly staff at reception room was very small however for a short city break for 2 this was just fine price was no different from 3 nights at a premier inn in the uk would recommendi highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was very clean pretty the beds were very comfortable and the most important is the location youre going to be in the safest and most beautiful neighborhood in paris liliana mendozawe chose this hotel due to its excellent location  right next to the trocadero and short walks to the tour eiffel and arc de triomphe it is well positioned for a short city break  30mins from gard du nord on the metro  the facilities provided were good  clean room comfy bed ensuite  i was surprised though at what was not included in the room wifi is available but costs extra tea and coffee facilities are in reception not the room and again there is a charge there was a safe but no key provided  i assumed it similarly cost extra but may be wrong  so 35 because those things i would expect as standard were not provided without additional payment other than that it is a nice hotel in an excellent locationperfect location perfect friendly personal parking lot to reserve nearby good continental breakfast clean nice and good restaurant in neighborhood location also in very nice neighborhood tres bienthe hotel is near the trocadero place one of the best place to see the eiffel tower near the chaillot palace near also le muse des monuments franais le muse de la marine  its very well locatedwe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel very nice staff clean hotel  rooms very cute and instagrammable patio perfect location as usual we booked for the dinner which is always amazing and tasty cant wait to come back and thanks to the teamwe were forced to cancel our trip due to the pandemic and hotel longchamp was the only accommodation that would not work with us on obtaining a refund or even letting us change our dates to one year later they did offer us to pay a change fee to change our dates a few months later but didnt offer this until less then one week before our planned stay which was too late to coordinate with the rest of our already rescheduled trip hotel longchamp had ignored all communication with us when trying to deal with this in a timely manner our experiences with all our other various flight and hotel reservations etc really worked with us to refund or move our dates to a later time that all syncs up all in the same trip for this reason i cannot recommend this hotel they find any reasoni highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was very clean pretty the beds were very comfortable and the most important is the location youre going to be in the safest and most beautiful neighborhood in paris liliana mendozaperfect location perfect

hotel for 2 nights on holiday on arrival we left our bags as we were before the room was ready and on return our bags were put into our room and coats hung up in the wardrobe which was great the hotel room was a great size bathroom where toilet is a little small but great room and the beds so comfy we were able to add breakfast on the morning if we wanted when we woke up and the staff were really friendly as we didnt know paris very well the reception member got the map and identified all the main tourist attractions the two metro stations which the hotel is between and also gave us some great restaurants to visit which helped up a lot throughout the few days we stayed would highly recommend staying herewe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel

a review since we are so happy with this hotel it really lived up to the expectations that we had it is just as fresh as in the pictures friendly staff and central location recommend itmy stay in the hotel was unforgettable the rooms are very private and clean the bathroom is very neat as well the staff was friendly and welcoming makes me feel like home is near to trocadero so you can go a enjoy the view of the beautiful eiffel towerclean rooms friendly staff really feels like home  breakfast is nice everything is fresh and delicious  reception is at your service 247 and that is great  one disadvantage  you can hear the noise in the hall while being in your roomi have chosen this hotel several times and will certainly stay there again it has an excellent location both for touristic and business trips the rooms are clean and comfortable the hotel staff is very attentive and helpfulhotel is in a great location staff was pleasant and helpful rooms are very tight standard double end bed was literally less than a foot from the wall no floor space to open your bags carpet in room and stairwell is kinda old dark and not clean looking stairwells seemed darkrecently stayed here with my family i have a young baby and was still made to feel welcome which has been a problem when travelling previously  great location nice clean hotel i would definitely recommendmy family stayed in a triple room 2 adults 1 child at this lovely little hotel and loved it  the location could not be beat it was a few minute walk to the metro and only a couple more to the eiffel tower the hotel staff was so kind and nice the breakfast each morning was very tasty and the room was a good size for our family when we return to paris we will definitely stay here againthe area was good for restaurants and close to metro station the problem came when they stated that the room was handicapped accessible not even the entry was accessible there were stairs and a smaller than average doorways the bathroom was very small and the toilet room was so small that not only the door would not open farther than 13 of the way but you had to straddle the toilet to close the door the biggest problem was that the room was too small i know that paris has small rooms but this was like a closet i am not exaggerating there was also construction so ask if there still is any as it was very loudvery nice staff shout out to edris and brightaquad room was nice 4 sistersfirst time in parisand clean location couldnt be betterwalking distance to the eiffel tower and other tourist spots easily accessible by bus or metrotrainhighly recommenced as we will surely stay here again next time we visit parislocation 1010 the administration 1010 we were absolutely happy in this hotel hope to come back here again and again  i dont know what else to say so im writing something to tripadviser   good bey see u soonmyself and my partner are a young couple who had a very pleasant experience on our visit to paris on easter weekend we experienced the wonderful paris friday traffic jams lol when we arrived we received a warm welcome from the lovely man at reception it was quick he gave us a map with all the locations and told us the nearest metro station stayed in room 504 was a nice room my only criticism is that control of the aircon should be done from the room as i had to ask the receptionist but that was no bother as we did this when left in the morning to then come back to a very cool room as the weather was amazing and very hot i certainly would recommend this hotel for its location and the cafes  restaurant are just amazing thank you hotel longchamp elyseesi first stayed here in 1984 and when it came time to visit again with my wife we did so this spring  the hotel is a small family affair where the front desk and other staff know you by name after the first night  it is close to two metro lines and within walking distance to the bois de bologne champs elysees eiffel tower trocodero museums and more and there are many good restaurants bistros chinese sushi portuguese patisseries the accommodations are first rate and the amenities are superior  looking forward to visiting again and soonmy husband and i stayed here for our ruby wedding anniversary and it is a fab hotel centrally situated near the eiffel tower and just a short walk from larc de triomphe metro station just a few minutes walk from hotel the staff here are so nice and really helpful we would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to paris bernie  patsywe had a great four night stay at hotel longchamp elysees the staff was very welcoming and willing to assist from the moment we arrived arriving on a saturday we had concerns about the protest but they immediately pulled out a map and explained areas we should avoid the rooms were on the smaller size  to be expected but were clean and well kept planning to be out for the majority of the day and returning late at night we were a little hesitant that we had to leave our hotel key at the desk but there was always someone there when we arrived back at night the location was great to easily travel by metro and the staff was more than willing to accommodate holding our luggage on our last day would certainly recommendnice hotel in paris france near the eiffel tower  great staff very helpful  room was small but comfortable and safe  no refrigerator in the room but europe doesnt usually provide refrigerators in rooms anyway  very small hotel but near many cafes metro and sightseeing  best hotel we stayed in during our tripi generally do not write poor reviews however i would not stay here again at all no lift to the room as you can see by the spiral staircase photos no offer of assistance to the room with baggage for my 70yr parents walls paper thin i could here kids yelling at all hours the ac is not controlled by you in your room the door key had to be left with front desk for the day its 2019 invest in proper doors locks the male at the front desk clerk was extremely rude  camille you were lovely and tried to make up but at some point you have to cut your losses  the food for breakfast what food eggs not cooked 2 baguettes small pieces of cheese a feeble pieces of ham etc disappointing decent location the eiffel tower was close and that is the best i can say for thislong champs elysees hotel is great exceeded my expectations few walks to restaurants grocery stores and to eiffel where it is great to see at night breakfast is great chooses are many hotel size is good bathroom is really spacious  hotel has mini english garden to smoke eat has concierge service that keeps your belongings safely hotel is clean  quiet   certainly will recommend to friends and family (Score: 0.3947)\n",

            "the hotel is on a small beautiful unknown square right next to the cnam on the right bank close to grand boulevard st martin areas and super accessible from the gare du nord or montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as the best location clean and amazing staff it not fussy but to an elegant high standard it makes your trip feel wonderful and special i visit and recommend to everyone as it makes your paris trip even more perfectcomfortable nicely designed rooms   we had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing cuts out the traffic noise no kettle in room but they were very happy to send up a pot of boiling water for us to make tea excellent breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff close to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placethe little palace hotel as its

to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsthis hotel was a great little find close to everything staff were amazing and very helpful hotel room was small but very clean and comfortable breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my

would love to stay there againthis is the second time we stayed in this hotel and we were again very satisfied location and service are very good from the gare de lest you can easily walk to the hotel  as last time we had a room to the inner court that was very calmgreat place to visit paris clean romantic rooms amazing staff good breakfastbuffet love this place 5stars this hotel is close to gare du nord train and metro on walking distance a lot of restaurants surrounding the hotel even a great market with oysters and wines a supermarket next to the hotelwithin walking distance of the gare du nord in a road appropriately called the street of small hotels the hotel frontage is very small  so is the rest of it  tall and narrow built around a small courtyard rooms are small but well equipped and the breakfast buffet is  by french standards at least  quite reasonable scrambled eggs bacon and sausage very helpful staff at receptioni spent three nights in this well located hotel  the team was warm and really helpful also sanitizer and masks are available for customers  the room was of decent size for a hotel downtown top notch quality matress  i highly recommend this hotelstylish and warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in paris and needed to hit the sights prior to our check in time and the reception staff at the hotel were very friendly and allowed us to store our case until we came back to the hotel later that evening we also had use of the

itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water pressure i got in the shower its the

made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord near the first day lunch placebrasserie flodere and easy to get elsewhere just lovely helpful staff which makes all the difference  nothing too much trouble and super friendly also great breakfast

            "stayed for 4 nights at lumieres monmartre and had a pleasant enjoyable experience staff are helpful and polite and speak english well  the rooms are modern very clean and cozy and there is minimal noise from the street outside the nearest metro station is around 10 mins walking and links to anywhere in the city  there is no installed air conditioning but rooms have fans that are quiet and keep you cool on warm days  would not hesitate to book here againnice clean modern rooms small but to be expected in pairs shop across the road cute restaurant s and bakery nearby  not too far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus

mohammad was just awful my friends and i went out for a night out and had to go wait outside for 20 minutes because of a sleeping mohammad he came to the door with his shirt wrinkled and looking super sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed and empty which was a complete lie the safe was open he hung up abruptly without giving me further information super sketchy and unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for

not so convincingly told me the safe was closed and empty which was a complete lie the safe was open he hung up abruptly without giving me further information super sketchy and unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back (Score: 0.2157)\n",

boutique property with the world class service of the most elite properties  its meteoric rise in the tripadvisor rankings is well deserved i will miss the warm and genuine greetings from front desk

            "when arriving to the area it felt a little dangerous however the hostel is 2min away from gare du nord so it was easy to find   regarding the hospitality  amazing the receptionist were so helpful and gave us all the information we needed  as for mr barry best bartender ever gave us good recommendations and also made our last nights at the st christophers inn super fun   thank you so much st christophers inn for this experience   loisthe hostel was so nice a beautiful location with a lot of stores and restaurants they organize a lot of fun things to do so you can meet a lot otlf other tourists and have fun the service was so great especially from barry    barry is amazingan amazing hostel with a nice program every night this night there was a really great wine and an amazing cheese pallet served by the amazing barry 333  barry is truely great he is so nice im just typing this because i have to fill the 200 characters  but he rlly is greatbarry is the best bartender ever and the hostel is nice everything is clean and the beds are nice  the only thing is that you have to bring your own padlock to lock your suitcase so remember to bring that didnt get to try the food just go herebarry made my night cant recommend enough i cant get into specifics even though trip advisor requires 200 character which is annoying by the way i as an irish american from new york i was honored to meet a real irish person in the beautiful city of parisbarry is the best bartender in paris cheers great bar the food was amazing drinks have good prices and they atmosphere is always great music is good and you always meet new and nice people come to belushis gare du nord asap beautiful hostel with nice people and a cool atmosphere barry made the cheese and wine night a very pleasant experience i would definitely recommend staying here if you want to visit the city pariswe had the absolute pleasure of being served by an incredible irish bartender by the name of barry he was great for recommending drinks and had a great spirit made my holiday in paris great craic altogethergreat atmosphere in the bar fantastic staff  was lucky to be served by the excellent barry on our first night in the bar he made our night staff were very accommodating checking in and the hostel is very clean and in a great locationthe hostel is super fun they organize different activities for you to get to know other people also the staff is incredibly friendly and create a great atmosphere especially barry he made our stay even more enjoyable with his kindness and hospitality good food good location special regards to my friend barry the barman very very nice 100 recommended  nevertheless tripadvisor obliges me to write 200 words as minimum wich is bloody ridiculousprivate room is extremely satisfactory great location in the city with ease of access to all amenities coming from the uk we find it hard to communicate in french but the bartender barry gave us many suggestions on the local area and made our stay at the bar a great night hats off to him for great servicei usually like hostels as they are more affordable and social compared to hotels a tradeoff in comfort is part of the deal  unfortunately this hostel was not for me the signiture barnightclub of st christophers inn is located at the hart of the hostel giving al rooms with a courtyard view entertainmant throuought the night good if you like to party the night away but not if you just want a decent nights sleep  additionally i was grossed out by my pillows even though they had clean cassings the verry sharp sweat odor was unbearable   not my best hostel experiencewonderful hostel everythings clean and the people are so nice even in a 10 bed room very good to stay there  especially the barkeeper barry made us feel welcome and made sure everyone was socializing well  also the train station is 2 minutes away which was very good when ill go to paris next time i know where im gonna stayi have only had the pleasure of spending one night at the st christophers inn but i have had so much fun and made so many friends  if you are looking for parisian nightlife this is the place to go   we were given a free workshop on making mojitos by barry it was so awesome  i would recommend this hostel to any students traveling on a budget looking to have some funwe really enjoyed our recent stay at st christophers inn the hostel was perfect for our needs and located close to the train station one of the highlights of our stay in paris was an evening spent in the adjoining bar where our fellow irishman  barry made sure the drink was flowing and everyone was in good form i would definitely recommend this hostel and bar  ive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems to take it as an argument for the bathrooms to be uncleaned showers and toilets were not clean corridors have no end and you have to pass multiple doors from the elevator to finally get to your room i felt like i was sleeping in a warehouse there was no air con and some people had problems with their windows that would not open good to mention that gare du nord is a crappy neighborhoodsuch a good vibe at the hostel a perfect place to meet new people and socialise  easy when bartender barry is on the job making sure everyone is having fun and never an empty glass i can only recommend this place to all travelling by yourself or with a friendamazing staff and customer service the trip was amazing the customer service was amazing you are greeted at reception by lovely staff and the atmosphere as amazing  5 star would defo about visit againparry the irish was great he taught us how to make mojitos and made us feel very welcome here we met lots of people from around the world and there was just a really great vibe inside the bar with all the other travelers we hope to go to stchristophers inn in other countrieswhen we made a reservation and went to the hotel they said that it was impossible for us to pay cash and that was the procedure  another customer who was there asked to pay to help us and we were going to give him cash  but the woman at the reception said very harshly that such a thing was not possible it was our last day in paris or even in france  we were in a panic and they were never helpful  they were very rude  they took cash payment for the two people who came after us but they told us it was impossible the rudest owner people i have ever seen i am so unhappy that they made our last night so bad  i will never step foot in here againive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems

montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as the best location clean and amazing staff it not fussy but to an elegant high standard it makes your trip feel wonderful and special i visit and recommend to everyone as it makes your paris trip even more perfectcomfortable nicely designed rooms   we had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing cuts out the traffic noise no kettle in room but they were very happy to send up a pot of boiling water for us to make tea excellent breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff close to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placethe little palace hotel as its

breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights

breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my home\n",

nord in a road appropriately called the street of small hotels the hotel frontage is very small  so is the rest of it  tall and narrow built around a small courtyard rooms are small but well equipped and the breakfast buffet is  by french standards at least  quite reasonable scrambled eggs bacon and sausage very helpful staff at receptioni spent three nights in this well located hotel  the team was warm and really helpful also sanitizer and masks are available for customers  the room was of decent size for a hotel downtown top notch quality matress  i highly recommend this hotelstylish and warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in paris and needed to hit the sights prior to our check in time and the reception staff at the hotel were very friendly and allowed us to store our case until we came back to the hotel later that evening we also had use of the comfortable lounge after our check out time and prior to our departure on the eurostar the following evening  a very nice stylish hotel conveniently situated we would definitely stay again if we came back to pariswe stayed here a few years back  returnded as it left such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the

quiet which is a miracle considering its right in the centre of the city you practically fall out of gare du nord and into the hotel it has a big atrium where you can have breakfast the breakfast itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water pressure i got in the shower its the perfect place for a trip to pariseverything in this hotel is superb value for money cleanliness  the staff could not be more helpful  everybody was excellent but a special thank you to garmial at

made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord near the first day lunch placebrasserie flodere and easy to get elsewhere just lovely helpful staff which makes all the difference  nothing too much trouble and super friendly also great

            "stayed for 4 nights at lumieres monmartre and had a pleasant enjoyable experience staff are helpful and polite and speak english well  the rooms are modern very clean and cozy and there is minimal noise from the street outside the nearest metro station is around 10 mins walking and links to anywhere in the city  there is no installed air conditioning but rooms have fans that are quiet and keep you cool on warm days  would not hesitate to book here againnice clean modern rooms small but to be expected in pairs shop across the road cute restaurant s and bakery nearby  not too far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus

sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed

day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back\n",

extremely satisfactory great location in the city with ease of access to all amenities coming from the uk we find it hard to communicate in french but the bartender barry gave us many suggestions on the local area and made our stay at the bar a great night hats off to him for great servicei usually like hostels as they are more affordable and social compared to hotels a tradeoff in comfort is part of the deal  unfortunately this hostel was not for me the signiture barnightclub of st christophers inn is located at the hart of the hostel giving al rooms with a courtyard view entertainmant throuought the night good if you like to party the night away but not if you just want a decent nights sleep  additionally i was grossed out by my pillows even though they had clean cassings the verry sharp sweat odor was unbearable   not my best hostel experiencewonderful hostel everythings clean and the people are so nice even in a 10 bed room very good to stay there  especially the barkeeper barry made us feel welcome and made sure everyone was socializing well  also the train station is 2 minutes away which was very good when ill go to paris next time i know where im gonna stayi have only had the pleasure of spending one night at the st christophers inn but i have had so much fun and made so many friends  if you are looking for parisian nightlife this is the place to go   we were given a free workshop on making mojitos by barry it was so awesome  i would recommend this hostel to any students traveling on a budget looking to have some funwe really enjoyed our recent stay at st christophers inn the hostel was perfect for our needs and located close to the train station one of the highlights of our stay in paris was an evening spent in the adjoining bar where our fellow irishman  barry made sure the drink was flowing and everyone was in good form i would definitely recommend this hostel and bar  ive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems to take it as an argument for the bathrooms to be uncleaned showers and toilets were not clean corridors have no end and you have to pass multiple doors from the elevator to finally get to your room i felt like i was sleeping in a warehouse there was no air con and some people had problems with their windows that would not open good to mention that gare du nord is a crappy neighborhoodsuch a good vibe at the hostel a perfect place to meet new people and socialise  easy when bartender barry is on the job making sure everyone is having fun and never an empty glass i can only recommend this place to all travelling by yourself or with a friendamazing staff and customer service the trip was amazing the customer service was amazing you are greeted at reception by lovely staff and the atmosphere as amazing  5 star would defo about visit againparry the irish was great he taught us how to make mojitos and made us feel very welcome here we met lots of people from around the world and there was just a really great vibe inside the bar with all the other travelers we hope to go to stchristophers inn in other countrieswhen we made a reservation and went to the hotel they said that it was impossible for us to pay cash and that was the procedure  another customer who was there asked to pay to help us and we were going to give him cash  but the woman at the reception said very harshly that such a thing was not possible it was our last day in paris or even in france  we were in a panic and they were never helpful  they were very rude  they took cash payment for the two people who came after us but they told us it was impossible the rudest owner people i have ever seen i am so unhappy that they made our last night so bad  i will never step foot in here againive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems
