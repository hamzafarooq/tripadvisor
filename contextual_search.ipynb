very clean and nicely oversized with a jaccuzi   would stay againwhat a fantastic locale the rooms were clean perhaps recently remodeled but what makes the difference is the staff everyone was smiling said a sincere good morning and was attentive the food was great they have an evening reception and snacks and breakfast is included in your stay we will definitely be backi and my wife stayed here as a base whilst visiting yosemite national park for three  days the inn is located in a decent location outside of oakhurst which has all the necessities one could need   the check in experience was great and the chap who served was polite and nice they offered some nibbles waiting in our room which was a nice touch after a long drive from san fran   our room was clean and tidy though was a little smaller than i had hoped the jetted tub was a bit tired but worked fine and was a great shout after a long hike breakfast was nice but we only tried once given we were up super early each day they had offered to get up earlier to accommodate but i didnt think it was fair for them to do so  you get a feel for what a hotel is really like withrefer to photos of the filthy tile outside room filthy bathroom tiny tv way across the room  shelf blocking ac circulation light switch you cant turn off because of poor planning sun shining under the door gaudy tub filthy jets left after 1 night overpriced just to add to the horrorfrom the moment we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with such great customer service and hospitality through the workers and welcome cards the hotel is also in a location that is convent to visit yosemite everything the hotel provided was excellent in our small homewe stayed the summer cottage house like how convent and tasty breakfast was to the spacious areas of both the house and driveway which made parking simple the room also had a warm and homey feel to it with everything neatly placed and a fireplace even the breakfast that was provided was fresh and could even be delivered to you snacks and drinks were also accommodated for us as well during the evening reception which really sealed this hotel as a wonderful visit most important though was definitely thethe room and amenity were very nice i like their welcome snack bar wine fruits and pickles the breakfast was great there were options you could choose from the hotel was very clean and lovely we enjoyed our stay there very muchhounds tooth inn is just near the south gate of yosemite   it offers homestay atmosphere but the area has bad cellphone reception  slow wifi   room was clean  bathroom is small and noisy of fan sound  no elevator so it was hard to carry luggage through narrow stairsloved the rooms so quaint and very elegant we liked the food and the breakfast was amazing  chef was personable and accommodating  we would love to come again next time we will get the cabin looks so amazing thank the staff and chef for his amazing foodwonderful small hotel stayed for 3 nights and we were impressed by the high quality service excellent breakfast and loved the complimentary wine and snacks every evening room was fairly small but had everything you need including hot tub about an hour and 20 drive from yosemite valley but preferred staying in this area as close to a number of restaurants and more going on during the evenings highly recommend this placegreat service hospitality excellent breakfast consistent everyday our room was not cleaned everyday due to the pandemic but the staff was available if we needed anything if you are looking for a quiet place to relax after a busy day in the area they have wine and cheese  in the eveningsthe summer cottage was delightful we are locals but want a night alone for our anniversary room was very good sized however the bed  bedding was very uncomfortable the sheets  blankets were very stiff  itchy the bed was very hard i like a firm mattress and made a clanging sound every time you moved  the staff was amazing  very friendly  breakfast was delicious  cooked exactly like we asked  we missed the evening thing but it was offered to us anyways  check inout was very simple  the jacuzzi tub was fantastic as was the double showers heads in the bathroom  it was very clean  well maintained  besides the bed needing to be replaced the only thing i would suggest is an outside seating area to enjoy the beautiful areamy wife and i stayed four nights at the hounds tooth inn and were very happy with our stay  the staffs customer service was excellent the room was clean and comfortable and the location is very convenient for trips into yosemite  breakfast was great each day  we would be very happy to stay there againalthough we missed the sign coming from town at first turning into the inn was a pleasant end to the day  our room was at the end of the upstairs hall overlooking the valley behind it although there was another private property which could be seen  having a nice welcome note and a small tray of fruit in the fridge was thoughtful the fireplace would be nice in a cooler time of year but i did enjoy soaking in the jacuzzi after a long day hiking our bed was very comfortable too  we were back in time each evening for the wine and meatcheese board so we didnt even need to go out to eat  we really liked the preorder for breakfast choices  which was cooked to order by the private chef  no prepackaged food here  in fact we asked if there could be a go box made for ourwe greatly enjoyed the spacious room with fireplace and jacuzzi bathtub while sipping our wine from the even reception wonderful experience  adorable decorations throughout the inn and friendly staff the breakfast was delicious and filling as we headed out to yosemitelovely cozy hotel with very friendly service good breakfast and clean rooms location close to the south entrance of yosemite and really calm at night but still close to different restaurants and shops  we had a great stay definitely recommendedmy husband and i stay here for a 3 night trip to yosemite we drove about 40mins to the park every morning insider tip download the gypsy app for an amazing audio tour of the park the breakfast was delicious the bed was super comfortable and clean and we felt very safe there a big plus was the free wine and cheese they offered every evening my husband and i arrived on wednesday and were treated very warmly by shelby we enjoyed the evening receptions tremendously and the breakfasts were awesome and very filling which was very helpful since we knew we would be walking over 6 miles a day in yosemite the room was spacious and comfortable but could really use a table the bathroom is large but there also should be a side table to put your toiletries on the jacuzzi tub was nice and big but unfortunately when we tried to use it the water came out pink derek thought maybe it had something to do with the rain but he had no definite answer for us this was a big disappointment since this was the reason we booked this room we also had no hot water that afternoon and we both had to take cold showers another bummer wewe stayed in room 13 and had a great experience the room is beautiful and the surroundings are quiet and peaceful the breakfasts are amazing thank you chefs  evening wine pairings were quaint and the fire just added to the ambiance employees are polite and friendly cannot wait to return they were really kind welcoming and hosting us in their new like hotel it was a very positive experience that well always remember at the end of our vacation parking was big enough it was calm during the night especially we were satisfied with quality mattressloved the welcome letter and blueberry pie on arrival  breakfast fabulous with a different choice every day  drinks  nibbles in the evening a lovely touch  rooms comfortable  staff welcoming  definitely would recommend and would not hesitate to stay there again  great base for yosemite  room was comfortable cozy and clean hotel offers free wine and cheese every night at 810pm for guests to enjoy by the fire location was perfect for a 40 minute drive to yosemite breakfast was made to order and super tasty town had lots of restaurants and services 2minute drive away coffee and water providedmy husband and i stayed one night in the inn and were very pleased the english estate type home boasts 12 rooms  fresh paint and uncluttered decor made us feel at home arriving we were welcomed into a cozy space with lovely furnishings a cheery fire glass of wine and a helpful manager once in our room we found a complimentary charcuterie plate in our regrigerator that we really enjoyed dont miss the pepper jelly and cheese on bread rounds we woke the next morning to wonderful smells from the kitchen our prearragned breakfasts were served the moment we sat down in the dining room this is no continental breakfast  far more we ate near the fire and enjoyed the surrounding woods and fall colors the one suggestion i would offer would be to upgrade some of thei and my wife stayed here as a base whilst visiting yosemite national park for three  days the inn is located in a decent location outside of oakhurst which has all the necessities one could need   the check in experience was great and the chap who served was polite and nice they offered some nibbles waiting in our room which was a nice touch after a long drive from san fran   our room was clean and tidy though was a little smaller than i had hoped the jetted tub was a bit tired but worked fine and was a great shout after a long hike breakfast was nice but we only tried once given we were up super early each day they had offered to get up earlier to accommodate but i didnt think it was fair for them to do so  you get a feel for what a hotel is really like withlovely cozy hotel with very friendly service good breakfast and clean rooms location close to the south entrance of yosemite and really calm at night but still close to different restaurants and shops  we had a great stay definitely recommendedwhat a fantastic locale the rooms were clean perhaps recently remodeled but what makes the difference is the staff everyone was smiling said a sincere good morning and was attentive the food was great they have an evening reception and snacks and breakfast is included in your stay we will definitely be back room was

yosemite park entrance spacious room with an oversized jacuzzi room was clean and well kept the staff super friendly appreciated that we had to reduce our stay by and day and they accommodated without any penalty   two highlights for us i sitting outside enjoying  a glass of wine and have two deers walk by and ii really good breakfast options to choose from and the chef doing a great job preparing each order  good spread of cheeses cookies and snacks in the afternoon to munch on although the wine could have been a better quality   all in all a great option and would recommend itour family recently stayed at this inn as our base for hiking at yosemite the location was perfect the staff were attentive and helpful throughout our stay however the chef deserves particular praise for his personal effort on the breakfast menu these meals were simply delicious he would also provide samples of new dishes as he was creating them for the staff they were all very sweet and knowledgable about the local hikes i was forewarned the halfdome would take 13 hours and it did  we hope our travels bring us back to this very special place  we wouldnt stay anywhere else thank you for an all

definitely recommend this beautiful hotelauthentic very friendly crew clean and quiet slept great  vintage furniture and comfortable bed inside and outside staircases generous parking great beer and wine choicesreasonably priced great choice and wonderful way to enter yosemite  left my kindle there and they agreed to send it to me took a short trip to yosemite this hotel was a perfect location  lots of food options around and it was clean with comfortable bedding  didnt get to see the live music but it seems like it has a really nice ambience outside as well would recommend it for sureclassic california gold rush era hotel  small rooms at least the one we were in but not unexpected for a historic structure  great tap room with full bar and several beers on tap  decent bar food  appetizers are quite good  small indoor dining area and large outdoor beer garden with live music  fooddrink service staff very friendly and helpful  understand there is a general store on premises but did not go there  this was our 3rd or 4th stay at the groveland hotel over the last 10 years  new ownership has big plans i think for improvements and upgrades  a great upgrade would be some sort of breakfast offering as i suspect a lot of guests are looking to get up and out to yosemitehistoric hotel with creaky wood floors thick carpets inroom sinks and apparently a resident ghost  but with a chic little wine and beer bar and a gorgeous patio where they play live music  i felt like i was staying in a movie set  the rooms have the traditional layout so do not expect the cavernous expanse of the marriot but it is fun and refreshing to stay in a hotel that has retained the original details  great couples hotel just 30 minutes from yosemitebooked a one night stay here at the last minute what a wonderful hotel groveland is about 30 miles outside of yosemites big oak flat entrance so a pretty easy drive into or out of the park our room was extremely comfortable great bed and nice antique furnishings all the reception desk people were incredibly nice and helpful the back patioeating area is lovely and comfortable there are also a number of nice outdoor areas on the 1st and 2nd levels to sit and enjoy the evening or morning couple of things to note 1 groveland is a very small town with limited dining options 2 the hotel is right on 120 so there is traffic noise if youre in one of the front rooms 3 there are no elevators so if stairs are an issue for you request a ground floor room 4 the acthe staff stephanie caitlyn sam owner derek marissa janice excuse the name spellings were so welcoming gracious and made you feel like honored guests  i had a wonderful birthday celebration there  the rooms were very clean  the bar was very fun  live music in the wonderful outdoor garden area both nights we were there enjoying drafts of pliney the elder   coffee in the morning on the front porch was delightful   quaint town and easily walkable  we so enjoyed being outside after returning from yosemite  we highly recommend the groveland hotel and will look forward to a return visitloved our stay in this charming historic hotel about as close as you can get to yosemite national park without breaking the bank still an hour drive into yosemite valley but worth it for the great food and coffee spots in groveland plus live music and beautiful outdoor courtyard at the hotel a great place to come home to each night after adventures in ynp welcoming staff charming environment great experience here beware of late check in call ahead if youre going to arrive late in the evening welcome drinks offered at the bar nice touch limited menu but well done homecooked options chef doubled as a bartender was cool to chat up queen room price fir good value but pretty small  wifi slow but acceptable hot water scalding about an hour to yosemite get a great coffee down the street from mountain sagethe groveland hotel is quaint with friendly and gracious staff   our room was very clean and quiet we choose this hotel for its proximity to yosemite national park the iron door saloon in it previous life was a pony express station which today hasvery good foodi was on a day trip to yosemite and in the last minute thought of staying in groveland i had not heard about grovelandd hotel before but i  booked this since it had good reviews here my expectations were low since even basic hotels around yosemite are quite expensive boy was i impressed when i checked in after a full day of exploring yosemite i had no idea that the hotel had a 160 year history and was a historic building even though the building was more than 100 years old it is still surprisingly well maintained and clean the room although small was very comfortable and clean the day i was staying here it was around quite warm at 91 degrees outside and the air conditioning in the room was just perfect this place was way over my expectations the staff is onehistoric building with refurbished rooms very clean and staff were very helpful and accomodating the rooms are airconditioned and there  are restaurants in walking distance    we stayed 2 nights for our visit to yosemite  i would recommend this hotellovely small hotel with amazing staff  shelly at the front desk was so personable   the room was clean and the bed was super comfortable  note that the rooms in the back hear the patio music until 9pm  and they could add a better mirror in the room i was in 4 but a great experience overallreally fun place nice rooms live music in beautiful garden delicious food and beverage shelley took very good care of us would go back try the cheese board for a serious treat i could have used a full length mirror but thats a small thingi stayed 2 nights in the quaint little town of groveland while visiting yosemite the groveland hotel was top notch  the room was very nice with cool decor and a super comfortable bed the staff were very friendly and accommodating the food and drinks were excellent at the outdoor restaurant and tap room beautiful setting will definitely come backmy daughter got married at glacier point in yosemite national park in june  we had our small wedding due to covid   booked at the historic groveland hotel and had our rehearsal dinner and wedding reception there too  proprietors jenn and doug edwards were very accommodating and handled all our needs  the rooms were cozy and very clean and comfortable with the perfect historical ambience  the food was delicious and everyone enjoyed the back patio setting  we highly recommend this placemy son and i stayed at the groveland hotel before our white water rafting trip at cherry creek the location was great the evening entertainment fun and the staff warm and friendly a great experience overalli loved my room 1 at groveland hotel was on way to yosemite for backpacking bed was perfect room perfect and cozy front desk and all employees were lovely ate at the mexican restaurant which was delicious 5 starsbuilding and grounds were absolutely beautiful  staff was always available and extremely helpful  great drinks on tap or by the canbottle  its an older building and sound from surrounding bedrooms was sometimes an issue so i would recommend bringing ear plugs just in casewe truly loved our stay and wish we could have stayed longer our room was nice  cool there is a fabulous patio the staff is friendly  helpful and the food was excellentall in a cute town close to yosemite we certainly hope to see yall againi felt like coming home staying at the groveland hotel  i came out to explore yosemite with my dog kona  we felt so welcome at the hotel and really enjoyed ending the day with the local music in the courtyard dutch carson was awesome  the food was also incredible  im a foodie and the salad had the freshest tomatoes and lettuce felt like it must have been grown and picked right outside  also the cheese and meat charcuterie board both kona and i enjoyed   mild yet flavorful cheese carefully picked out  perfect combination of flavors  the local community is just a nice place to stroll around dont miss the nursery nearby the garden there is so welcoming and

            "the hotel transported you to another time so beautiful and clean we enjoyed having dinner at the jackalopes restaurant and anthonys service and kindness was exceptional we will come back for surei get it  youre close to the wawona entrance and mariposa grove of sequoias  probably all the other accommodations in the area are also expensive  just be aware that you get nothing special at tenaya lodge  our cottage unit was one of 3 in a single building and pretty cramped  the lodge pool is very crowded and noisy with kids the separate adult pool is barely 20 feet away and thus just as noisy  next time ill stay in oakhurst  20 minutes down the hill but much better value    do not eat at the tenaya lodges timberloft pizzeria  frozen pizza served with a scowlfabulous place beautiful and well appointed rooms and friendly staff  we came here for a deluxe vacation following too many that had been cancelled due to the pandemic was really encouraged when we arrived to see that masks were not required of fully vaccinated individuals it was all down hill from there  we had a cabin one of their most expensive bookings but found out that nothing is working or available  only 1 of 3 restaurants open  no room service explorer club house shuttered we get better service at 150night motels than what they have here at 500night  they were very apologetic and understanding but the bottom line is that this was the worst vacation we have ever experience in decades of traveling the world especially considering what it costwe stayed at an explorer cabin and were pleasantly surprised being rerouted due to the fires in sequoia we didnt know what to expect but this was recommended and we booked with no idea what we were getting it is a bit pricey but so spotlessly clean and comfortable they provided walking sticks for hiking flashlights for the pathways leading to the cabins and it is only minutes from the south entrance to yosemite there are front porches on each cabin and community fire pits throughout the cabin areas lit each night for all to enjoy it was very quiet when we were there the lodge area was a bit more bustling but the only place for food it was open till 10 and thinned out later in the evening the food is actually so delicious and the servers fantastic one last perk  we5 plus the combination of your historical knowledge along with taking us to all of the perfect spots helped us really appreciate the beauty of yosemite it was incredible   what are you doing tomorrow  we should hike clouds rest togetherthis hotel is totally overpriced sorrounding are great and the rooms lack maintenance but the sevices are extremely poor when you arrive there is no one to receive you or guide you to the front desk forget about help with your luggage the restaurant is overcrowded and the food has no relation with what they charge you the same situation at the pool bar where there is even a rude bartender who treats people like dogs no one would tell you what the ammenities of the hotel are or what activities you can do theres no hospitality at all you are by yourself the price for that disappointing experience is at least  450 a nightwe had stayed at the tenaya lodge in their explorer cabins a few months ago which were spartan from the outside think army barracks but very nice on the interior with updated furnishings and amenities we returned to yosemite last week and since it was for only one night decided to stay in the main hotel what a mistake our deluxe room did not have working ac the fans kept going on but the room never went below 82 degrees finally i opened the window and then it got very cold so i spent the night opening and closing the window as the temperature alternated between very hot and very cold but wait theres more the mattresses were probably at least 10 years past their throwaway date as they sank and squeaked loudly with the slightest movement it was so ridiculous thatthe lodge is located in a valley surrounded by pines it has a modern lodge design mostly in stone with beautiful furnishings the public areas were more exceptional than the rooms but it was very comfortable we were close to the mariposa grove for our first morning hike in yosemite i loved the outdoor seating areas to read before dinneri would really like to say that despite how this review will sound we are not fussy guests or inpatient but our patience was tested to its limit at our recent stay  this place could be great  unfortunately they do not have enough staff to run the place properly and to make it worse a huge proportion of the staff they do have are not trained properly this includes some of the managers i understand that covid is making finding staff hard for industries so when this is the case the hotel should be charging much less and operating at a lower capacity to allow for staff shortagesthey simply cannot justify the prices they charge for what is provided or not provided  the hotel was totally full when we were there  where they got it right the breakfast team at theindoor pool cool but dirty tiles looked like hadnt been cleaned in weeks          had trouble getting into room finally after 45 and 3 employees was able too they had me exchange cards 3x times before got assistance to the door       food in restaurant only fair had been there before in winter no change in opinion this time meat undercooked had to send back came back dry cooked well no sauce          they sold me defective lanyard in giftshop called several times no reply yet took message      pizza place closed again wanted to trybeautiful lodge about 3 miles from south entrance to yosemite fun pool area lots of yellow jackets around outdoor dining area though for some reason pizza restaurant now open not great onsite deli with premade salads and sandwiches which came in handy only one other restaurant which was a bit high end for us this area is rather isolated compared to oakhurst but closer to yosemite still over an hour to yosemite village but we were prepared for that we stayed in king deluxe suite very spacious my son also enjoyed the 6 pm movies shown at indoor pool each nightwe thought tenaya lodge was great beautiful lodge with nice accommodations nice big fireplace in main lobby they had piano player one evening nice dining experience hot tub and pool it was about a 4050 minute drive to yosemite valley windy roads all the way there would come back againa beautiful resort with wonderful staff and a great location  we had a great time and would highly recommend we stayed 3 nights and could have stayed more  a long drive into yosemite national park valley but well worth it  the staff were very attentive and friendly  loved the christmas decorations and fireplaces and general warm and friendly resortmade a last minute reservation for one night at this lodge before going into yosemite i read some poor reviews but they were so wrong the lodge hotel is first class you know you are a wonderful resort with everything you would expect for an outdoors trip lobby is massive and hallways wide and bright the rooms and the bathroom are hugh walk in shower with plenty of hot water big comfortable king bed wide screen tv we ate supper in the bar area so we could see the football game they had lots of wait staff and service was attentive best chickens wings anywhere in the morning we grabbed everything we needed for a quick breakfast on the road in the convenience store located in the lobby all of it was so fresh and tasty great coffee and latte would love to come heretenaya lodge markets itself as a family and pet friendly hotelit perhaps is but dont go there in the offseason we recently spent 4 days  3 nights at tenaya during the kids autumn break we booked their fido friendly package which was supposed to come with a dogfriendly room amenities for the dog like bed bowls treats toy etc  the booking was at one of their explorer cabins granted the cabins are relatively new with modern decor good heating etc however the cabin village is pretty far removed from tenaya lodge itself the club house was shuttered and while i understand that during covid the housekeeping is optional  there are absolutely no amenities in the cabins outside of 4 keurig pods and 2 paper cups we had to ask multiple times for additional itemsthe lodge buildings are in a beautiful setting would be wonderful except for the price and very poor service we paid over 450 a night for a run of the mill motel room the food in the one opened restaurant was mediocre and extremely overpriced a glass of house red wine was 12 the food was of poor quality frozen and reheated we were told there was a pizzaria on the premises we walked to it to find a shuttered building that hadnt been open in years save your money stay elsewhere anywhere but herefor a place that claims to be a high end resort we had very high expectations  it is a beautiful place but we could not tell that when we got to room 203  we had a view of nothing but a roof and two satellite dishes  taken alone our list of issues was not bad  however when put together they result in a we wont be back one night stay  aside from the view we encountered bartenders who treated customers to gripe sessions about their lack of help the restaurant host who had no idea what the word corkage meant room doors that slammed loudly up and down the hall thin walls and ceilings that treated us to snoring and footsteps at all hours confusing signage ok now i was looking for things  too bad i kept finding them out of service tv in the fitness centerwe lucked out when i booked a two queen bed cottagewe both loved it separated from the main hotel it was quiet and comfortable and altogether lovely when thinking of the days we spent being active in yosemite however the rest of the hotel was very mehfirst off the picture here on tripadvisor is such a glamor shot its a little ridiculous when you actually see it the pool was packed with children from 99 so obviously not fun the dinner is decent but of course overpricedand they have a serious bee problem on the patio which makes dining outside unreasonable and really more could be done about the beesvery unclear why management wasnt taking additional steps for comfort on the patio especially in light of covidbeing safer eating outsidewe spent 3 wonderful nights at the tenaya lodge  check in staff was very nice and very welcoming  our room was very clean well stocked with everything that we could ever need we ate three meals at the jackalope grill i would recommend eating off the menu for breakfast  i had the el capitan omelet it was very good i also had the country style eggs benedict  this was very good also  my wife had the scrambled eggs carnitas tacos steel  cut oatmeal and the avocado ciabatta toast  all were very good  we only ate breakfast at the hotel we spent one day going to yosemite valley and seeing all the sights  it is not a very long drive at all to the valley  my favorite way to go into yosemite valley is coming in the south entrance  the view you get when you come out of thewe had the pleasure of staying in a cabin at tenaya lodge  absolutely loved it   the cabin was clean and cozy the fireplace really made it feel like home the view from our balcony was beautiful the cabin is great for those who want to be a little removed from everything as it is a bit of a walk or a short drive to the the main hotel where the amenities are located there are multiple fire pits in between the cabins so youll find one close no matter which cabin youre in   we loved the food at the on site restaurant jackalopes at the main hotel the vegetable pot stickers were a favorite the pool was pristine and the underwater music was an unexpected joy archery  rock wall activities are available but require a reservationappointment   the staff was helpfulthe hotel grounds were nice but the explorer cabins were ok the website makes them look like authentic log cabins but in reality they look like prefabricated fake log cabins that come in a kit the interior is comfortable especially the living space there is a kitchen but no appliances other than a fridge if you do get an explorer cabin ask for one that has a balcony overlooking the forest we stayed in one that faces the fire pit and a bunch of other cabins since it was pretty much empty that was fine however i cant imagine what that would be like in the summer  the restaurant is very good the staff were all extremely kind and helpfulwe thought tenaya lodge was great beautiful lodge with nice accommodations nice big fireplace in main lobby they had piano player one evening nice dining experience hot tub and pool it was

lodge for 2 days and will never be back  almost every staff member i interacted with was rude and management seemed to not care  everything from the front desk to the gift store to the restaurant was awful but the restaurant was by far the worst i stopped by the bar for a drink and the bartender antony pretended i wasnt there and continued to flirt with the 2 girls sitting having lunch  i asked him for a beer and he told me its rude to interrupt and he will be with me once he is done i waited because there were no other options and then i hear him tell the girls some people are just born stupid ill be right back he then came to me and said what do you want it better be quick because im busy helping other guests that were herewe stayed here for 2 nights with our toddler i originally booked the upstairs cottage room but was convinced to upgrade to the explorer cabin   granted it was rainy and as they dont have bell porters we would have struggled moving our bags and baby gear ourselves   the explorer cabin itself was fine but definitely requires the use of a car between the main lodge and cabins with our toddler   the reason for my low score is that upon entering there was someones used starbucks coffee cup sitting on the bench at first i thought maybe they used starbucks branded pods but i took a look inside and saw leftover coffee   secondly after putting our child to sleep i went to put on a robe only to put my left hand into the pocket with a used tissue so gross needless to say wethis is our second time reserving the cottages at tenaya lodge as described the cottages are walking distance away from the lodge and they give you an outdoorsy cabin feel with hotel amenities    the staff is friendly and accommodating  they offer a wonderful all day tour of yosemite valley   the chicken rigatoni at jackalopes bar and grill was really good  and their deli  has a really wide selection of snacks and drinks    we will always stay at tenaya lodge when visiting yosemite valleyaverage hotel had higher expectations granted this was added last minute as a result of sequoia np being closed close to park yes but still a good 45 minute drive into yosemite np for most valley activities staff all very friendly but clearly understaffed expected due to covid  devastating effect on the hospitality industry upgraded to larger king room with no view in east wing and spent next 3 nights getting lost trying to figure out how to get from room to lobby or room to perking lot signage could be enhanced it required us to walk to end of wing take elevator down to 2nd floor then through the indoor pool area ah the smell of chlorine then through a hallway of photos then either down a flight of stairs or the elevator and parking was on floor 2 notthe hotel

improvements you can stay in a wagon a shed or a cabin this is not a fancy location but a great place if you are visiting mono lake june lake loop or alabama hills  we went there for a meteor shower and took great photos  gas grills gas fire pits a creek near by that will surely put you to sleep and their own restaurant simple but good place to eatwe were unable to stay due to the california fires the day i had booked the 2 tents the air quality was in the red very bad and only that day was the air that bad virginia creek settlement was not willing to cancel my booking due to the dangerous  air quality virginia creek settlement stated  we should of canceled 48 hours  before our reservation the air quality was not predicted to be in the red until the day before our stay my husband had a lung transplant and i have asthma i was really looking forward to staying there but after the uncaring response to our health concerns i wont be booking here againwe stayed one night in cabin 8 it was really great very private nice deck for wine at night or coffee in the morning about 3 steps to the lovely gurgling creek and mountain scenery there was also a gas firepit and chairs yes you can hear the highway but the creek almost drowns it out indoors felt quite spacious the wife appreciated the separate room with bunk beds to escape the snoring husband good size fridge lots of cookware and dishes the water is very quickly nice and hot unfortunately we left one day early due to hazardous air from the fires they told us if they could rent out our room that night they would credit us back and they did we thought that was honorable we would have liked to try the restaurant for breakfast or dinner maybe next time allspent a night here in may 2021 on the way out of reno

sierras the owners are great and are always active available and working on the property the restaurant server was great  lelynn  remembering us and our preferences over multiple days stay on checkin we were given a map and information sheet about the property that included the officerestaurant number and the owners cell phone number they live onsite  in case we needed anything after hours regular

some very nice outdoor furniture all the windows had blackout curtains so we slept perfectly  the whole place felt very clean even had sanitizer and keyless doorsspent a night here in may 2021 on the

creek that is within the property was perfect for the kids to play and family to hangout fire pit with gas connection is very nice trees around the cabin provided good shade on a hot afternoon   restaurant food is very good and staff provide excellent servicewe stayed here 1 night in middecember stayed in a cabin easily 50 less than any other hotel nearby queen bed in living area bunk beds in their own room cable small fridge microwave and full bath fire ring and grill and chairs on the covered porch we got in kinda late after dark so we couldnt look around the interior of the cabin held our family of 4 plus our dog easy check in in the morning we poked around and although its next to a major highway was relatively quiet other cabins were cute too would definitely recommendwe stayed in the motel building john wayne roomhe apparently stayed there while filming north to alaska nice queen bed ac refrig bathshower front and back decks with access to several picnic tables gas fire pitsgreat staff they also have camp style tent cabins with communal bathroom all have fire pits and many have gas bbqs restaurant was excellent we had a small take out pizza and steak and gorgonzola salad to enjoy at a creek side picnic table with our dog and our own wine very generous with toppings and awesome crust the salad was huge fresh and steak was medium as requested and excellent quality will be backdue to a misunderstanding weve had to take a more expensive cabin than booked sure mistakes occur but for that amount of money we have expected more comfort the kitchen was occupied by ants the view out of the window wasnt really nice and the futon was the worst bed of the whole trip torture we couldnt hardly move the next day the idea of the oldsettlementtheme is really good but there should be more love for details and less spiderwebs inside the expensive cabinkinda corny western theme but quite comfortable great location closer to mono lake than rest of town restaurants on site but we didnt try gas in area was most ive ever paid limited entertainment optionsi reviewed this place on yelp when we first stayed here almost a year ago i wasnt a huge fan but our 12 year old still talks about this place   it was completely worth the  and i wish we would have had more time   ps there are ghosts herewe love traveling on 395 one of the nicest roads in the west each time we go we find at least one new great thing this trip it was virginia creek settlement  the staff was friendly the establishment was well built well maintained and very well run  we stayed in one of the motel rooms but walked around to check out the other charming accommodations  everything was so tidy yet welcoming at the same time  we also ate at the restaurant where the service was impeccable but the food was just ok you know that saying you cant have it allthis place was amazing such a cute little tucked away wooden cottage by a creek clean good value good food wifi cable anything you want it has it i didnt want to leave  we stayed here on our way to yosemite national park its a little far away for doing day trips into the park but perfect for our day trip to mammoth mountainwe stayed in a lovely cabin by the creek   number 11 which i can highly recommend however what stood out was how well we were looked after by the young men on duty when we were there we had problems with our car rental but they allowed us to use the phone to sort out the problem and gave lots of advice to help sort things thanks guysa very quirky rustic hotel room was nice in a quirky rustic basic cosy way all wooden lodge which was probably the upper end of the rooms available there was some sort of cabin toiletshower block accommodation available even a covered waggon with a double bed only inside a bit pricey for what was on offer but no complaints intended to eat breakfast and dinner here but was disappointed to see how more it would cost compared to what was on offer in bridgeportwhen looking for a place to stay before going to yosemite we found the covered wagons at virginia creek settlement the description sounded great even the fact that it was basic accommodation with shared facilities was not an issue and also the location next to the river appealed to us so we made a booking what we didnt realize is the altitude where bridgeport lies and that in september it can easily be below zero during the night so on arriving at the site we were a bit nervous what to expect but during checkin that nervousness was taken away why the wagons are equipped with electric blankets so we didnt have to worry about the cold temperatures during the night it made the stay even better  furthermore the wagons are indeed next to the river and with havingif you want a place to unwind this is it in the mountains near yosemite the cabins are adorable and cozy they have chairs and outdoor gas fire rings on the edge of a babbling brook  they have a wonderful restaurant on site as well  great tv hookup as well loved itits a nice location and has plenty of choice from basic wagons to luxurious rooms and cottages we had the second most basic options but unfortunately because of a heater that did not work it was still bitterly cold at night basically there is no isolation whatsoever people where not friendly not unfriendly either but just felt they did not care breakfast pancakes where drie as dirt and came with little syrup could be much betterwe stayed a night there because we would snowboard nearby in the following day it is a small but cozy and clean place it reminds a little of the old western places really nice i would come back many timesrecently visited for 4 days and nights in early november  have to rate this an excellent experience  we stayed in one of the stream side cabins which was clean comfortable and stocked daily with fresh supplies  and it was warm considering night temps were 19 degrees at night  the manufactured cabins were roomy and well organized for their actual size and frankly rather beautiful with knotty pine interiors and appropriate interior decoration  the staff left us mostly to ourselves as we went there for peace and quiet but when we did need them were not only available but helpful and sincerely nice people  it is attached to a rather high quality restaurant that is along 395 that serves as the office in the day and evening   the review that popped up on my computer wasall the reviews etc sounded very positive about this place so we booked it as halfway between mammoth lakes  lake tahoe  the restaurant sounded decent as well as convenient  we were 2 road weary seniors with 2 small dogs thinking that eschewing our rv for motels would make for an easier trip but found it not so  other stops along the way proved to be not as nice as we thought but we were really hopeful that this place would be different  at first this seemed to be true the place was very clean restaurant adjacent to the motel  cabins etc  the room itself was quite spacious clean  decorated in the log cabin style suited for this beautiful part of the country  however after spending an exorbitant amount on dinner at the restaurant we returned to our room (Score: 0.5128)\n",

            "just our opinion this place is average at best we have been in ca for over ten days and it is the first time our backs have hurt after a nights sleep pillows are awful shower drain is clogged makes you wonder if they clean the tub because it back up right away so someone should of noticed check in was easy but women at front seemed like she couldnt be bothered didnt mention anything about the hotel at all no welcoming smile or info of any kind room size was good no elevator to second floor so keep that in mind if you need one no black out curtains for this who may like to sleep in or keep the hotel lights out of your roomthis place so exactly suited our needs clean uptodate furnishings quality linens great shower courteous staff that we wish there were a chain of these in the other areas of socal that well be visiting we visited in december 2021clean modern rooms with all you could need the staff was friendly and helpful fixed a slow draining sink immediately fridge good size and the exterior area was awesome for socializing with a playground and a pool near picnic tables we cooked our meal and sat outside while the kids played  and a 20 minute drive into yosemite would happily recommend yosemite westgate lodgewe had a f unexpected amily emergency   2 days into our stay the hotel staff especially the manager was so kind to us thank you this is a beautiful property and well maintained really close to the entry gatewe were really surprised by how modern the rooms were considering they dont look like much on the outside our room was clean modernized and equipped with microwavefridgecoffee maker there was a nice pool area with bocce ball and tables to sit at outside to watch the sun set it was about an hour drive from the yosemite valley visitor center which was not bad given the lack of affordable lodging options in the area would stay here againthe hotel was clean with big rooms they have a nice pool and a good but busy restaurant next door the front desk was helpful when i wanted to extend my stay and i would stay in this area again if headed into the parkremodeled motel clean  warmish pool  hot tub not ready for the summer  desk staff not vey friendly nor accessible  but 1012 miles from the park entrance  next door restaurant handy nothing fancy but edible foodgreat place to stay was very impressed modern comfortable beautiful nook in the middle of nowhere nice playground for kids room was comfy and one of the nicest along our 10 day stay throughout california the lucky buck next door has a good breakfast and waitress was oh so friendly did not get to see yosemite because our tour was cancelled and we didnt have a reservation but this little place made it worth it highly recommenddidnt k ow what to expect and was pleasantly surprised  the lodge was great  the room was very clean  the beds were so comfortable  we ate at the cafe that was next door and the food was amazing  it is short scenic drive to the west gate of yosemite  would definitely stay there again  the staff was very friendly and helpfulwe had reservations and they did not honor it and gave our rooms away my wife and i had booked 2 rooms for our 8 person family and were going to spend 1800 for 3 days near the yosemite np entrance when i showed up on the day we were supposed to check in they acted as if they could not find my reservation then it turned out they cancelled it because they could not run the charge on our credit card we had put a card on file 2 months ago but due to fraudulent activity chase sent us a new one these guys waited until the day we were going to show up to charge us and when it came back declined they emailed and called but we were in the park without any reception at 8 pm we had no rooms my recommendation is that you insist on having them charge you or stop by the day ofthe hotel staff were friendly rooms were clean and stocked with coffee machine microwave and fridge beds and sheets comfy pool and hot tub were amazing after driving all day restaurant next door made the morning even easier would stay againas others have stated we werent sure what to expect    what we found wasnice big room for 5 very close to yosemite entrance  recently redecorated very clean and roomy  nice out door sitting areas pool and playground within the lodge property which is park like in that there are many trees views etc  lodge store and vending machines for your convenience and a great restaurant next door  we would stay here againthis was a last minute hotel selection and it exceeded our expectations the rooms are fresh and modern inside very clean the grounds were nice and it is about as close as you can get to the park entrance we would stay here again when in the areaa\twhile not in yosemite np itself and doesnt count for the reservation system that yosemite is currently doing we really enjoyed this lodging parking was convenient the room was spacious and the grounds were quite fun there is a pool playground cornhole play area and a nice little sitting area for people to hang out outside of their rooms my family had a lot of fun hanging out in this area after dinner there is also a little laundromat in the area which was very helpful though there was only 23 machines that ran on quarters there is also a convenient restaurant right next door that is pretty good very really isnt much else in the area to see or do until you go to yosemite np of course would definitely recommend this lodging establishmenti was a little apprehensive about what i might find at a nonchain motel but i was very pleased with our entire experience from checkin to checkout we stayed 2 days while visiting yosemite we enjoyed the poolhot tub and the restaurant next door i would absolutely stay here again and i tend to be a bit of a hotel snob hahawe thoroughly enjoyed our stay the renovations are very modern and clean  and the staff friendly and accommodating since we were there to explore yosemite  we didnt really utilize the amenities  but the pool and playground were very inviting the neighboring restaurant had great food and excellent service and there were groceries and other restaurants available only a few miles up the road i had a mix up with my initial booking and the owner was very gracious in assisting me to fix my error this is an excellent choice for lodging with easy access to yosemitesomeone really loves this property it is sparkling clean and comfortable the rooms are modern and equipped with a microwave and fridge the pool and hottub were clean and refereshing i loved the lounge chairs kids play set and cornhole game area 1010 would recommend and were well rested each evening for hiking the lucky buck cafe was incredible with fresh and huge portions and is located right next door dont miss out on the homemade apple piethis motel is immaculate comfortable has many outdoor areas to sit or swim the restaurant has great service and good food i will certainly stay there again it is surrounded by beautiful forest and is close to both yosemite and grovelandwe stayed at this place for its close proximity to yosemite its

ports for charging devices definitely came handyroom seems was recently updated modern finishes bed ok not a foam top though  clean quiet all you can hope for restaurant next door very convenient and super friendly staff great service good food big breakfast for a busy day and dinner in the evening  did not use the pool nice modern tv remote doesnt really work since the satellite box is hidden behind tv so have to stand directly under tv for it to work but wasnt that big of a deal we were so tired from our exploring that we just fell asleep early i would recommend this hotel easy access to yosemitewe appreciate the cleanliness of the rooms and comfortable beds  the owners were accommodating even during stressful covid times   the lucky buck restaurant was a nice surprise expected a meat and 3 place but it has a very nice menu with healthy choices and friendly staff  folks should know the nearest grocery store is in groveland if you want snacks or drinks in the room  refrigerator was a nice amenity  the drive to yosemite was not bad and the difference in price for park hotels was significantthis is a very nice lodge the room was spacious and very clean and modernized i woke up in

            "we enjoyed our two night stay at the bwp oakhurst  i was disappointed to learn that they were still providing only grab n go breakfasts but was pleasantly surprised by the quality the next day i did have to drive down and take it back to the room but the quality and glutenfree choices were most appreciated the only thing that they could do better was deliver breakfast to the room  the facilities and ambiance were top rate we will certainly stay again when we return to bass lake or yosemitelocated just outside south entrance older but very nice and clean hotel great service and great restaurant right next door [oakhurst grill] this is also where [included] breakfast is served opted to stay on west side of park following 2 nights in el portal much more expensive  terrible lodge wish we would have stayed here every nightwe enjoyed our two night stay at the bwp oakhurst  i was disappointed to learn that they were still providing only grab n go breakfasts but was pleasantly surprised by the quality the next day i did have to drive down and take it back to the room but the quality and glutenfree choices were most appreciated the only thing that they could do better was deliver breakfast to the room  the facilities and ambiance were top rate we will certainly stay again when we return to bass lake or yosemitethe service and rooms here are always terrific they have good space and even options for bigger families the breakfast is at a restaurant and is so good my kids think it is the best part and you cant beat the drive to yosemiteeverything was clean and enjoyable staff is excellent and so are the rooms the chinese restaurant next store is also very good and tasty so access to clean rooms and chinese food next store made for the perfect staynice dog friendly hotel with grounds  in a wooded setting friendly staff and we received excellent service we ate at the restaurant for dinner which was very good  our trip was to yosemite and the hotel was 30 minutes to the entrance which was an easy drive from the hotelmy boyfriend and i had a wonderful long weekend at this inn outside of the southern gates of yosemite the hotel grounds are as i said enchanting huge squirrels played in the tree tops just outside each rooms balcony while deer grazed below the grounds are covered in unique art pieces statues my favorite was the vintage inspired street lamps lighting the walkways i didnt swim but there are both an indoor and outdoor pooljacuzzi   my room was clean and large we had a mural of yosemite painted on the wall the continental breakfast was great real eggs plus all the sides to make a great breakfast burrito   the staff was friendly and provided top  notch customer service we will definitely be repeat customersjust a short 30 minute drive to yosemite national park booking a tour bus is the best way to beat the parking problems in the park the yosemite gateway inn is in a good location for traveling to yosemite park our room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly for some time there was visible ionized dust on the bathroom vent dust on the curtains covering the sliding door to the balcony there was no bath tub mat making taking a shower a risky challenge the bed was comfortable but had no blanket the pillows were the best part of the room or i was just really tired did not explore the small pool and hot tub that was next to our unit would we stay again  probably not since we only live 3 hours awaybreakfast was delicious rooms were clean and had great views location was perfect for yosemite day trip we were able to sleep well staff was friendly we were greeted when we arrived late the hostess answered questions with patience and knowledgewhen we first got to the front desk the lady who help us didnt seem that friendly she acted a little stiff i dont know but i felt like was it because we were a biracail couple with mixed children and not caucasian i guess they dont see too many blk and asian in town so maybe the lady didnt feel comfortable but after i told her my daughter graduated from this missionary school then she started to relaxed and started being friendlier but besides that every thing was goodthis hotel is in a great location and has so many nice amenities there is a restaurant next door breakfast there is included both an indoor and outdoor pool  hot tub a playground several grassy areas to take your pup for a walk and to do their business including baggies  a trash can and a unique gift shop all of the employees i encountered were super friendly and helpful i would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeatweve been staying here for 30 plus years i am so glad it has maintained its high standards and not given in to updating  the decor is from the 70s lets just enjoy it  rooms are spotless grounds are gorgeous the breakfast is generous and delicious  appreciate all the paintings and murals that were done by the owner years ago  please dont let anyone modernize this place its a treasurethank you very muchronda  rashelldaisydusty and mike thank you for all the efforts to find the missing iphonewe apologize the iphone was mistaken wrapped into the personal towels  great service 5 starsbest western plus in oakhurst is spread out over a parklike property with indoor and outdoor pools and hot tubs the grounds and rooms are well maintained rooms are roomy and seem recently refurbished there is a good restaurant that is popular with locals an ample breakfast is included the service team was friendly and helpful buildings are located on a somewhat steep hill that might prove challenging to the less fit who are lodged up the hill although these are the best rooms with a view in my view those who dont want to climb the hill can drive up and downgreat location and full breakfast included the rooms are seriously dated old grainy tvs smelly and loud air conditioners tiny fridge with a useless freezer since it was covered in condensation the pools are amazing love the indoor pool optionsince my arrival i felt that i made the right choice of hotel the staff is efficient and friendly the room was clean fresh and the view was so calming we got to see in front of our balcony a fawn and her family the breakfast had a choice for each member of my family  the parking was no problem there was always an available parking space  the place is pet friendly     perfectmy family and i stayed for several days for day trips into yosemite valley  the drive in wasnt too bad getting into the valley floor being able to spend as much time as we wanted in the park  the hotel itself was very nice and with very friendly staff  the property landscaping was beautiful  also we really appreciated the dogfriendliness of the accommodations   rooms are not super fancy but met all our needs and then some  clean room comfortable beds and quiet locationmy husband myself and our 2 daughters along with my dad stayed at this property in august 2021 on our visit to yosemite national park  the hotel is older but our room was updated with new mattresses and was very clean    we had a room with 3 queen beds and it was perfect for our family of 5  i wish more hotels had this option    the first morning we had the bagged breakfast but on the second day we were able to eat in the dining room of the  restaurant  they had a large assortment of items from eggs to cereal  all of the staff we encountered were very friendlythe hotel was nicely located near yosemite and we had a great time staying at the hotel due to the covid breakfast was packed in a bag to pick up so you can enjoy in your room internet was fast and i would for sure go back if we travel to yosemite againa good choice for starting or ending your yosemite trip the staff is very welcoming and helpful overlook the outdated decor because this is a great place to stay the pool and hot tub helped revive our hikeweary feet breakfast was lovelyvery relaxing  great value actuall was checked in to another large hotel and after the first night being unsatisfied with our experience we checked in to the best western plus yosemite gateway inn and enjoyed the mountain style inn very muchwe selected this motel due to its proximity to yosemite entrancejust 25 minutes away  multiple twostory buildings are spread out on the complex with both an outdoor pool and an indoor poolthere is also a campfire area  nice lobby    guest rooms are worn and dated  we stayed in a family suite which worked out very nicely with a separate bedroom  carpet was stained and room didnt smell the best as the family suites with balconies and patios are also the pet friendly rooms  i suspect there had been a pet accident  pet free suites can be requested but they are without balcony or patiowe opted to take a chance for a balcony or patio but would not repeat that choice  our patio area was overgrown with vegetation that needed trimming     breakfast was grab andfrom the lobby to the pools to the restaurant to the guest rooms beautiful decor great location about 20 min from yosemite park entrance delicious food menu free hot breakfast indoor and outdoor pools gym and laundry on site comfortable and clean exceeded my expectations loved itour family seven of us  four adults and three children spent four days in sequoia national park and then traveled to yosemite oakhurst  we decide to stay at the best western plus due to experience with best western and we were not disappointed  on recommendation from the front desk we stay in the cottage which can sleep nine  the cottage worked great for us  the beds were comfortable and the rooms clean  the internet was exceptional and the breakfast though somewhat limited was very generous and staff very helpful  though we did not eat at the restaurant on the property we understood from people in the community it is one of the best restaurants in town  there are many options to stay in oakhurst but we highly recommend you consider the best western plusstayed at best western at oakhurst the staff was courteous and breakfast was decent the room had a nice view we saw deers and fox from our patio overall a convenient stayover as we had 2 nights reservation inside the lodge  overall a decent place to stay as its close to the entrancethe service and rooms here are always terrific they have good space and even options for bigger families the breakfast is at a restaurant and is so good my kids think it is the best part and you cant beat the drive to yosemitenice dog friendly hotel with grounds  in a wooded setting friendly staff and we received excellent service we ate at the restaurant for dinner which was very good  our trip was to yosemite and the hotel was 30 minutes to the entrance which was an easy drive from the hotellocated just outside south entrance older but very nice and clean hotel great service and great restaurant right next door [oakhurst grill] this is also where [included] breakfast is served opted to stay on west side of park following 2 nights in el portal much more expensive  terrible lodge wish we would have stayed here every nightthe hotel and grounds are beautiful the staff is friendly and courteous we enjoyed the restaurant breakfast and dinner this was our first time visiting this area and going to yosemite the drive to the park was scenic maybe 3040 minutes oakhurst is a good size city with all of the stores and things that you would need  we would definitely stay here againeverything was clean and enjoyable staff is excellent and so are the rooms the chinese restaurant next store is also very good and tasty so access to clean rooms and chinese food next store made for the perfect stay (Score:

exaggeration   we took 2 12 hours for dinner and just relaxed drank wine and really connected  it was just so nice to be out after locked up for so long from covid and this bb gave us that opportunity

of this wonderful old house on the hill the charles segerstrom suite is large with a massive high grand and super comfortable bed the room has loads of character and history there is a shared balcony overlooking the front drive which usually has a vintage renovated or in the process of renovation pre wwii rolls royce which the other innkeeper fred spends his time doing  rhonda and fred are clearly

everything was very welcoming right down to the delicious homemade cookies in the room  but what we did not expect was breakfast  the breakfast was really the highlight of our entire spring break  the

kidsthank you for an amazing stay at your bed and breakfast in feb we felt welcomed from the moment we stepped in the front historical entrance of your inn by rhonda and fred not only was the food

elaborate breakfasts also friendly cats ducks and a dog coffee and tea are available all day in the library and bowls of candies abound if you need a little sugar shot we had the original guest room on the ground floor perfectly adequate but the rooms on the second floor are larger one comment though there are so many bibelots strewn around in both bedroom and bathroom that we found it hard to put down our books toiletry kits etc that having been said we wouldnt hesitate to recommend the inn nor to returnfor years we have been coming at least once a year to the inn on knowles hill our

2019  we were made to feel right at home in this beautiful place  we had everything we needed and everywhere was spotlessly clean  it was a 10 minute walk down into town where there are plenty of bars  restaurants  however the highlight of this bb was the breakfast which was the best we had during our fortnights breakknowles hill was simply wonderful we were traveling with a less than easy going 5 year old and rhonda made sure that she was happy here we woke up the first morning to the best breakfast ive ever had which was followed the next morning by the best breakfast ive ever had the grounds

ahead and spoke to sherilee who is incredibly hospitable and kind on the phone the moment we walked in the door she greeted us with a huge smile we stayed in the half dome room which was super quaint and cozy i absolutely loved the little touches like little chocolates left on our freshly made bed sherilee even put a birthday candle in my yogurt so my boyfriend could sing happy birthday to me i was impressed by the breakfast sherilee and her mom prepared each day way more fancy than i expected both of them are patient and are the most amazing hosts during breakfast be sure to pick sherilees brain about yosemite she knowswe spent 3 nights with sherilee and had a really nice stay the weather was a bit unkind which meant we didnt make the most of our time  at the lodging mum and daughter set up works very well and we enjoyed talking to them both very comfortable bed  the lodge is about 15 minutes out of oakhurst which means you have to drive into to eat but apart from that it is a great locationthis was our 3rd visit to yosemite and our 2nd stay at this bb the location is a little out of the way but the setting and the hospitality more than make up for it the handmade breakfasts are something else and it is always a lovely surprise to see what sherilee cooks up you wont be disappointedwe stayed as a group of four in a 2 bed cottage and loved every minute of it our hosts were attentive and helpful when it came to planning out itinerary as yosemite first timers   the south entrance to the park is 30 mins drive and the valley a further 4550 mins through beautiful scenery   breakfast in the garden was a particular highlight   we 100 will stay here againsherilee has taken a great deal of effort to ensure the best stay for her guests the decorative touches are lovely but she excels at the necessities no matter what you might need to hike in yosemite she has it hats raincoats walking sticks etc and she hasnt neglected the at home needswants either movies books guidebooks to plan your hikes its all there the room was extraordinarily comfortable the gardens amazing the home cooked breakfasts are to die for leaving early sherilee will pack you a to go with home made muffins fruit etc sherilee herself is warm welcoming and extremely knowledgeable about yosemite dont hesitate to ask her for the best hikes for what you like i have never recommended a place as highly as i do this onewe had such a great time there really we wished we had knows itll be so good and had booked another night the innkeepers are superb the rooms are marvelous they did so much to make our stay the best thank youwhat a find yes its some distance from yosemite 35 mins to park entrance and probably 90 mins to yosemite valley but its a stunning place and we were met with such a genuine warm welcome  we stayed two nights in clouds rest which is in the main house and has a balcony overlooking trees and mountains in the distance the room was big great comfortable king bed big tv with a huge selection of dvds bathroom with large tub and separate walk in shower   we followed the suggested itinerary from our host for a one day tour of yosemite and decided to get up early we were on the road by 0630 with our lovely breakfast to go with delicious homemade muffins would recommend doing this as it enabled us to stay ahead of the crowds all day   if you have multiple

very clean and nicely oversized with a jaccuzi   would stay againwhat a fantastic locale the rooms were clean perhaps recently remodeled but what makes the difference is the staff everyone was smiling said a sincere good morning and was attentive the food was great they have an evening reception and snacks and breakfast is included in your stay we will definitely be backi and my wife stayed here as a base whilst visiting yosemite national park for three  days the inn is located in a decent location outside of oakhurst which has all the necessities one could need   the check in experience was great and the chap who served was polite and nice they offered some nibbles waiting in our room which was a nice touch after a long drive from san fran   our room was clean and tidy though was a little smaller than i had hoped the jetted tub was a bit tired but worked fine and was a great shout after a long hike breakfast was nice but we only tried once given we were up super early each day they had offered to get up earlier to accommodate but i didnt think it was fair for them to do so  you get a feel for what a hotel is really like withrefer to photos of the filthy tile outside room filthy bathroom tiny tv way across the room  shelf blocking ac circulation light switch you cant turn off because of poor planning sun shining under the door gaudy tub filthy jets left after 1 night overpriced just to add to the horrorfrom the moment we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with such great customer service and hospitality through the workers and welcome cards the hotel is also in a location that is convent to visit yosemite everything the hotel provided was excellent in our small homewe stayed the summer cottage house like how convent and tasty breakfast was to the spacious areas of both the house and driveway which made parking simple the room also had a warm and homey feel to it with everything neatly placed and a fireplace even the breakfast that was provided was fresh and could even be delivered to you snacks and drinks were also accommodated for us as well during the evening reception which really sealed this hotel as a wonderful visit most important though was definitely thethe room and amenity were very nice i like their welcome snack bar wine fruits and pickles the breakfast was great there were options you could choose from the hotel was very clean and lovely we enjoyed our stay there very muchhounds tooth inn is just near the south gate of yosemite   it offers homestay atmosphere but the area has bad cellphone reception  slow wifi   room was clean  bathroom is small and noisy of fan sound  no elevator so it was hard to carry luggage through narrow stairsloved the rooms so quaint and very elegant we liked the food and the breakfast was amazing  chef was personable and accommodating  we would love to come again next time we will get the cabin looks so amazing thank the staff and chef for his amazing foodwonderful small hotel stayed for 3 nights and we were impressed by the high quality service excellent breakfast and loved the complimentary wine and snacks every evening room was fairly small but had everything you need including hot tub about an hour and 20 drive from yosemite valley but preferred staying in this area as close to a number of restaurants and more going on during the evenings highly recommend this placegreat service hospitality excellent breakfast consistent everyday our room was not cleaned everyday due to the pandemic but the staff was available if we needed anything if you are looking for a quiet place to relax after a busy day in the area they have wine and cheese  in the eveningsthe summer cottage was delightful we are locals but want a night alone for our anniversary room was very good sized however the bed  bedding was very uncomfortable the sheets  blankets were very stiff  itchy the bed was very hard i like a firm mattress and made a clanging sound every time you moved  the staff was amazing  very friendly  breakfast was delicious  cooked exactly like we asked  we missed the evening thing but it was offered to us anyways  check inout was very simple  the jacuzzi tub was fantastic as was the double showers heads in the bathroom  it was very clean  well maintained  besides the bed needing to be replaced the only thing i would suggest is an outside seating area to enjoy the beautiful areamy wife and i stayed four nights at the hounds tooth inn and were very happy with our stay  the staffs customer service was excellent the room was clean and comfortable and the location is very convenient for trips into yosemite  breakfast was great each day  we would be very happy to stay there againalthough we missed the sign coming from town at first turning into the inn was a pleasant end to the day  our room was at the end of the upstairs hall overlooking the valley behind it although there was another private property which could be seen  having a nice welcome note and a small tray of fruit in the fridge was thoughtful the fireplace would be nice in a cooler time of year but i did enjoy soaking in the jacuzzi after a long day hiking our bed was very comfortable too  we were back in time each evening for the wine and meatcheese board so we didnt even need to go out to eat  we really liked the preorder for breakfast choices  which was cooked to order by the private chef  no prepackaged food here  in fact we asked if there could be a go box made for ourwe greatly enjoyed the spacious room with fireplace and jacuzzi bathtub while sipping our wine from the even reception wonderful experience  adorable decorations throughout the inn and friendly staff the breakfast was delicious and filling as we headed out to yosemitelovely cozy hotel with very friendly service good breakfast and clean rooms location close to the south entrance of yosemite and really calm at night but still close to different restaurants and shops  we had a great stay definitely recommendedmy husband and i stay here for a 3 night trip to yosemite we drove about 40mins to the park every morning insider tip download the gypsy app for an amazing audio tour of the park the breakfast was delicious the bed was super comfortable and clean and we felt very safe there a big plus was the free wine and cheese they offered every evening my husband and i arrived on wednesday and were treated very warmly by shelby we enjoyed the evening receptions tremendously and the breakfasts were awesome and very filling which was very helpful since we knew we would be walking over 6 miles a day in yosemite the room was spacious and comfortable but could really use a table the bathroom is large but there also should be a side table to put your toiletries on the jacuzzi tub was nice and big but unfortunately when we tried to use it the water came out pink derek thought maybe it had something to do with the rain but he had no definite answer for us this was a big disappointment since this was the reason we booked this room we also had no hot water that afternoon and we both had to take cold showers another bummer wewe stayed in room 13 and had a great experience the room is beautiful and the surroundings are quiet and peaceful the breakfasts are amazing thank you chefs  evening wine pairings were quaint and the fire just added to the ambiance employees are polite and friendly cannot wait to return they were really kind welcoming and hosting us in their new like hotel it was a very positive experience that well always remember at the end of our vacation parking was big enough it was calm during the night especially we were satisfied with quality mattressloved the welcome letter and blueberry pie on arrival  breakfast fabulous with a different choice every day

complimentary charcuterie plate in our regrigerator that we really enjoyed dont miss the pepper jelly and cheese on bread rounds we woke the next morning to wonderful smells from the kitchen our prearragned breakfasts were served the moment we sat down in the dining room this is no continental breakfast  far more we ate near the fire and enjoyed the surrounding woods and fall colors the one suggestion i would offer would be to upgrade some of thei and my wife stayed here as a base whilst visiting yosemite national park for three  days the inn is located in a decent location outside of oakhurst which has all the necessities one could need   the check in experience was great and the chap who served was polite and nice they offered some nibbles waiting in our room which was a nice touch after a long drive from san fran   our room was clean and tidy though was a little smaller than i had hoped the jetted tub was a bit tired but worked fine and was a great shout after a long hike breakfast was nice but we only tried once given we were up super early each day they had offered to get up earlier to accommodate but i didnt think it was fair for them to do so  you get a feel for what a hotel is really like withlovely cozy hotel with very friendly service good breakfast and clean rooms location close to the south entrance of yosemite and really calm at night but still close to different restaurants and shops  we had a great stay definitely recommendedwhat a fantastic locale the rooms were clean perhaps recently remodeled but what makes the difference is the staff everyone was smiling said a sincere good morning and was attentive the food was great they have an evening reception and snacks and breakfast is included in your stay we will definitely be back room was comfortable cozy and clean hotel offers free wine and cheese every night at 810pm for guests to enjoy by the fire location was perfect for a 40 minute drive to yosemite breakfast was made to order and super tasty town had lots of restaurants and services 2minute drive away coffee and water providedmy husband and i stayed one night in the inn and were very pleased the english estate type home boasts 12 rooms  fresh paint and uncluttered decor made us feel at home arriving we were welcomed into a cozy space with lovely furnishings a cheery fire glass of wine and a helpful manager once in our room

plate in our refrigerator breakfast was absolutely amazing we will always stay here when were in the areamy wife and i stayed there couple weeks back its a cute boutique place a short drive from the yosemite park entrance spacious room with an oversized jacuzzi room was clean and well kept the staff super friendly appreciated that we had to reduce our stay by and day and they accommodated without any penalty   two highlights for us i sitting outside enjoying  a glass of wine and have two deers walk by and ii really good breakfast options to choose from and the chef doing a great job preparing each order  good spread of cheeses cookies and snacks in the afternoon to munch on although the wine could have been a better quality   all in all a great option and would recommend itour family recently stayed at this inn as our base for hiking at yosemite the location was perfect the staff were attentive and helpful throughout our stay however the chef deserves particular praise for his personal effort on the breakfast menu these meals were simply delicious he would also provide samples of new dishes as he was creating them for the staff they were all very sweet and knowledgable about the local hikes i was forewarned the halfdome would take 13 hours and it did  we hope our travels bring us back to this very special place  we wouldnt stay anywhere else thank you for an all around wonderful experience (Score: 0.2318)\n",

            "we just completed a three day stay at the yosemite rose  we had a phenomenal time the location was a perfect base for our yosemite trip as the yosemite rose was about twenty five minutes from the park entrance  our room was a comfortable space to relax after a day of hiking  desserts tea and port were provided in the late afternoonevening  in the evenings we also enjoyed playing board games and pool in the common spaces diane was a fabulous hostess the breakfasts she made each morning were delicious  each breakfast began with a fruit course followed by a main  diane was also kind enough to show us a nice stargazing spot on the property  we definitely hope to be backthis was our first bb and i must say the bar has been set pretty high not only was the house charming and clean but the hospitality was exceptional and breakfast was scrumptious the individual bathroom in our room was also a big win because the thought of sharing one with other guests was offputting we will definitely stay here again and would recommend this to anyone without hesitationa wonderful hideaway for someone who loves victorian style houses and secluded calm environment surrounded by roses and trees family spirit personal clean and comfortable awesome veranda where a authentic  delicious home made breakfast is served no tv set in the bedroom which we highly appreciated amazing sunset view  deserts and brandy in the afternoon we stayed there for two nights travelling around california we felt relaxed and refreshedi visit yosemite quite frequently and have stayed at the yosemite rose many times the inn is charming clean cozy and comfortable hospitality and service are always friendly and personal i noticed a reviewer mentioned the porch is fenced with gauze  they must not be familiar with screened porches one of my favorite experiences at the inn is having breakfast on the screened porch as the porch is surrounded by a garden with lots of lavender so it smells amazing and the sound of crickets is really charming in the winter time they serve breakfast inside at the big dining table as is the case with all bed and breakfasts the innkeepers set the menu each morning but they ask for dietary restrictions at booking and check in  im vegetarian and they alwaysi took my two boys here on our trip to yosemite  while the drive into the park is a long drive all the way to the middle of the valley there is a great waterfalls and swimming hole on the way and it is worth it to be in a quiet spot  the hosts are really nice and the breakfast is to die for  pure class  beautiful china wonderful screen enclosed deck gourmet food as the owner went to chef school and the ambiance of the place is just warm and inviting  it is quiet if that is what you are looking for  it was for me and even my two boys ages 9 and 11 loved the horses and being on a rural plot of land that takes the city right out of you  highly recommend and will be back next year if we do a raft trip  the raft trip meet up spot is 2 minutes down the road  i miss thewe absolutely loved our stay here we came for a family trip to yosemite this is a little bit away from the park entrance but definitely worth it the hosts were so friendly and willing to offer suggestions of places to go in and out of the park the breakfasts prepared by rebecca were something we looked forward to because they were so delicious and are personalized with garnish from their gardens we enjoyed breakfast on the screened in veranda which offered the nicety of being outside while sheltered from the heat and bugs the tables also had flowers from their garden we were asked immediately upon check in if we had any dietary restrictions and when another couple said that they were vegetarian tj offered to an acceptable alternative the room we stayed in was charmingthis was our first bb and i must say the bar has been set pretty high not only was the house charming and clean but the hospitality was exceptional and breakfast was scrumptious the individual bathroom in our room was also a big win because the thought of sharing one with other guests was offputting we will definitely stay here again and would recommend this to anyone without hesitationwhat a memorable experience ill be sure to tell everyone my favorite oart was waking up to the serene sound of nature i didnt want to leave but all good things must come to an end luckily my partner and i got lots of photosa wonderful hideaway for someone who loves victorian style houses and secluded calm environment surrounded by roses and trees

be back next year if we do a raft trip  the raft trip meet up spot is 2 minutes down the road  i miss theif you are looking for a place conveniently located for visiting yosemite this is not the place it is at least one hour drive from the park the house itself is old and dated we were told upon arrival we had the room with the jacuzzi taking a bath in a dated jacuzzi did not really appeal to us it took some gymnastics to be able to shower in this jacuzzi the rest of the house was quite dark breakfast was served in a veranda which was fenced of with gauze again not very appealing breakfast itself was very specific no personal choice every morning they would come up and tell us what they had prepared that morning  quiche or potatoes or a certain omelet it certainly wasnt bad but also not very good our bed was also never made during our stay i guess  that is notwe had a great stay at yosemite rose we stayed in the cabin with two couples it had everything we needed convenient to the park overly friendly staffthey even gave me a pillow on the day of our departure for my wife because of the rental car seat was killing her back i would highly recommend you stay therewe stayed here on a trip through yosemite  the reviews had attracted us to the place and it didnt disappoint  we turned up late afternoon and whilst there was noone to greet us but a letter was on the door with a code to get in and the little note saying there is cake port and brandy in the parlour  the areas of the house are open to you there is a pool table in a little room covered with military memorabilia  the rooms are quite spacious the decor of the house is old world with heavy furniture and drapes  there is a bathroom with a spa bath if you choose  there are a few family working dogs around the place they are friendly and dont really pester guests if you are not a dog lover  the room comes with breakfast which was so lovely home cooked for you and thewe enjoyed our stay at the yosemite rose  its very clean and well appointed  scelestia is the cook and did very nice breakfasts daniel help waiting tables and was very entertaining  all rooms are air conditioned  it is the perfect place for a getaway with no tv and real peace and quiet  its also one of the closest place to yosemite but that is still over an hour from yosemite village  however we would definite stay here againwe absolutely loved our stay here we came for a family trip to yosemite this is a little bit away from the park entrance but definitely worth it the hosts were so friendly and willing to offer suggestions of places

as part of a river rafting trip on the tuolumne this place was perfection the meeting spot for the rafting trips for all companies is right down the road so the location is ideal   the proprietors are very thoughtful and attentive the room was spotless and very beautifully decorated and air conditioned and had a very large jacuzzi tub which was just what we needed after a long day on the river   both of the proprietors are professionally trained chefs too so the included breakfast was excellent   will definitely returnbuilt to function as a bb this place has style and great hospitality  all the public rooms have well decorated  the bedrooms are large as are the bathrooms with spa and separate showers   lots of hospitality by the hosts great breakfasts in the morning and brownies or cupcakes at night with port wine and bourbon laid out for the taking  everything has been thought through and is done at the highest levels  give it a trymy husband and i spent a couple nights here during our 10 year anniversary trip it was a beautiful place our accommodations were cozy and very comfortable we enjoyed chatting with ms katherine and getting her advice on what to do at yosemite all the little toucheslike makeup wipes delicious nightly desserts  drink station and communal areas were so nice also they were extra kind to cook us breakfast at 7 so we could beat the crowds at yosemite the breakfasts were excellent  and we enjoyed eating on the patio our second morning there the room was spacious and the bathroom was roomy as well  we would definitely return thank yall for a wonderful experience my so and i arent really bb people but yosemite rose may have converted us we stayed in this amazing property in the mary room in june for three nights during our visit to yosemite national park scelestia and her husband on our last day made us a togo breakfast  complete with fresh pastries and fresh egg sandwiches  for our two early days as well as a delicious breakfast on our last day we enjoyed the fresh treats and port each night when we returned from our busy days in yosemite scelestia and her family were so friendly that we ended up staying an hour later on our last day just to chat with them the room size was perfect bed was comfy and showerhead was strong property in general is a farmhouse with nice quiet rooms the drive to the valley halfdome parkingthe breakfasts were prepared by a trained chef we couldnt wait to see what would be offered each morning our room was a lovely oasis the roses that give the bb its name were in bloom during our stay i literally stopped to smell the roses each time i passed bythe first night i set the thermostat temp at 70  the ac lowered the room temp to 70 but the thermostat preset program raised the setting to 75 a little later so the night time sleeping temp was warmer than i would have liked  the next morning i figured out that i needed to set the thermostat to hold the temp that i wanted  heaviest thickest bath towels ive every experienced  breakfast setting was very pleasant  breakfast was good but the pancakes lacked flavor except for the blueberries that were in them  the owners 12 year old daughter who showed us our room and showed us around the house when we arrived was pleasant but not as friendly and happy to have us as guests as i would expect the owners representative to be i chalk it up to her young age  theim so glad we didnt miss this beautiful experience and stay in yosemite national park in august  this home is very close to the entrance and a world away  our hosts really know how to run a fabulous grand and graceful welcoming but private country estateranch as a bb  you feel like a special family friend in their beautifully appointed home and waking up to the light and silence well maybe theres a horse chomping with views of the garden and golden grass hills is perfection  peaceful delicious breakfasts on the porch and interesting stories of this family a stroll past the new foal and new bird speciesmake you want to stay another day  i hope we canthis is a family run business and different members of the family help out at various times it is primarily aimed at adults and we did not see any kids during our stay the breakfast is different every day and is always a fresh home cooked meal the pastries in the afternoon are worth leaving the park early for and the port after dinner is a nice touch it is only a short drive to buck meadows and groveland for dinner each night and an hour to yosemite valleythis place is a gem an hour drive from yosemite valley this place is set beautifully in the nature the rooms are very clean and beautiful the family running this place is soooo nice and have great recommendations the breakfast was

            "stayed for a short city break  the hotel is a 1015 metro to the central for the eiffel tower and 5 minute taxi to notre dame  we did expect it to be quite far out but were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get to all the usual sites so if you are looking for something a little quieter away from the centre hustle and bustle this is perfect  this hotel is a bit diy with complimentary tea and coffee and a serve yourself breakfast with fresh pastries ham pancakes and boiled eggs  perfect start to a long days sightseeing  the hotel decor is qwerky cool and classy whilst the rooms are cosey and just right for a short stay  staff were more than happy to accommodate our request of a balcony over looking the city roof tops and flowers as a surprise for my partner  thejust stayed 2 nights in this hotel and i loved its simplicity style location staff room lounge area and breakfast the only thing i was a little disappointed in was the small selection of food on our arrival back from the first day tired and hungry there was a small selection of wholesome snacks as they dont have cooking facilities and the food has to be preorderedwe saw others eating it and it looked delicious  again wholesome and home made i hesitate in recommending it as it is a jewel in a sea of expensive and crapy parisienne hotels strangely the staff were lovely all of them an achievement in paris where redness seems to be norm braviits pretty obvious the vast majority of reviews of this hotel on the internet are written by the management at first it comes off as chic in an odd way but then its clear its more about marketing than the hotel itself there are even weird signs everywhere encouraging guests to post photos on social media with the message be a good part of the community   true the room are cute like many boutique hotels its designed to look like a nice apartment rather than a hotel the bed is also more comfortable than most hotel beds however i was shocked when i arrived because the room was by far the smallest of any hotel room ive ever stayed in you have about one meter on either side of the bed and half that in front of it the door to the toilet doesnt even fully open thiswe absolutely loved our stay at coq hotel all the cute carefully considered little details extremely comfy bed pleasing shower and beautiful big window with a french balcony were just some reasons why we absolutely fell in love with this hotel it made our stay in paris even more memorable3we loved everything about our stay  the hotel is beautifully decorated and very stylish the room amenities are good including lovely toiletries and everything you need for a short stay the service was great  warm and welcoming and it is well located for metro lineswe had a brilliant stay at this hotel on our long weekend to paris it is really well decorated we loved our room massive comfy bed huge shower gorgeous carpet all very much to our tastes we got a really good deal that include a welcome drink which included a few glasses of good wine and super yummy popcorn the location is good near place ditalie so walkable to the left bank breakfast was fabulous really good quality produce the bread and butter was to die for lovely staff too we loved our stay so much we even bought a bottle of their wine as a souvenirwould definitely recommend had a room with a balcony overlooking paris rooftops breakfast is fantastic lots of choice of high quality products decor was modern and trendy and rooms were excellent sizeits hard to find enough superlatives for this hotel right from the check in to the check out we were greeted by friendly and smiling staff the room was small  as expected in paris  but with a reasonably large and nice bathroom everything was in good condition the breakfast was great not the biggest selection but quality items slightly cramped at times  a little wait for a table to be expected nice location in relation to metro lines and the neighborhood seemed peaceful and quiet and then i have to mention that several times we saw the staff go glass  knives and forks etc through to make sure it was perfectly clean  as it was at a michelin starred restaurant would love to stay here again another timewe stayed at the coq hotel for 4 nights in mid may it was as good as the photos and reviews suggest stylish but not pretentious friendly helpful service and a substantial breakfast   we upgraded to the superior room for extra space staying in such a special place we looked forward to coming back to the 13 arrondissement every evening after long days sightseeing in the citythis is without doubt one of the best located hotels we have stayed at in paris location is perfect for walking five minutes from metro with multiple lines converging so no part of paris is out of reach staff are wonderful along with very well maintained and clean premises could not be faultedthis is a lovely hotel the rooms are charming in a minimalist way clean and with plenty of natural light the rooms have windows that can be opened the hotel has an intimate feel yet there is plenty of public space to relax or do work its location close to the place ditalie provides good access to public transport and the staff were helpful in providing information on how to get around the staff are friendly energetic polite wellinformed and speak some english the 24 hour availability of light food options and a machine for tea and coffee is especially welcome the breakfast options are good and the staff accommodated my dietary needs punctually and without fuss  i had an extended stay for work and would certainly stay again this is a gem of a placewe loved this hotel and would highly recommend it for its friendly staff comfortable beds lovely rooms and amazing breakfasts very relaxed and comfortable and well placed in terms of metro station a place ditalie we paid for a larger room which is not so big but this is paris and for the price we paid the size and atmosphere of the room was very fair very large and comfortable bed the bathroom had a bad but no separate shower parking is easy in the neighbourghood and if you like to park in a paid garage prices are 14th the price of more central parisi thoroughly enjoyed my 3night stay at coq hotel in a quieter part of paris conveniently located nearby the place ditalie station with 3 metro lines  the classique room size is standard for paris hotels  it is the thoughtful use of space and design that actually makes staying at this hotel a truly pleasant experience equally the staff were very welcoming and always willing to help delivering quality service  the breakfast at the hotel is lovely and there are also some good food options in the 13eme arr for dinner nearby after a day out  overall an excellent stay i highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting paris and looking to have a standout boutique hotel experiencei was stuck in paris as there was a rail strike and needed a nice place to sit and wait until i was picked up i was looked after immediately upon walking through the door celia was an absolute star the lounge area is to the right of the reception and is cool contemporary and elegant i had the house wine which at 18 euros a bottle was well priced i also had the meat and cheese board for 15 euros which easily fed two adults with loads left over really generous the staff could not have been more friendly they were both fantastic i forget the other guys name but he was amazing too it was so lovely that i returned on the following thursday on the way back to orly and had a few coffees there i adore this hotel and will absolutely be back as soon as im able tothis hotel had everything that you might expect from a 5 star hotel in terms of service helpfulness and atmosphere at the hotel   the place felt like a home away from home with the welcime drink on offer and the boardgames the music was perfect and promoted a wonderfully relaxed ambience i would definitely come againwhat i like the staff overall atmosphere of the hotel and location if metro works bit remarks when there is a metro strike a bit far from centre of paris  room a bit too dark  no refrigerator is the room  bathroom does not have proper extractor in the ceiling price is fine thoughplace ditalie is great spot for good asian restaurants but with the metro only a couple of minutes to the center of paris  the interior is great especially the choice of colours we had the deluxe room with an antique bath very cool i recommend this hotel try the soft boiled

owned by 2 sugar heirswhose designers had a clever concept   community of quality [coq  rooster]  highlighting quirky decor and chickens that got lost when the hotel became a cash machine for the owners new upscale venture    i am genuinely fond of the staff who try their best  staff turnover has been significant an reallocated and it shows  the mascot pet silky chickens are dead 1 or rehomed 3  the flea market decor remains but the cool clientele is vanishing  the community of quality concept exists largely in merchandising and graphics  during the week photo and film shoots often  leave guests with nowhere to sit at weekend breakfast you can struggle tole coq hotel is located in the 13th district of paris an up and coming neighborhood just steps away from the place ditalie metro station from which you can easily access all the top sites in paris  the hotel lobby has a chic modern decor with velvet sofas cool artworks and interesting coffee table books giving it the air of a stylish cocktail bar theres even a sitting area full of plants and glass skylights which feels like a parisian glass menagerie and sitting room around a cozy fireplace breakfast is a sumptuous spread of fresh baguettes croissants configures fruit yogurt cheeses and meats served in the airy dining room at the front of the lobby the hotel has an elevator which for those of us me included that cant seem to leave home without a giantwe throughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy spot close to the 5  6 train if you are comfortable using the metro we are new yorkers then this is the hotel for you about a 1015 minute train ride to all the major attractions and very easy to transfer to the airport bound trains we loved the design of the hotel very chic very clean and super friendly staff i left my adapter at home and they were kind enough to let me borrow one you saved me from an awful hair day thank you they also do a complimentary glass of wine from 6pm8pm and have a coffee station that you can use anytime of day stay here you wont regret itfantastic hotel uber cool furnishings and vibe  location not as central but certainly worth the extra journey time to enjoy it staff were welcoming and friendly breakfast and drinks were superb enjoyed the experience (Score: 0.4586)\n",

            "my wife and i spent 4 nights at this hotel which is located just a short walk from the gare de lyon train station and just steps from the bastille round about our room was in the back facing a side street and it was very quiet the metro has lines just steps away plus many good restaurants we ate at le coq rico in the monmartre a la biche au bois two blocks away au temps des cerises just on the marais border and les coquettes de christian constant close to eiffel all of these restaurants offer terrific food at reasonable prices the room at pavillon bastille had a small coolerand available coffee and teathere is a large grocery about 1 12 blocks toward the train stationthe entire hotel was clean and well taken care of breakfast in the basement was also very goodvery reasonably priced hotel that is wellkept booked directly on site and received free breakfast cant complain about the bedroom and bathroom  comfortable and clean  its located very close to bastille station 5 minute walk and possibly a 15 minute walk to gare de lyon if you are driving it is conveniently located in front of opera house parking stationthis hotel was a nice surprise after having spent many nights in noisy andor uncomfortable paris hotels a small place just off the place de la bastille and lots of activity the hotel is surprisingly quiet with low internal traffic ie hallway chatter the rooms come with whatever you need from a clothesline in the bath to a minibar the staff is very accommodating and friendly and the morning breakfast is yummy and plentiful plus the coffee machine is ready to provide whatever you like from an espresso to a big cup of classic coffee i will certainly return mercithe best bit of this hotel is the staff  very friendly helpful especially since we arrived during a rail strike special thanks go to indural  who organised taxi transport back to cdg when the rotten sncf were on strike and there were no trains our room was in a perfect position  top floor at the end so noone next door to disturb us our room was also facing a side street so we had no traffic noise we did not have breakfast as all hotels charge far too much so we went to a local cafe which was only five minutes away we had a good selection of tv programmes  cnn bbc world and a few french sports programmes the hotel is in an ideal place for metro bars restaurants and visiting the local area would stay there again in an instanta nice hotel in a typical old french area of paris close to the center very comfortable and simple room in an old building flowered a really discret and friendly ambiance a great place to visit pariscant fault the location staff are welcoming and helpful and the rooms are clean with pleasant lighting the beds are as small as they come comfortable enough and it means a bit more floor space for the suitcases great to have a kettle in the room as well as coffee facilities in reception would stay againthe room was very nice and clean  however we had the desk call us a taxi on the morning of 1082021 and the driver charged us 421 to go to beauvais airport  we did expect to pay about 150 because of what we had researched but this was definitely wrong  i hope they dont continue  calling this taxi companyvery clean and tidy place is reasonably priced especially for the time of year tour de france good location where you can easily get to locations by half hour to fourth five minute walk or public transport 5 mins away beds are comfortable breakfast was average for a buffetif the prices were higher for this small chic hotel it would be called a boutique hotel but the news here is that it is everything that boutique hotels are but without the crazy prices   our double room was nicely decorated with a super comfortable bed and sleek bed covers and soft go to sleep pillows easy access wifi was a huge plus  as were the hefty towels in the bathroom which were lovely after a hot shower caveat  the hair dryer is a little strange so if thats important you might bring your own travel hair dryer    the staff speaks english and could not have been nicer when our flight was cancelled we called from the airport and the front desk was very accommodating about just giving us our same room   breakfast comes with the room  also a big plus  soeverything you would expect from a threestar hotel good central location being a couple of minutes from the metro station room clean and good size for paris hotel with comfortable bed and good quality linen excellent buffet breakfast with fresh croissant and pastries we will use this hotel

point on the eurostar with only a short stroll from bastille metro stop the lady at reception when we arrived was warm and friendly and thankfully fluent in english as our french was very limited we found the room small but more than adequate for a couple who were there only to sleep the bed was very comfortable ensuring a restful sleep and the room cleaned daily with a safe in the room we felt confident that passports and credit cards were safely left there we did not have breakfast at the hotel so unable to comment on this the price did however seem quite reasonable particularly when considering the cost of meals in paris it needs to be noted that thevery convenient place for stay in paris excellent access to any transport nice staff quiet rooms good start point to discover galeries historic buildings or follow the life in streets from typical cafswe had a very enjoyable couple of nights staying in this hotel the bed was very large and comfortable and the breakfast selection was brilliant it is very well located for visiting paris and would definitely recommendwatch out if you stay here as my sister and i had money stolen from a locked bag in our hotel room not a good start to our holiday   otherwise it is a fairly standard hotel in a good location close to the gare de lyonthe hotel has clean rooms a good and rich breakfast the rooms were a bit small but it

centre at least for uswe had an overnighter here after finishing our 3 week cycle tour of southeastern france  the location was handy for getting cross town to gare du nord for our return leg  staff were friendly and couldnt really fault the room for a short stay  we might have been more forgiving due to our many nights under canvas on the bicycling tour   hotel has a useful side ramp for wheeled access to the lobby and a nice little gated outdoor area at the front   price was reasonable for paris and it was pretty much a standard type hotel  weve stayed in better and worse in our dozen or so visits to the cityfriendly nice little hotel clean budget about 100 eur per night are the first words coming to mind it is perfectly located at walking distance from bastille subway etc and also very close to the train station gare de lyon i walked there without problem  the room with 2 twin beds was spacious quiet thanks to good windows isolation a little noise from people passing through the corridor though with confortable bed simple but nice decoration and goodcreanfunctional bathroom the staff was very nice 24h   make sure to book directly from their website as the price is the same than other portals but more importantly they offer breakfast if you book with their site worth it to save a few bucks for a good and complete breakfast the croissants were to die formy husband and i stayed in this hotel for 8 nights on the first leg of our trip to europe in  september of 2019  we thought the hotel was very nice yes the rooms were a bit small but we did not feel cramped at all we had plenty of room for the little bit of time we spent in the room  we were surprised how quiet the area was  and we had a room facing rue de lyon it was very close to the bastille metro stop from where you could get everywhere after 8 days of riding the metro all over in paris we became very familiar with the system  the room and bathroom were very clean the bed and pillows comfortable we had

            "the hotel is on a small beautiful unknown square right next to the cnam on the right bank close to grand boulevard st martin areas and super accessible from the gare du nord or montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as

breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was

there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my

far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus

mohammad was just awful my friends and i went out for a night out and had to go wait outside for 20 minutes because of a sleeping mohammad he came to the door with his shirt wrinkled and looking super sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed and empty which was a complete lie the safe was open he hung up abruptly without giving me further information super sketchy and unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for

day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back (Score: 0.4042)\n",

            "we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of august 19 location is 510 minutes walk from the eiffel towerand plenty of nice bars and restaurants yet the hotel itself is very quiet and relaxing after a long day of site seeing very pricey area though so be prepared to spend 100 on a meal in the evening for two hotel was a small compact boutique that offers bed and breakfast waking up to the smell of fresh croissant was a win friendly staff at reception room was very small however for a short city break for 2 this was just fine price was no different from 3 nights at a premier inn in the uk would recommendi highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was very clean pretty the beds were very comfortable and the most important is the location youre going to be in the safest and most beautiful neighborhood in paris liliana mendozawe chose this hotel due to its excellent location  right next to the trocadero and short walks to the tour eiffel and arc de triomphe it is well positioned for a short city break  30mins from gard du nord on the metro  the facilities provided were good  clean room comfy bed ensuite  i was surprised though at what was not included in the room wifi is available but costs extra tea and coffee facilities are in reception not the room and again there is a charge there was a safe but no key provided  i assumed it similarly cost extra but may be wrong  so 35 because those things i would expect as standard were not provided without additional payment other than that it is a nice hotel in an excellent locationperfect location perfect friendly personal parking lot to reserve nearby good continental breakfast clean nice and good restaurant in neighborhood location also in very nice neighborhood tres bienthe hotel is near the trocadero place one of the best place to see the eiffel tower near the chaillot palace near also le muse des monuments franais le muse de la marine  its very well locatedwe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel very nice staff clean hotel  rooms very cute and instagrammable patio perfect location as usual we booked for the dinner which is always amazing and tasty cant wait to come back and thanks to the teamwe were forced to cancel our trip due to the pandemic and hotel longchamp was the only accommodation that would not work with us on obtaining a refund or even letting us change our dates to one year later they did offer us to pay a change fee to change our dates a few months later but didnt offer this until less then one week before our planned stay which was too late to coordinate with the rest of our already rescheduled trip hotel longchamp had ignored all communication with us when trying to deal with this in a timely manner our experiences with all our other various flight and hotel reservations etc really worked with us to refund or move our dates to a later time that all syncs up all in the same trip for this reason i cannot recommend this hotel they find any reasoni highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was very clean pretty the beds were very comfortable and the most important is the location youre going to be in the safest and most beautiful neighborhood in paris liliana mendozaperfect location perfect

hotel for 2 nights on holiday on arrival we left our bags as we were before the room was ready and on return our bags were put into our room and coats hung up in the wardrobe which was great the hotel room was a great size bathroom where toilet is a little small but great room and the beds so comfy we were able to add breakfast on the morning if we wanted when we woke up and the staff were really friendly as we didnt know paris very well the reception member got the map and identified all the main tourist attractions the two metro stations which the hotel is between and also gave us some great restaurants to visit which helped up a lot throughout the few days we stayed would highly recommend staying herewe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel

a review since we are so happy with this hotel it really lived up to the expectations that we had it is just as fresh as in the pictures friendly staff and central location recommend itmy stay in the hotel was unforgettable the rooms are very private and clean the bathroom is very neat as well the staff was friendly and welcoming makes me feel like home is near to trocadero so you can go a enjoy the view of the beautiful eiffel towerclean rooms friendly staff really feels like home  breakfast is nice everything is fresh and delicious  reception is at your service 247 and that is great  one disadvantage  you can hear the noise in the hall while being in your roomi have chosen this hotel several times and will certainly stay there again it has an excellent location both for touristic and business trips the rooms are clean and comfortable the hotel staff is very attentive and helpfulhotel is in a great location staff was pleasant and helpful rooms are very tight standard double end bed was literally less than a foot from the wall no floor space to open your bags carpet in room and stairwell is kinda old dark and not clean looking stairwells seemed darkrecently stayed here with my family i have a young baby and was still made to feel welcome which has been a problem when travelling previously  great location nice clean hotel i would definitely recommendmy family stayed in a triple room 2 adults 1 child at this lovely little hotel and loved it  the location could not be beat it was a few minute walk to the metro and only a couple more to the eiffel tower the hotel staff was so kind and nice the breakfast each morning was very tasty and the room was a good size for our family when we return to paris we will definitely stay here againthe area was good for restaurants and close to metro station the problem came when they stated that the room was handicapped accessible not even the entry was accessible there were stairs and a smaller than average doorways the bathroom was very small and the toilet room was so small that not only the door would not open farther than 13 of the way but you had to straddle the toilet to close the door the biggest problem was that the room was too small i know that paris has small rooms but this was like a closet i am not exaggerating there was also construction so ask if there still is any as it was very loudvery nice staff shout out to edris and brightaquad room was nice 4 sistersfirst time in parisand clean location couldnt be betterwalking distance to the eiffel tower and other tourist spots easily accessible by bus or metrotrainhighly recommenced as we will surely stay here again next time we visit parislocation 1010 the administration 1010 we were absolutely happy in this hotel hope to come back here again and again  i dont know what else to say so im writing something to tripadviser   good bey see u soonmyself and my partner are a young couple who had a very pleasant experience on our visit to paris on easter weekend we experienced the wonderful paris friday traffic jams lol when we arrived we received a warm welcome from the lovely man at reception it was quick he gave us a map with all the locations and told us the nearest metro station stayed in room 504 was a nice room my only criticism is that control of the aircon should be done from the room as i had to ask the receptionist but that was no bother as we did this when left in the morning to then come back to a very cool room as the weather was amazing and very hot i certainly would recommend this hotel for its location and the cafes  restaurant are just amazing thank you hotel longchamp elyseesi first stayed here in 1984 and when it came time to visit again with my wife we did so this spring  the hotel is a small family affair where the front desk and other staff know you by name after the first night  it is close to two metro lines and within walking distance to the bois de bologne champs elysees eiffel tower trocodero museums and more and there are many good restaurants bistros chinese sushi portuguese patisseries the accommodations are first rate and the amenities are superior  looking forward to visiting again and soonmy husband and i stayed here for our ruby wedding anniversary and it is a fab hotel centrally situated near the eiffel tower and just a short walk from larc de triomphe metro station just a few minutes walk from hotel the staff here are so nice and really helpful we would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to paris bernie  patsywe had a great four night stay at hotel longchamp elysees the staff was very welcoming and willing to assist from the moment we arrived arriving on a saturday we had concerns about the protest but they immediately pulled out a map and explained areas we should avoid the rooms were on the smaller size  to be expected but were clean and well kept planning to be out for the majority of the day and returning late at night we were a little hesitant that we had to leave our hotel key at the desk but there was always someone there when we arrived back at night the location was great to easily travel by metro and the staff was more than willing to accommodate holding our luggage on our last day would certainly recommendnice hotel in paris france near the eiffel tower  great staff very helpful  room was small but comfortable and safe  no refrigerator in the room but europe doesnt usually provide refrigerators in rooms anyway  very small hotel but near many cafes metro and sightseeing  best hotel we stayed in during our tripi generally do not write poor reviews however i would not stay here again at all no lift to the room as you can see by the spiral staircase photos no offer of assistance to the room with baggage for my 70yr parents walls paper thin i could here kids yelling at all hours the ac is not controlled by you in your room the door key had to be left with front desk for the day its 2019 invest in proper doors locks the male at the front desk clerk was extremely rude  camille you were lovely and tried to make up but at some point you have to cut your losses  the food for breakfast what food eggs not cooked 2 baguettes small pieces of cheese a feeble pieces of ham etc disappointing decent location the eiffel tower was close and that is the best i can say for thislong champs elysees hotel is great exceeded my expectations few walks to restaurants grocery stores and to eiffel where it is great to see at night breakfast is great chooses are many hotel size is good bathroom is really spacious  hotel has mini english garden to smoke eat has concierge service that keeps your belongings safely hotel is clean  quiet   certainly will recommend to friends and family (Score: 0.3947)\n",

            "the hotel is on a small beautiful unknown square right next to the cnam on the right bank close to grand boulevard st martin areas and super accessible from the gare du nord or montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as the best location clean and amazing staff it not fussy but to an elegant high standard it makes your trip feel wonderful and special i visit and recommend to everyone as it makes your paris trip even more perfectcomfortable nicely designed rooms   we had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing cuts out the traffic noise no kettle in room but they were very happy to send up a pot of boiling water for us to make tea excellent breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff close to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placethe little palace hotel as its

to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsthis hotel was a great little find close to everything staff were amazing and very helpful hotel room was small but very clean and comfortable breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my

would love to stay there againthis is the second time we stayed in this hotel and we were again very satisfied location and service are very good from the gare de lest you can easily walk to the hotel  as last time we had a room to the inner court that was very calmgreat place to visit paris clean romantic rooms amazing staff good breakfastbuffet love this place 5stars this hotel is close to gare du nord train and metro on walking distance a lot of restaurants surrounding the hotel even a great market with oysters and wines a supermarket next to the hotelwithin walking distance of the gare du nord in a road appropriately called the street of small hotels the hotel frontage is very small  so is the rest of it  tall and narrow built around a small courtyard rooms are small but well equipped and the breakfast buffet is  by french standards at least  quite reasonable scrambled eggs bacon and sausage very helpful staff at receptioni spent three nights in this well located hotel  the team was warm and really helpful also sanitizer and masks are available for customers  the room was of decent size for a hotel downtown top notch quality matress  i highly recommend this hotelstylish and warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in paris and needed to hit the sights prior to our check in time and the reception staff at the hotel were very friendly and allowed us to store our case until we came back to the hotel later that evening we also had use of the comfortable lounge after our check out time and prior to our departure on the eurostar the following evening  a very nice stylish hotel conveniently situated we would definitely stay again if we came back to pariswe stayed here a few years back  returnded as it left such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the

quiet which is a miracle considering its right in the centre of the city you practically fall out of gare du nord and into the hotel it has a big atrium where you can have breakfast the breakfast itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water pressure i got in the shower its the

made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord near the first day lunch placebrasserie flodere and easy to get elsewhere just lovely helpful staff which makes all the difference  nothing too much trouble and super friendly also great breakfast

            "stayed for 4 nights at lumieres monmartre and had a pleasant enjoyable experience staff are helpful and polite and speak english well  the rooms are modern very clean and cozy and there is minimal noise from the street outside the nearest metro station is around 10 mins walking and links to anywhere in the city  there is no installed air conditioning but rooms have fans that are quiet and keep you cool on warm days  would not hesitate to book here againnice clean modern rooms small but to be expected in pairs shop across the road cute restaurant s and bakery nearby  not too far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus

mohammad was just awful my friends and i went out for a night out and had to go wait outside for 20 minutes because of a sleeping mohammad he came to the door with his shirt wrinkled and looking super sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed and empty which was a complete lie the safe was open he hung up abruptly without giving me further information super sketchy and unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for

day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back (Score: 0.2157)\n",

to many sites we will return to stay here on our next trip to paristhe service the staff the bedroom amenities the level of cleanliness everything was perfect during our ten day stay here at fauchon this was one of the best stays of my life they made our honeymoon stay so memorable thank you everyone and a special thanks to salima and paul for being the absolute best raphael as well who was a great concierge and recommended great restaurantswe had a perfect stay there might be hotels with a more opulent  interior design a grand lobby and  a bigger spa but there are hardly any hotels which could beat the  standard of hospitality this hotel provides  even before the arrival the hotel provided a personal and warm email correspondence asking for special needs and wishes in advance  the checkin  took place in the library in a very cosy and personal atmosphere a welcome drink and macarons were provided and even the manager on duty  joined for a little chat not only was he present at the checkin he was also a helping hand like and among  the rest of the team always present looking after the guests needs and always around to make you feel comfortable there is hardly anything one could have  asked for  more asa beautiful location for a lovely weekend in paris amazing design position and very kind hospitality  a plus the grand cafe fauchon is a beautiful spot for breakfast and dinner in the center of paris and it is useful if you have babies as well you can eat there and than go upstairs in your super cozy parisienne roomthe team at htel fauchon did a superb job they were very helpful and went out of their way to predict our needs and make us feel welcome the room was well laid out the bed was comfortable and the food was good fauchon does a better job than many more expensive and better known hotels it is a gemi visited the restaurant of the hotel a few days ago and was impressed  i am parisian living the london and i know and experience the benchmark of restaurants in paris is very high especially in the last few years with a lot of openings and new concepts  the restaurant fauchon exceeded my expectations both on service and food  smoked salmon and risotto were divine and dont miss their iconic desert the bisou bisou  staff is friendly and engaging all against the background of the beautiful madeleine i will be back soonwe are seasoned travelers who have stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world many boasting luxury rating however this hotel is by far the best by any account first all the staff at the hotel is amazingly attentive kind and helpful the entire hotel is impeccably clean and well appointed the chef is fantastic and the service at the cafe is great our room was lovely clean and a perfect combination of modern and traditional french charm and decor we had the best anniversary trip ever and were so spoiled by the hotel it has never been more difficult to leave a place and come back to reality we are now eagerly awaiting an opportunity to go backthe check  in the library room is a great professional and warm welcome the room is  very  confortable and elegant  with touchful accessories  the room bar is a design furniture piece with tasty fauchon products breakfast on the terrace is perfecton my first stay back since covid i am pleased to advise that the standards at this hotel remain as high as ever  sitting in the cafe fauchon on my last of a five night stay memory fails me when i try to recall a hotel experience that offers comparable style service and hospitality  this hotel combines the feel of an intimate boutique property with the world class service of the most elite properties  its meteoric rise in the tripadvisor rankings is well deserved i will miss the warm and genuine greetings from front desk staff the luxurious room and the sweet gestures from management who went out of their way to make me feel welcome looking forward to stay 5i had a wonderful experience at the fauchon hotel in paris every staff member i encountered from the valet to the check in to the cleaning staff were delightful and eager to help thank you will certainly recommend to my friends and colleaguesfauchon has the best service of any hotel in all our years of traveling the hotel itself is impeccable and extremely centrally located in paris from the moment we arrived at their doors to the time we departed  the

friendly and always helpful  i felt very comfortable every day in this warm atmosphere if i travel to paris again i will definitely stay at the fauchon  thank you so muchfauchon is a lovely five star boutique hotel in the 8th arrondissement we stayed six nights in a prestige suite which was huge and felt like having our own paris apartment  the decor is fun and very modern bed and linens are luxurious amenities include an inroom snack bar nespresso maker dyson hair dryer and a toto toilet dinner in the restaurant our first night was excellent and the street level cafe is a great place to grab an afternoon glass of wine location close to rue  du faubourg sainthonore and multiple metro lines was ideal but what really made the experience special is the staff who were without exception friendly and  helpful throughout our stay (Score: 0.2081)\n",

and the hostel is nice everything is clean and the beds are nice  the only thing is that you have to bring your own padlock to lock your suitcase so remember to bring that didnt get to try the food just go herebarry made my night cant recommend enough i cant get into specifics even though trip advisor requires 200 character which is annoying by the way i as an irish american from new york i was honored to meet a real irish person in the beautiful city of parisbarry is the best bartender in paris cheers great bar the food was amazing drinks have good prices and they atmosphere is always great music is good and you always meet new and nice people come to belushis gare du nord asap beautiful hostel with nice people and a cool atmosphere barry made the cheese and wine night a very pleasant

for recommending drinks and had a great spirit made my holiday in paris great craic altogethergreat atmosphere in the bar fantastic staff  was lucky to be served by the excellent barry on our first

location special regards to my friend barry the barman very very nice 100 recommended  nevertheless tripadvisor obliges me to write 200 words as minimum wich is bloody ridiculousprivate room is extremely satisfactory great location in the city with ease of access to all amenities coming from the uk we find it hard to communicate in french but the bartender barry gave us many suggestions on the local area and made our stay at the bar a great night hats off to him for great servicei usually like hostels as they are more affordable and social compared to hotels a tradeoff in comfort is part of the deal  unfortunately this hostel was not for me the signiture barnightclub of st christophers inn is located at the hart of the hostel giving al rooms with a courtyard view entertainmant throuought the night good if you like to party the night away but not if you just want a decent nights sleep  additionally i was grossed out by my pillows even though they had clean cassings the verry sharp sweat odor was unbearable   not my best hostel experiencewonderful hostel everythings clean and the people are so nice even in a 10 bed room very good to stay there  especially the barkeeper barry made us feel welcome and made sure everyone was socializing well  also the train station is 2 minutes away which was very good when ill go to paris next time i know where im gonna stayi have only had the pleasure of spending one night at the st christophers inn but i have had so much fun and made so many friends  if you are looking for parisian nightlife this is the place to go   we were given a free workshop on making mojitos by barry it was so awesome  i would recommend this hostel to any students traveling on a budget looking to have some funwe really enjoyed our recent stay at st christophers inn the hostel was perfect for our needs and located close to the train station one of the highlights of our stay in paris was an evening spent in the adjoining bar where our fellow irishman  barry made sure the drink was flowing and everyone was in good form i would definitely recommend this hostel and bar  ive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems to take it as an argument for the bathrooms to be uncleaned showers and toilets were not clean corridors have no end and you have to pass multiple doors from the elevator to finally get to your room i felt like i was sleeping in a warehouse there was no air con and some people had problems with their windows that would not open good to mention that gare du nord is a crappy neighborhoodsuch a good vibe at the hostel a perfect place to meet new people and socialise  easy when bartender barry is on the job making sure everyone is having fun and never an empty glass i can only recommend this place to all travelling by yourself or with a friendamazing staff and customer service the trip was amazing the customer service was amazing you are greeted at reception by lovely staff and the atmosphere as amazing  5 star would defo about visit againparry the irish was great he taught us how to make mojitos and made us feel very welcome here we met lots of people from around the world and there was just a really great vibe inside the bar with all the other travelers we hope to go to stchristophers inn in other countrieswhen we made a reservation and went to the hotel they said that it was impossible for us to pay cash and that was the procedure  another customer who was there asked to pay to help us and we were going to give him cash  but the woman at the reception said very harshly that such a thing was not possible it was our last day in paris or even in france  we were in a panic and they were never helpful  they were very rude  they took cash payment for the two people who came after us but they told us it was impossible the rudest owner people i have ever seen i am so unhappy that they made our

small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as the best location clean and amazing staff it not fussy but to an elegant high standard it makes your trip feel wonderful and special i visit and recommend to everyone as it makes your paris trip even more perfectcomfortable nicely designed rooms   we had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing cuts out the traffic noise no kettle in room but they were very happy to send up a pot of boiling water for us to make tea excellent breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff close to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placethe little palace hotel as its

to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsthis hotel was a great little find close to everything staff were amazing and very helpful hotel room was small but very clean and comfortable breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my home\n",

nord in a road appropriately called the street of small hotels the hotel frontage is very small  so is the rest of it  tall and narrow built around a small courtyard rooms are small but well equipped and the breakfast buffet is  by french standards at least  quite reasonable scrambled eggs bacon and sausage very helpful staff at receptioni spent three nights in this well located hotel  the team was warm and really helpful also sanitizer and masks are available for customers  the room was of decent size for a hotel downtown top notch quality matress  i highly recommend this hotelstylish and warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in paris and needed to hit the sights prior to our check in time and the reception staff at the hotel were very friendly and allowed us to store our case until we came back to the hotel later that evening we also had use of the comfortable lounge after our check out time and prior to our departure on the eurostar the following evening  a very nice stylish hotel conveniently situated we would definitely stay again if we came back to pariswe stayed here a few years back  returnded as it left such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this hotel is almost exactly halfway between gare d est and gare d nord excuse spelling  there is a food store three doors down  the breakfast buffet was delicious and very

quiet which is a miracle considering its right in the centre of the city you practically fall out of gare du nord and into the hotel it has a big atrium where you can have breakfast the breakfast itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water pressure i got in the shower its the perfect place for a trip to pariseverything in this hotel is superb value for money cleanliness  the staff could not be more helpful  everybody was excellent but a special thank you to garmial at

made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord near the first day lunch placebrasserie flodere and easy to get elsewhere just lovely helpful staff which makes all the difference  nothing too much trouble and super friendly also great

            "stayed for 4 nights at lumieres monmartre and had a pleasant enjoyable experience staff are helpful and polite and speak english well  the rooms are modern very clean and cozy and there is minimal noise from the street outside the nearest metro station is around 10 mins walking and links to anywhere in the city  there is no installed air conditioning but rooms have fans that are quiet and keep you cool on warm days  would not hesitate to book here againnice clean modern rooms small but to be expected in pairs shop across the road cute restaurant s and bakery nearby  not too far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus

mohammad was just awful my friends and i went out for a night out and had to go wait outside for 20 minutes because of a sleeping mohammad he came to the door with his shirt wrinkled and looking super sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed and empty which was a complete lie the safe was open he hung up abruptly without giving me further information super sketchy and unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for

day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back\n",

and the hostel is nice everything is clean and the beds are nice  the only thing is that you have to bring your own padlock to lock your suitcase so remember to bring that didnt get to try the food just go herebarry made my night cant recommend enough i cant get into specifics even though trip advisor requires 200 character which is annoying by the way i as an irish american from new york i was honored to meet a real irish person in the beautiful city of parisbarry is the best bartender in paris cheers great bar the food was amazing drinks have good prices and they atmosphere is always great music is good and you always meet new and nice people come to belushis gare du nord asap beautiful hostel with nice people and a cool atmosphere barry made the cheese and wine night a very pleasant

location special regards to my friend barry the barman very very nice 100 recommended  nevertheless tripadvisor obliges me to write 200 words as minimum wich is bloody ridiculousprivate room is extremely satisfactory great location in the city with ease of access to all amenities coming from the uk we find it hard to communicate in french but the bartender barry gave us many suggestions on the local area and made our stay at the bar a great night hats off to him for great servicei usually like hostels as they are more affordable and social compared to hotels a tradeoff in comfort is part of the deal  unfortunately this hostel was not for me the signiture barnightclub of st christophers inn is located at the hart of the hostel giving al rooms with a courtyard view entertainmant throuought the night good if you like to party the night away but not if you just want a decent nights sleep  additionally i was grossed out by my pillows even though they had clean cassings the verry sharp sweat odor was unbearable   not my best hostel experiencewonderful hostel everythings clean and the people are so nice even in a 10 bed room very good to stay there  especially the barkeeper barry made us feel welcome and made sure everyone was socializing well  also the train station is 2 minutes away which was very good when ill go to paris next time i know where im gonna stayi have only had the pleasure of spending one night at the st christophers inn but i have had so much fun and made so many friends  if you are looking for parisian nightlife this is the place to go   we were given a free workshop on making mojitos by barry it was so awesome  i would recommend this hostel to any students traveling on a budget looking to have some funwe really enjoyed our recent stay at st christophers inn the hostel was perfect for our needs and located close to the train station one of the highlights of our stay in paris was an evening spent in the adjoining bar where our fellow irishman  barry made sure the drink was flowing and everyone was in good form i would definitely recommend this hostel and bar  ive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems to take it as an argument for the bathrooms to be uncleaned showers and toilets were not clean corridors have no end and you have to pass multiple doors from the elevator to finally get to your room i felt like i was sleeping in a warehouse there was no air con and some people had problems with their windows that would not open good to mention that gare du nord is a crappy neighborhoodsuch a good vibe at the hostel a perfect place to meet new people and socialise  easy when bartender barry is on the job making sure everyone is having fun and never an empty glass i can only recommend this place to all travelling by yourself or with a friendamazing staff and customer service the trip was amazing the customer service was amazing you are greeted at reception by lovely staff and the atmosphere as amazing  5 star would defo about visit againparry the irish was great he taught us how to make mojitos and made us feel very welcome here we met lots of people from around the world and there was just a really great vibe inside the bar with all the other travelers we hope to go to stchristophers inn in other countrieswhen we made a reservation and went to the hotel they said that it was impossible for us to pay cash and that was the procedure  another customer who was there asked to pay to help us and we were going to give him cash  but the woman at the reception said very harshly that such a thing was not possible it was our last day in paris or even in france  we were in a panic and they were never helpful  they were very rude  they took cash payment for the two people who came after us but they told us it was impossible the rudest owner people i have ever seen i am so unhappy that they made our
