At the western end of Charles Bridge, it is in a small, quiet square and occupies two buildings, the main hotel and the Depandance building which is across the square.  Both buildings are of similar, traditional design.  Our room was huge, spotlessly clean and equipped with everything we required.  We loved the personal touches - returning in the evening to find treats awaiting us.  These ranged from confectionary to Champagne.  The buffet breakfast, served in the main hotel by cheerful attentive staff, was a feast which prepared us for a day's sightseeing.

We were offered refreshments while the formalities of checking in was done.  We were also made aware of the honesty fridge with beers, wine and other drinks at our disposal. Very convenient.

The staff are very friendly, the location is five star with its proximity to the square and transportation. The breakfast buffet is nice with a good selection to choose from. The rooms however are disappointing. When we checked in we were given a room that was nice and looked to be recently renovated with no carpet (which was nice) the shower was a big problem though as it filled with water and barely drained. The tv was probably the smallest tv I had ever seen in a hotel and it didn’t even work. So with these issues I requested a different room.

The apartments we stayed in were both excellent ( stayed twice for 3 nights each time, one week apart) They were well equipped and clean. Very little  noise and a lovely atmosphere . Great value for money. The building was very old (14 th century ?) so we totally understood why there was no lift ! The stairs were manageable even for this very unfit nearly fifty yr old however, if you do suffer with limited mobility you may find it difficult - I suspect the staff would go out of their way to help you in anyway they could- they were magnificent !

Each bed had a blanket, pillow & pillow case, and mattress cover. I’ve stayed at many hostels and to my memory they’ve all provided sheets, so this was new. Anyway, if I were to stay again I’d bring my own twin sized sheets. There were no bugs or anything, so that’s good. The bathroom was large and clean. The room itself was clean.

231,Really nothing bad to say about this restaurant and hotel.  Clean and clean bathrooms and rooms.  Food was very good in the restaurant but the staff didn't seem to be up to the job of serving.  First day they told us breakfast was being served only but after we had decided on breakfast then they said lunch menu only was being served.  We were seated on the street near the door with much traffic of servers constantly.  We could have been seated inside as this is a large place with many floors.  We chose to sit outside.

Super professional people at the reception desk who gave us very practical tips on where to go, what/where to eat, currency excange and so on.

The first disappointment was that no staff was at the bar, the bartender was smoking on the terrace and even though he saw us, he didn’t get bothered to come back to serve us. Another guest who was going outside for a cigarette told him that we are still there. We ordered a Long Island Ice Tea/ the most expensive cocktail on the menu/ and what we got was just.....kind of rum and coke style drink with two ice cubes. What a joke. I politely asked the bartender for crushed ice but his response was that they don’t have any. We just left straight after.

The hotel is located very close to the Charles Bridge, so it is easy walking distance to all the historic sites.  The only bad thing about the area is there is a disco-bar on the ground floor facing the river, and they play super loud disco-music all night long (so we had to sleep with ear-plugs, and even then could still hear the loud beat).",October 2021,"56    Charles Bridge Palace

368,We stayed here as part of a group just before Christmas 2019.  Check in was quite quick considering the size of the group. We found it easier to take our own suitcases to the room as our guide recommended we keep our eye on them at all time.  This is not a reflection of the honesty of the hotel but rather of the necessity of making sure one keeps ones belongings on footpaths etc. our room was at the back of the hotel and looked out over some gardens to the hills beyond which made for a very pleasant and quiet outlook. Our room which had a king sized bed was very clean and had a separate shower and toilet.Breakfast on the first floor was plentiful and perfectly adequate for our short stay. The hotel was very convenient.  Straight out the front of the hotel was the Christmas,December 2019,"73    Adria Hotel Prague

A supermarket and a few restaurants are also close by. Everything else is so-so. The staff attitude is jus ok and nothing more. Many rooms are without air conditioning, so be careful when booking. Breakfast is very basic, close to the poor. I don’t think it is worth  wasting time and money for it. In addition, they decided to prepare plates with some sort of portions instead of a buffet breakfast. This causes a lot of unnecessary waste (wrapping foil).",June 2021,"74    Adeba Hotel

However the week before we were due to arrive both Czech and UK governments started reintroducing restrictions which got more severe as the week went on. We complied with everything but the day before departure further restrictions were introduced requiring negative Covid tests within 48 hours before return to the UK.  We slept on it but the consequences of 1 of us proving positive and having to isolate alone abroad for 10 days was just too much of a risk.  We wouldn't know our results until the day we were meant to return so wouldn't be relaxed at all during our stay.

On check in I met Alex who was a total gentleman - told me where to visit in Prague and if I needed anything just to ask. Its service with a smile and anything I asked Alex he answered and I could not wait to explore Prague. I checked into my room and was really surprised with how much I paid and what I got for my money as in I was very happy! - Minibar in the room, spotlessly clean, really comfortable beds and pillows - controllable heat - usually I cannot sleep in hotels as I cant control the heat but I was able in La Boutique and I really had a gorgeous nights sleep.

463,"I travelled to Prague alone in the end of November and stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is slightly outside the city centre in Prague 5 district, but it is still easily accessible to the centre and the main attractions in Prague 1 district.  I found myself not needing to use the public transport at all as I walked everyday to the central areas, it takes about half an hour give and take, but I didn't mind as I like walking anyway.  I often came back late after a full day of exploring and I felt the area of the hotel was safe too. Upon check in, I was actually early but I asked if there was a room available. Luckily, they were able to locate me a room when I arrived.  When I entered the room, it was a nice cosy room with double bed but there was a pillar right at the end of the",November 2019,"92    La Boutique Hotel

464,"We booked two double rooms months ago as the location of the hotel was good and it looked reasonable for the price. On arrival we were met by a young lady who wasn’t a people person, basic info and advised our rooms were in another building somewhere on the other side of the next block, circa 250m. It took a while as there was no sign of the hotel name and the old door lock was dodgy. It became apparent that these were two rooms in a residential building and not a hotel at all... the rooms were clean enough and maintained every day but the walk to the hotel for breakfast in the rain was a pain.  I feel the hotel should advise potential boomers that this will be the case prior to booking, just to be honest and clear.  No idea what the main hotel is like so can’t comment.... isn’t",February 2020,"92    La Boutique Hotel

466,"I stayed here for 3 nights in a 4-bed private room with 3 other travellers whilst backpacking around Europe. The reception area is a bit peculiar and very small, but check-in was easy and efficient. Lift will only fit one person with a large backpack in, so considering we were on the 4th floor this was a minor concern as the stairs were killers. Room was incredibly hot but that was due to the fact that we stayed during one of the hottest parts of the year. Beds very comfortable, and the communal kitchen area was good too. Shower a bit dodgy with no head holder, making it a tad awkward to use. On one particular morning one of the travellers I stayed with had a bit of an 'accident' in the night - which cleaners dealt with brilliantly with no fuss.

I also emailed and asked if towel was provided, and I've got replied saying yes it's available in the room.   Got there, the man at the reception made a lot of comments what he thought was funny while giving me the room key and gave me a sheet with passwords on it (main door, gate, room).   Got to my room, it's got 8 beds in it and I wonder if I'm having the whole room by myself, and also there's no sight of towels.

There were lots of trams available just a few mins walk away, and the public transport system is very good. We bought a 3 day pass for 310 CZK which gives unlimited use of public transport for that time , just over £10, Trams are very abundant and run every few mins. We booked a standard room and it was sufficient for our stay, The room was clean, with twin beds, bathroom with shower, plenty of hot water. Hairdryer, safe, refrigerator and wifi included, the safe was an extra few CZK per day. Breakfast was included and was a typical continental style, but plenty of it.

He helped us figure out how to get to places and recommended us things to do, even researching on his own.   However the receptionist during the day made us leave prague on a terrible note. We had some cks left so we wanted to take a taxi to the train station rather than an uber which we knew would cost more but wanted to get rid of the cash.  We asked the guy to call us a taxi- we stood there thinking he did for 10 mins but realised he didn't- so we asked again.
