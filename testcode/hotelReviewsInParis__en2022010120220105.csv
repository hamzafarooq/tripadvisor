0,"Location: maybe the best about the hotel is its location, walking distance from Champs-Élysées and Arc de Triomphe, was the most enjoyable part of our trip walking around, it is also near multiple bus stops and train stations  Room: room is clean and nice, bathroom is good, a bit on the small side but understandable given it was a relatively cheap room. a downside are the walls aren't noise proof, but ok i think, i am a light sleeper but didn't bother me.  Service: excellent, people are nice and understanding, attending to our requests fast and efficient, breakfast is very good and fresh staff speaks very good english, and arabic as well which was nice  all in all i enjoyed staying there",December 2019,"0     Hotel Elysees Flaubert

1,"The hotel is located in a more residential area but close to Champs-Élysées, it’s quiet yet full of great restaurants and artisan Boulangerie around there. Les demoiselles, Maison Rostang, Il était une oie dans le Sud Ouest, La Table Du Cabiste bio time name a few.   There is also a street market 3 min from the hotel, Rue Poncelet market which sells freshest fruits & veg, cheese , bread and seafood.   The hotel room was bigger than expected and the bathroom was of good size with proper bathtub. The staff was friendly and helpful, every time we went out and came back to the hotel, we got a greeting from the front desk. We stayed for a total of 6 nights,Good value for money, all in all  we had a very enjoyable stay. Only wished we could stay longer !",October 2019,"0     Hotel Elysees Flaubert

3,"The hotel is pretty well situated just 10 minutes away from the Champs-Elysées. It’s on a quiet back street which means a quiet nights sleep. The rooms are very basic but adequate. The bed is pretty comfortable so no complaints there. Our shower drained dreadfully slowly and it looks as though there should be a door on it.  The hotel could really do with some updating. Dark and dingy corridors and the stairs are also a very dark brown.  Breakfast is very basic and I do think for 14€ it’s a bit of a rip off for some week old apples and a coffee, there are a few pastries as well but given the room that there is for dining I guess that’s all there’s room for.  So 3 stars to match its rating in general.  Don’t be put off though, it’s warm and comfortable and convenient.",October 2019,"0     Hotel Elysees Flaubert

You can walk to many famous sites, or take the metro nearby. We were warmly welcomed by Manon at Reception, who not only stored our bags but also offered us breakfast! Thumbs up to the staff for their friendliness and efficiency. Great breakfast buffet. Hot and cold drinks as well as snacks are available at no charge all afternoon in the lounge.

From the explanation of the hotel, how we can use other Astotel hotel services in the local area, to the support we required for a lost passport, the staff was top notch & exceeded any expectations we could have had.  The complimentary breakfast and snacks were a nice touch along with the free, non-alcoholic mini bar.  The room was more than adequate size wise & had the basic amenities we needed.  What makes this place stand out for me was the staff.  Their companion & support for a very stressful situation was above and beyond.  When we notified that a passport was missing less than 48 hours before check out, they went into action.",December 2021,"1    Hotel Malte - Astotel

The staff is AMAZING, every single one of them went out of their way to make us feel welcome, and we had a nice tray of sweets with a personal letter waiting on our room the night we arrived.

The hotel is absolutely amazing, so beautifully and classically designed, very clean and its location is just perfect, as it is situated on a quiet street just off the Champs Elysee. There are two metro stations within a 5 minute walk, which is very convenient.  The staff were so lovely and very helpful, providing useful information also regarding COVID-19 policies in Paris. The breakfast was delicious, and the hotel also offers a free open snack bar from 2PM to 2AM. The room was beautiful and cozy. It was cleaned daily, spacious and had a free of charge minibar which was filled every day.

For this trip, my wife and I decided to once again stay at this hotel for the Paris portion of our honeymoon (we went from London, to Paris, to Brussels, and finally, to Amsterdam). The experience was once again absolutely OUTSTANDING.   Let me start by talking about the staff. Both Laurent and Nirosha have been on staff at this hotel for years (I believe 7 for Laurent and 14 for Nirosha). They are GEMS at this hotel. Laurent was a joy to see at breakfast every single morning, and you can see he genuinely cares about the guests and their experience.

The voucher dates were extended again and the communication was excellent regarding this. Our stay in early December was brilliant and the metro/bus stops are very close to the hotel which made travel around the city very easy! Although there is no bar facility, we were allowed to purchase a bottle of wine from the supermarket close to the hotel, and drink this in the communal area with friends that we had met at the hotel.

The free breakfast was more than adequate and had drinks in the evening time when we returned. Location was ideal and easy access to the metro line 2 which ties into all the major metro hubs so we never had to hop to many trains. Price of the hotel was more than acceptable and we plan to stay here again on our next visit to France.

I was really excited because I had read this hotel had a wonderful view on the Eiffel Tower and was very close to the centre. When I got there I was asked to pay straight away without even seeing the room, which in true fairness was ok to me considering I had booked with the option pay at the property. The room was clean but very small and what they call view of the tower is in reality a very small portion of the tower you can only if you really push your head out of the window.

The only reason we didn’t give a five star rating is due to the price of the breakfast (€24/person) which we thought was a bit greedy as was the price of drinks in the bar, but if the hotel chooses to charge this much, then there’s plenty of places locally where you can get breakfast for a fraction of the price. We just felt the hotel let themselves down charging these inflated prices to their guest, but as I say, there’s plenty more choice available only meters from the hotel The hotel is perfectly located to explore Paris... there’s even a Metro entrance 5 paces from the front door.

BAD We couldn't use the cooking facilities ""because of Covid"". I doubt that this is the law and was frustrating as there's no obvious notice on the website. I specifically choose properties so that I can prepare my own meals, so when the 'kitchen' cannot be used to make a meal, it's very annoying.

At the price we got it it was the best deal in Paris for us. Other places that were cheaper were in worse locations.  I like the location. It's not super central, but the average time to most destinations is around 15-25 minutes, which is great. It is also quite safe as far as we know, and we never got any bad vibes when walking from the metro at night (2 girls alone). I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel/area if I was traveling alone. In fact the area seems even safer than some central parts around/north of the louvre.

The bathroom was not much more than a cupboard size and had no windows for ventilation but my understanding is that this is to be expected in Paris as buildings are quite old and have been adapted to modern standards. The continental buffet breakfast was excellent. Special mention for the freshly baked pastries. We delighted in eating them every morning plus the fresh bread and cheese and meats. There was a transport strike during our time there so we walked a lot and found the hotel centrally located.

Dark and dingy corridors and the stairs are also a very dark brown.

The bed is pretty comfortable so no complaints there. Our shower drained dreadfully slowly and it looks as though there should be a door on it.  The hotel could really do with some updating. Dark and dingy corridors and the stairs are also a very dark brown.  Breakfast is very basic and I do think for 14€ it’s a bit of a rip off for some week old apples and a coffee, there are a few pastries as well but given the room that there is for dining I guess that’s all there’s room for.

353,"My wife and I enjoyed our 3 night stay. We found that it was very well centered in Paris, to include easy walking distance to the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, and at least two metro stations. There are very good restaurants and a patisserie within a couple of blocks.  The staff is excellent. They worked to find out what we needed with a pre-visit survey. The flowers I order were waiting for us when we arrived. We got there several hours early, but they worked to get us into our room very quickly at no extra charge. The continental breakfasts were very well presented, and they were available to present drinks to a guest visiting us to the hotel.

The most friendliest staff be it at the front desk or at the restaurant who were always willing to go that extra mile to make our stay there as comfortable as possible. They need to be applauded.

Car parking was easy as  adjacent to the Hotel is a basement parking from where one can directly get to the lobby. 15 minutes by car or 30 minutes by walk you are at some of the best restaurants in Paris.

Our room was small but that was fine as we were out most of the time.  Beds were very comfortable and always plenty of hot water for a bath or a shower over the bath.  Staff were helpful and welcoming.  Lady on reception was charming and unflustered even when busy.

I've stayed at 5-star hotels that treated me like crap - service is so important when you are staying somewhere away from home.  They are also dedicated to cleanliness which is important to me. They cleaned the room nearly every day that I was there and deep clean. They even cleaned my room one day when I woke up mid-afternoon after a night out.  The bathroom has been maintained well and it's obvious the hotel has good management. I think it could definitely be even better maybe even post-pandemic as travelers all return.
