The service provided by the staff both before and during our stay was fantastic and the apartment itself was fabulous as it was tastefully furnished and very spacious. The location was very central for exploring Barcelona and there are lots of nice restaurants close to the property.

5,"I am very surprised to read glowing reviews about Apartments SixtyFour- have I stayed at the same property as the other reviewers?! The only positive things about this property are its location, design and size (we stayed at 2-bedroom flat overlooking Passeig de Gracia). The negatives outweighed the positives for me:  - cleanliness can be improved, especially in Covid times. The floor was dirty and dusty, all our socks and feet became soiled after walking on the floor. And there were no cleaning products, other than just a simple mop. Handles and switches had dirty fingerprints on them, which is again unacceptable, and no wipes or sponges were provided to clean them. Bedlinen and towels  were very clean though.  - cleaning products were missing, there was not even a sponge to",None,"0     Apartments Sixtyfour

6,"Me, my wife and 3 year old son, just stayed six nights in 64 apartment hotel. Our apartment was a 2 bedroom in second floor patio view. Good things: Location is perfect in the middle of passeig de gracia, reception is respectful and helpful and check in is easy. Room is very big and clean. Kitchen is perfect. Air conditioning is very good. The most important thing about that hotel is the great hospitality, lady in reception is super helpful and kind. Bads: there is about 13 stairs at the entrance which you should carry luggages . The elevator is old fashion and very small. The room service is not optimal but due to Covid-19 situation is acceptable. I recommend this hotel to everyone.",None,"0     Apartments Sixtyfour

There were a lot of public spaces where you could sit, and the hotel has already been decorated for Christmas which looked quite nice.   COVID prevention procedures were being followed throughout the hotel. Staff were all wearing masks, we had to show our vaccination certificate at check in, and hand sanitiser was available around the hotel. On check in staff were friendly, but no one spoke to us much for the other days of our stay.

The spa and gym is nice. It is not big but functions well and the staff helped booking with Covid regulations.  We had a room on the 4th floor with plenty of natural light and automated black out curtains shades and shutters.  Fluffy towels which I always love.

The hotel staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay in Barcelona. The hotel is safe, clean and in a great location. The hotel is in a convenient area near shops, restaurants, bars, markets and transportation. It became easy to get around and locate destinations. I highly recommend hotel 1898 for your stay, you won’t be disappointed. Did I mention an indoor pool and spa, very clean and relaxing. Thank you Hotel 1898, you made our trip memorable and comfortable! We will be returning here for future trips and recommending this place to anyone visiting Barcelona.

Rooms are great, there’s a variety of options for breakfast and best of all is the rooftop terrace and bar area. We started off with a drink every night up there, views across the city are amazing!

The location is ideal, just a short walking distance to LaRambla and the Gothic quarter, however, in a somewhat more authentic area.

Getting to the room was slightly annoying also, going through different doors and elevators. But can look past that.  There was an option for breakfast, we did this one morning but didn't any other.

The hotel management is impeccable as they payed attention to every detail of our stay. Above and beyond every day we were there! Sandra was the perfect first human encounter each morning in the restaurant for breakfast. One of the friendliest people we’ve met! Barcelona is an amazing city with so many things to see and do, but on out last day of our trip, we just relaxed around the hotel. It’s extremely cozy, with the rooftop lounge and the library bar. The service is top notch and ended up being one of the best parts of the trip. When we come back to Barcelona we will only stay at the Serras!",None,"9    Serras Barcelona

The beautiful yet understated decor and different areas to lounge, enjoy time with each other and dine/have cocktails were simply marvelous - the view from the rooftop deck is hard to beat, along with the cozy seating arrangements both on the rooftop, and in the library.

The hotel was very clean and well equipped. The shower was great (but no door... keep that in mind) and there was a separated resting area for each room, unlocked with the room key. The staff was attentive, kind and very helpful. After two breakfast meals they remembered the kind of coffee we wanted and brought it to our table the next days without us asking. There is always free food and drinks at the lobby, and that's nice when you come back after a long day.

One awesome thing about this hotel is upon check in they gave us a WiFi hot spot device to use so as we explored Barcelona we were always in contact with our family.

We had a spacious ‘City’ room, which I prefer to the ‘Garden’ rooms. The beds are supremely comfortable, with exquisite linens. The 24 hour complimentary food means the hotel is very good value for money. We often skipped restaurant meals and ate at the hotel. Christina cooked my breakfast to perfection.

The room was lovely, bed SO very comfy and we had a lovely view of the top of Sagrida Familia  which was a bonus. Room equipped with fridge, hair dryer and (unlike previous poster commented on) hangers and kettle. No complaints at all.  We hadn’t planned on eating breakfast after reading reviews however so glad we did. Plenty of choice and very good value!   Rooftop terrace is gorgeous. Pool too cold for us but we enjoyed a few hours in the sunshine up there. Def need a bar and toilet up there but easy enough to head downstairs if needed.   Location was fine for us as we were happy to walk places. Always lots of taxis outside and only around €8-9 to La Ramblas.   Awesome hotel, we are already",None,"19    Hotel Barcelona 1882

It is certainly a stylish property at first appearance with a bright and almost opulent lobby. The problem is that everything else doesn’t share quite the same attention to detail.  The rooms are comfortable to the very minimum possible standard. Beds are nice and comfortable enough but there is very little else in the room. Apparently clothes hangers are a COVID risk so these have been removed as have kettles, irons and even safes. Apparently room service is available to the room however you have to have telepathic skills to know what is available as there are no menus to be found.

The bathroom was modern but that was it, bedroom and hallways are outdated and could do with a refresh. The room could do with being cleaner, the skirting boards are quite dirty and needed further attention. We didn’t spend a lot of time in the room, as we were exploring the city so it didn’t bother us too much. The standard room has twin beds, no option for a double bed or similar so if you are travelling with a partner it is worth keeping in mind.

The room is small and there is no swimming pool but the first-floor lobby and restaurant are spacious and the food is delicious.  The rooftop bar is good for a quick drink at night, I was worried if it would be too noisy and it is not! The staffs are very friendly.

Bed were bit shaky, you can feel if others in a same bed complex were moving.  Because of covid, breakfast was a take away. It was free when booked directly from their website.

The rooms and bed were comfortable, the roof-top patio was gorgeous and relaxing.  But the outstanding part of the stay is the service you receive from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave.  It has what I like to call “old world charm” – meaning that every employee we encountered made me feel welcomed, valued and went out of their way to make us comfortable. No other hotel I have ever stayed at made me feel so welcomed.  I never got the impression that any employee was looking for a tip – it was more like staying in someone’s home where they wanted you to relax, have a good time and fall in love with the City.

On arrival we had a lovely welcome card and bottle of cava on ice as a welcome surprise! Always a lovely touch to recognise my IHG status along with the very generous upgrade we got ! ;-)  From the people on the door, to the reception staff and rooftop bar team... everyone was so welcoming and friendly! Just like returning to an old friends house and being welcomed at every turn!   Was also great to see the cocktail hour in the ground floor bar as a new addition and we loved the pre-dinner cocktails that were mixed for us while watching the world pass by the windows!

360,There was a little confusion when we checked in as we booked the room with the outside terrace but was given a larger room on a high floor but without the terrace.  We popped back to Reception and was given the terrace room on the 4th floor.  Loved the terrace it was just a pity the weather wasn’t warm enough to sit outside though. The bed was extremely comfy.  Our room was cleaned daily and the cleaning staff were lovely. Breakfast is “Continental” and had plenty of choice.  It did get busy around 9.30 and the hotel had signs advising guests to try to avoid this time. I liked that everyone was provided with individual tongs to pick up their breakfast items - very clever idea. Really lovely roof top pool which would be super in better weather.

Rooms have a little more style than the average Ibis hotel, the bed is very comfortable and the bathroom worked well. I find it expensive for a 2* hotel at the weekends, there are better options in Barcelona. Also, they have parking at €14 for 24 hours which is reasonable, however from 20.00 on Saturday night until 08.00 on Monday morning, street parking is free.

401,"Pros:  Best hairdrier ever in a hotel. Bvulgari toiletries. Great breakfast roomservice.  Supernice check-in, smooth and easy accompanied by a glass of cava and a chocolate covered strawberry.  Cons: cleaning. Toilet in our room was full of stains that was easily washed off on walls and door. Cold at night, hard to adjust temperature.  Winebar closed. No sunbeds at the rooftop and pool is more for decorative puposes than to actually use.  Menu at rooftop should contain more food than just snacks. Difficult to find someone who actually works. But I understand staffing is cut short in these times and at this time of the year.   All in all a nice hotel, I’d come back any time just for the check-in but for cleanliness and value for money I’d probably stay somewhere else.",None,"40    Hotel Ohla Barcelona

The location of the hotel is fabulous, as you are walking distance to the Barcelona Cathedral and right next to the yellow line metro stop and a close walk to Plaza Catalunya and the green line. The rooftop bar is for sure worth a stop for the views (though drinks aren’t cheap)…the locals line up to head up so you know it’s a sight to see. The rooms are unique in the sense the shower is right smack dab in the middle of the room and the toilet is in a secret cubby in the wall, so you better be real friendly with who you go with.

TripMasters would not let us change our itinerary, they threatened to cancel our return flight to the US if we took a train to Barcelona on our own.

The hotel itself has pretty weird decor- signs of London and other cities, not much to honor the city of Barcelona and it's history. It was simply nothing special- pretty basic and outdated. The rooms were okay, but wifi was pretty bad and bathroom doors were like stalls (no privacy).   They didn't clean our rooms both days, and we had to get them to come clean them at around 4 or 5pm while we waited in the lobby. Finally- the coffee was really bad.

626,We have just returned from a 3 day visit in Barcelona and stayed in this hotel. I have to say it was slightly disappointing. The hotel itself is very clean and the staff are all very helpful and friendly but it could offer so much more. Our room was very small with only a double bed and hardly room to swing a cat. We were at the front of the hotel and it was very noisy most of the day and night. You could also hear a lot of noise from other guests as well. We were led to believe that there was a restaurant offering evening meals but this was not the case as they only do breakfast or lunch. There was no bar or anywhere to sit and relax. There is a roof terrace but apart from a few sun loungers there is nothing else there.  The location is good as it is near Sagrada Familia but,None,"62    Hotel Aranea

There was a balcony and the room although small was comfortable. Cleaning even though done daily, was not that efficient. There were many things on the room needing to be fixed or refurbished. Particularly the shower, which I had to call out reception to fix the issue. The AC worked fine as well as the TV. The bed was comfortable.

We booked rooms at the Hotel and prepaid the whole stay, with no cancelation rights. Then came the Corona crisis and the Race was postponed, the flights was not leaving and the whole trip was off.

We tasted some of their foods there and while a bit on the expensive side, what we had was really good  I was tempted to subtract one star, because one waitress on the top roof bar clearly had no joy in performing her work.

There was nobody there, only the single long ramp…  Inside the hotel the “welcome woman”, said and said me to back the taxi and advise de driver to park  the car in front of the hotel, instead to call someone to pick up our luggages.    Inside the room there was a complimentary Spanish Cava, warm, because the bucket - believe me - was empty. No ice, no even water.  The breakfast was a tragedy!  Personally, I don’t like breakfast “a la carte”. It works only to the enterprise. The guess can not choose very well the options.

Saturday night, rooftop bar full, and just 1 waiter on.  He didn’t stand a chance. Bankers bar and the garden inexplicably shut, while guests are unable to get a table on the rooftop bar as it’s full. I’d have been furious if that were me. Service at breakfast far too slow, on our final day of 3 we had to leave after 35 minutes- had been served eggs benedict with an undercooked egg and were still waiting on toast.

716,This is the first time we stayed in a Mandarin outside of Asia and it didn't disappoint even though you have to pay triple the rates you pay in Mandarins in Asia. Concierge was great as every place they recommended was excellent. The restaurants have very good food but expensive. Housekeeping was also amazing as hotel and room were spotless and I also asked for Aqua di Parma toiletries even though their basic toiletries were also very good and we were fully satisfied with our request. This is a point I always bring up as most 5 star hotels have this policy of having two classes of toiletries depending on the rate/room you get which is quite annoying when you are staying for a week and the basic rate of the hotel you are staying at is like 300 - 400 usd a night.

The hotel is well located and the rooms were a good size for a city centre hotel.  Service was lacking throughout my stay, there was limited space on the rooftop terrace with tables stating ‘reserved’ but unoccupied for 2.5 hours. I also think the photos of the ‘pool’ are misleading, in reality it is very much a dipping pool with the water coming up to your knees so impossible to swim in. On an evening there were inadequate team members on the terrace, it was the only bar of 3 bars in the hotel open on a Saturday night.

Room was clean, bed was comfy and the free bottled water was welcome.  Breakfast is not extensive but fresh  and enough to start the day on.

The staff were really great - giving good directions, showing us on a wall map and printing out metro stops and mini maps of the areas - many thanks to the young lady on reception for this. There was a problem with our door lock (these things happen), within an hour we’d been moved to a suite which we were grateful for. The roof terrace is lovely with a small plunge pool and sun beds - a bit cold in March for a swim but would think it was useful after a busy day in summer.

Only negative was that the window didn't open by design due to security reasons and the air con wasn't great and had a minimum temperature of 21 degrees so the room did get quite hot.

The cleaning staff is horrible they don’t clean the bathrooms or change the bedding daily and if you ask them to do it they get all offended and always have a smart answer. The bar was closed after 1pm and you can’t even get sugar or ice past that time or simply a glass. There were two rude employees at the front desk,Will and Mercedes. The others were nice. Not sure why a business owner would hire Will as the head of the front desk he has no manners or education and seems to come from the ghetto. The worst part probably was the service provided by the server at the bar, they had one only. The server came to substitute the FT employees that were on vacation.

The rooms are fairly small and quite basic but they are clean and the staff are friendly and the price is good for central Barcelona.

From extra tea bags in the evening to a personal recommendation on tapas bars - nothing was too much bother. The rooms were clean and well equipped , the safe use was free of charge. It was too cold to use the outside pool but it did look lovely and we did use the steam room ( could be a bit warmer !)

Our room overlooked La Rambla, which was cool. It was a little small, but it was fine.

You have direct metro line L9 (orange) from airport T1 to the last station Zona Universitaria and approximately 1 km walk to the hotel. Location is nice with the Cervantes Park close to the hotel. Walking distance to La Rambla is around one and half hour. Breakfast is tasty with the corner of Catalonian specialties. Rooms are clean and big enough. There are two nice restaurants for a lunch or dinner with friends. Sauna place need some renovation with an addition place to rest (lay down).",None,"93    Abba Sants Hotel

There are several coffee shops, bars and supermarkets in close vicinity, nice residential area. The hotel needs renovation, rooms are worn, furniture very dated with lot of scratches, some bulbs did not work. It is real shame, the staff is excellent, very helpful.

937,"My husband and I only stayed one night at the Abba Sants Hotel, but it was an enjoyable one. Previously, we had stayed at numerous Air B&B’s, and we both said the bed at Abba Sants was the best out of all of them. The location was close to a metro stop and convenient for where we needed to be. My only critique, would be when we first showed up. I had asked in the ‘special instructions’ on my reservation, to have a crib for our baby. The concierge said in Spanish to his colleague that I had not requested a crib. Even though there was a bit of miscommunication, they did end up putting a portable crib and all was well.

The hotel is a bit outdated but the sleeping quality is great which for me is the most important, The room is a decent size with spacy bathroom and clean. The view from my room was not wow, but who cares as I was using it only to a sleepover. The hotel staff is very pleasant. The breakfast is also good. The only minus point apart from ready to be refurbished is the hairdryer in the bathroom.

We took the train (a 2 minute walk) from the airport for a 20 minute ride to the Sants train station and an easy 4 minute walk to the hotel. The airline lost our luggage and the hotel was a short walk to a mall where we could stock up on clothes. The next morning we were able to easily walk across the street for an inexpensive breakfast and then onto the train station for our journey. The reception desk was efficient, helpful and friendly.

940,"We stayed over at Barcelona Century Hotel for 7 days and absolutely loved it. Firstly, the staff was incredibly polite and understanding. Always said hello and goodbye as soon as we showed up in the lobby, no matter how many timed we would walk through it throughout the day. We were met with an external issue one time that we had to inform the staff about and they reacted rapidly, which we appreciated very much.  Secondly, the room we were given was fine. While I can see why its size could've been a problem to some, it was spacious just enough for me and my family and it didn't bother us at all. The street view wasn't anything too spectacular, however we enjoyed it regardless.  Thirdly, the breakfast was fantastic! Delicious coffee - I especially recommend the cappuccinos.

942,"I stayed just one night. The room was old but refurbished. I particularly like the brand-new bathroom, with an excellent shower. It is BCN, so as one could expect the rooms are relatively small. Perhaps it is problematic to stay there if you are travelling with a big trolley. The room was quite (which I think is important in BCN), but some people were talking aloud at about 1:00am in the corridor. They wake me up (this is something I dislike about Spain: people speak super loud). Perhaps the worst part is breakfast. Mine was included in the room price (although they advertise it at 5 euros, as a special offer). They served me orange juice, two cold toasts with butter/jam, and some sort of processed bun/scone that I gently refused. That's it.

The Hotel is in a side street in the Eixample area of central Barcelona.  I would describe the neighbourhood as mixed, with a range of restaurants, cafes, bars and attractions.  the locality is definitely not high end, nor is it shabby. You're about 15 minutes walk from the  Placa Catalunya, at the end of Las Ramblas.  The hotel's public areas are modern and clean.  The staff are friendly and helpful, and were able to help us with a very good restaurant recommendation for  lunch nearby.

I had a looooong flight to Barcelona and his very warm greeting and smiles helped me allay my fears for booking this hotel for 10 nights since it was my first time trying this hotel out. I requested from him to put me in a quiet room and he assured me it will be alright. I was very, very glad and felt more relaxed.

I was reorganizing my belongings after just getting in from a flight outside my room (because of the quiet hours) leaving ample room in the walkway to get around.  I was about as far into the corner as possible out of the way. I was approached by the staff in a very aggressive matter (without a mask within 6 feet of me) that this was unacceptable because of Covid-19. I tried to explain what I was doing with my belongings and he was incredibly rude and condescending that because of Covid I couldn't be in the hallway doing what I was doing.
