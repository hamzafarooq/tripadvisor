"As the title says, old but beautiful area. Rooms are spacious for 2 double beds in waikiki. I just can’t understand why and how it takes so long to checkin. Everytime we come here, 45-60 minutes to checkin. This time we missed dinner reservation even though we arrived an hour and 15 minutes before thinking we’d have time as the dinner is in Waikiki too! Diamond line ends up taking longer than the regular line! Have Diamond, safe travels ready and safe travels not ready lines and actually, have a Diamond/LOCAL line ;) Speaking of Diamond, was given nothing. If we do get something here, I was not told about it nor received it. I can’t justify anyone paying these amounts along with resort fees and $60 a night to park for what you get when staying here.",December 2021
"We stayed one night in the rainbow tower full ocean view and 6 nights in the grand Waikikian. The rainbow tower had an amazing  view and it was just breath taking. We then moved to a time share room on the 27th floor with partial ocean view. The view was more city view but the room itself was high , spacious and well kept. The appliances in the 2 bedroom suite  was modern and having a kitchen was very beneficial for us having breakfast before we leave for the day. The staff at the village was very  courteous and friendly and we never had a problem.  The lagoon was perfect for the kids and for novice scuba divers who are afraid of sharks in the real ocean (Like me) the lagoon gets crowed during the day  so we usually go early. The beach was a little rough with a lot of rocks   It",August 2021
"The staff was friendly and helpful .  Our Needs  were attended to in a timely fashion. The environment was safe and clean, and we felt comfortable as all protocols were enforced, especially while navigating through  Covid; convenient location too!",December 2021
"Madhouse over Christmas. Staff at Alii tower Conceirage were amazing. Everything else about the resort is mediocre to poor. Pigeons are a menance, they are everywhere, even on the beach and inside the checkIn area. Don’t consider them exotic, more like pests. And Covid what? Hand sanitizer not filled, elevators are packed, mask mandate no one bothers.",December 2021
"I’ve been to Hawaii 18 times since 2017 and stayed at this resort about 13 times including this visit but not the visit two months ago.  It’s traditional and meant for family and I was just here 2 years ago but everything has changed in two years. The property seemed ran down. I’m a diamond member and staying here for two weeks is normal but this time it didn’t feel like home. The rooms are so outdated. The service is so minimal. There is no aloha spirit anymore and I’m thinking COVID has changed everything here.  Tapa bar not open during the day. No pool waiters running drinks and lunches anymore. Empty retail spaces , no PlayStation games rentals anymore,no music playing by the pool even though the spaces are outfitted with speakers and used to play music, no penguins, no",December 2021
"Resort was decent, rooms were clean, but otherwise it felt like they were nickel and dining guests. Charges for beach umbrellas and chairs were exorbitant and food was excessively overpriced, even for a hotel/resort. Surprisingly, drink pricing was actually in-line with my expectations (expensive but not excessive).  Ultimately, I didn’t have a bad time, but I don’t think I’ll return - it just didn’t leave me with a great feeling.",December 2021
"Ok hotel, not great. It took us 30 minutes to check in even though we are Hilton gold members. They charge you $50 resort fee, which is extremely expensive and when you go to the beach for example they want to charge you $60 for a chair and umbrella, this is ridiculous and greedy. Beware of parking as well they charge you $50 per day, and that is self parking, valet should be more expensive.  Pools and beaches were very crowded, with covid they should have some restrictions on quantity of people in the hotel. They seem to run at full capacity. Not covid friendly.  I think there should be better options for your money.",December 2021
"Had to same and my family rooms twice since first room had bugs 2nd room AC didn’t work. Beds were small and uncomfortable, rooms outdated and dusty. Elevators some out of order and almost 2hr to check in.",December 2021
"Being a diamond plus member I was provided a corner room upgrade in Rainbow tower the true Ocean Front experience with 2 balconies and view of the lagoon, sunset, Diamond Head. Could not have asked for more. Whole family had a blast during the 14 night stay.",December 2021
"This was our second time staying at this resort.  We chose this place because we wanted a kid friendly hotel with direct access to the beach, several pools, waterslides, and lots of restaurants… this place checked off all those boxes. This resort is massive with multiple towers. Our room in the Diamond Head Tower was clean with a good view from the balcony. Nothing fancy, but we didn’t expect that. Everything at the resort was within a short walk from our tower.  Although the pools were “heated,” the water was still chilly and our kids were often shivering. Unfortunately, only one pool had hot tubs. The beach was great for kids, with small waves and soft sand. The lagoon was also a fun place for them to splash around.  We ate at several restaurants at the resort and all of our",December 2021
"I’ll not ever go back, the cost for Canadians is not equal to the experience. The taxes upon taxes was horrendous. Not friendly just a zoo. People were everywhere without masks and one bathroom for each pool area",December 2021
The stay there was perfect. Lots of fun things to do and our room was perfect. Had a perfect view of the resort and the beach. They helped me plan and book 3 of my activity tours and gave the best rates.,December 2021
Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 6 nights in Oct. 2021. Every thing was great. Had no issues at all. The only problem was we had to leave. Check-in was easy and no issues. The room was great. It was clean and up to date. Room has a fridge which came in handy. House cleaning was said to be on demand but our room was cleaned daily. Pool area was crowded but was able to enjoy it. Beach was great. You can rent chairs and umbrellas. The prices are a little high but that's vacation prices. In actuality you never have to leave the property if you don't want to. There are many dining options on the property. Tips. If you are a Costco member book the trip with them. You save money and the Resort fees are waved.,October 2021
We really like the stay here. I especially our room getting upgraded. This is actually my first time to get upgraded room as a dimond member few years. The upgraded room is very modern and has a very broad ocean view from an elevated position.,December 2021
"Village was great and unique. Lots to do just being inside the hotel village. A map of the area can be better because it was hard to locate via map and just easier to walk around and find what you need. Quick as access to beach. Beach was 6/10 compared to other locations. For a luxury hotel, complimentary amenity can be better but hotel rooms were great and ocean view was amazing.",December 2021
"I feel like this is a resort all families should experience at least once in Waikiki. The views from the oceanfront rooms in the Rainbow Tower are crazy good. The lagoon was fun to ride the water trikes on, and kids had a blast in the calm waters with rock walls breaking the surf in front of the hotel. The pool area is also awesome for the kids with multiple pools to choose from.  Used their umbrella service and it was so worth it to keep out of the sun. I will never go to the beach again without shade!  There were several restaurants and places to get treats on site so it was super convienent with the kids. There was also a ABC store on site for essentials as well. It was a bit far from other food options to walk to in Waikiki. Parking was also very expensive at $50+ a night.",March 2021
"Unless you want to spend 3+ hours a day waiting for the elevator, this Hilton is not a good choice for a vacation stay. I paid extra for an upgrade to the rainbow tower for a premium experience, yet my experience so far was the opposite. Staff did nothing to make up for the elevator issues they have since we arrived. I will upload pictures and videos of the long lines soon.",December 2021
We stay at Hilton Hotels nearly exclusively  in the continental US and are also Hilton Garden Vacation Club members. We expected the same level of rooms and decor and were sorely disappointed. This hotel needs MAJOR updating. The furniture was beat and the worn carpeting was worse. We had a spectacular view which is the only reason for the generous 3 star rating. Where are the Hilton execs?  Why are you wasting this perfectly beautiful view on these terrible rooms that the furnishings look like they are right out of 1990 at best? There essentially is NO lobby; it's a dark and drab area with some individual stations. It's even hard to tell it is the lobby!  NO restaurants in the hotel and while we were there it rained and rained and rained so every meal we had to trek out into,December 2021
A perfect location to the beach. Lots of restaurants and shopping. Our family of 5 slept comfortably in our room but it would have been nice to have two bathrooms and a separate sleeping area for a bit more privacy.,December 2021
Having traveled extensively with Hilton (Diamond Level) I am disappointed.  Now I realize this is COVID times but the staffing shortage is effecting this resort.  The front desk check-in/check-out process is PAINFUL…  read that GLACIAL… The wait time can be 20-30 mins.    Housekeeping is very friendly but when one has to ask two out six nights for a top sheet for their bed it gets ridiculous.    Having stayed at the Westin Moana previously I was spoiled when I learned they do not have dedicated room for late flyers.  At The Westin you can reserve (complementary) a day room for an hour to shower and change for a late evening flight.  When I asked if this was provided I learned I could get a room for over $200 to change. On top of this they’d throw in an airport voucher.  Talk,December 2021
