Everytime we come here, 45-60 minutes to checkin. This time we missed dinner reservation even though we arrived an hour and 15 minutes before thinking we’d have time as the dinner is in Waikiki too! Diamond line ends up taking longer than the regular line! Have Diamond, safe travels ready and safe travels not ready lines and actually, have a Diamond/LOCAL line ;) Speaking of Diamond, was given nothing. If we do get something here, I was not told about it nor received it. I can’t justify anyone paying these amounts along with resort fees and $60 a night to park for what you get when staying here.\n",

We then moved to a time share room on the 27th floor with partial ocean view. The view was more city view but the room itself was high , spacious and well kept. The appliances in the 2 bedroom suite  was modern and having a kitchen was very beneficial for us having breakfast before we leave for the day. The staff at the village was very  courteous and friendly and we never had a problem.  The lagoon was perfect for the kids and for novice scuba divers who are afraid of sharks in the real ocean (Like me) the lagoon gets crowed during the day  so we usually go early.

      "  review_body : I’ve been to Hawaii 18 times since 2017 and stayed at this resort about 13 times including this visit but not the visit two months ago.  It’s traditional and meant for family and I was just here 2 years ago but everything has changed in two years. The property seemed ran down. I’m a diamond member and staying here for two weeks is normal but this time it didn’t feel like home. The rooms are so outdated. The service is so minimal. There is no aloha spirit anymore and I’m thinking COVID has changed everything here.  Tapa bar not open during the day. No pool waiters running drinks and lunches anymore.

Beware of parking as well they charge you $50 per day, and that is self parking, valet should be more expensive.  Pools and beaches were very crowded, with covid they should have some restrictions on quantity of people in the hotel. They seem to run at full capacity. Not covid friendly.

The pool area is also awesome for the kids with multiple pools to choose from.  Used their umbrella service and it was so worth it to keep out of the sun. I will never go to the beach again without shade!  There were several restaurants and places to get treats on site so it was super convienent with the kids.
