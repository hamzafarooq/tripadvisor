We spent a week in the lodge.   The room was a decent size, and had lots of storage space. Having a fridge was great. We did go shopping before getting to the park, so we did breakfast and lunch on our own. We found the beds comfortable.   It's not a 5 star hotel, but it doesn't pretend to be. If you want that, pay for the Ahwanee. The room had a rustic feel, which seemed appropriate for the location. And speaking of location, it doesn't get any better!

Lights have 40 W bulbs( too dim to read with when more than a foot away), half the bathroom has no ceiling, yellowing wall paint, etc. etc. A national embarrassment run by/for the  national park service. Disgraceful ripoff by the park service.  The restaurant/food hall looks make shift and badly in need of a refresh - worn carpets, tired cafeteria tables, shabby rest rooms,  etc  and serving what looks and tastes like prison food.   AVOID."

The staff did go out of their way to give us a room with a waterfall view, which was awesome. I guess my complaint is that the property is run down. Needs updating. As for the views, go see the sequoia trees.  It’s a hike yes, but worth it. Eateries are a plus. Not bad for the cost."

That's the good thing.  No need to drive anywhere.  However, the rooms are showing signs of wear.  Food options are limited in locations and hours inside the park due to Covid, but we knew that going in.  Staff does not enter your room for any cleaning, you can request anything and it is delivered.  Wifi is little to zero....even in the main lobby.  Staff at front desk very accommodating and helpful.  Would I stay here again?  Probably not.  I'd try for the Ahwahnee."

We spent 4 days walking, hiking and biking, all just by going outside of the lodge.  The lodge is a series of motel-style, two story buildings surrounded by nature and beautiful Yosemite.  Some restaurants and services are temporarily closed by Covid restrictions, but nature is wide open!"

One downside in August was lack of AC.  We had probably the worst 1st floor room near outside  tanks, so there was little air flow -- the night was extremely hot."

We saw all kinds of animals day and night, enjoying everything they had to offer!

I'll make it simple:  PROS: Location, location, location. Hot shower, fridge, restaurants and store on premises, we never got in our car the whole week, close to the Merced River, took night walks and felt totally safe, bike rental on premises, lots of hikes nearby, beautiful wood decor, no bugs even with door left open, lots of bats swishing by balcony  CONS: Expensive, lots of people, thin walls, grumpy staff at hotel/bike rental/eatery/etc, ripped bedding, rough cheap sheets/covers, lots of people on their phones, late check in (5pm) and early check out (10am)  We are not sure if we would come back or not.

We had an upstairs room in a building near the dining hall - which I was happy about because I prefer to be upstairs whenever possible. The room was clean, I checked every corner of the mattress, bedding and every other upholstered surface in the room and I didn't find anything concerning. There isn't an air conditioner but there were two box fans in the closet, so we propped them up infront of the balcony door on a luggage rack to draw some of the cool/fresh air into the room. There was also a ceiling fan which we turned on when we arrived, so between the 3 fans the room temperature was fairly comfortable that night. Unfortunately, due to COVID, the hotel's main restaurant was closed so the only option for"

I agree with the other reviews to bring your own food.  The Base camp dining is way overpriced for the quality of food you get, and the general store is also pretty expensive. Some rooms upstairs have skylights that have amazing views of the mountains.  Be warned, there is no air conditioning!   So the upstairs rooms can get pretty hot by late afternoon."

The bar had 3 people working which is one more than the cafeteria style cooks working. We waited over an hour for a hamburger and Hot Dog that was worse than school cafeteria food. It also cost more than the 2 drinks from the bar. Everything else is closed  be prepared. I would suggest bringing your own food.

We found our room clean and comfortable. The wifi worked well, although they charge ten dollars for twenty four hours. The restaurant was open on our first night, and dinner was very good. We looked forward to dinner on the second night, only to learn the restaurant was closed due to lack of staff. Pizza was our only option, unless we wanted to drive to the valley, which we didn't wish to do. Breakfast was served buffet style and although a little pricey for buffet, very good. Very conveniently located for entry to the park."

The lodge does its job but not much more.    Some things to keep in mind:   Is it worth $300 for a two bed room for a night? As a hotel on its own absolutely not and you’d likely feel ripped off.  You’re paying for the privilege to stay in the valley.  If it means that much to you, (and it might!)  then this hotel is ok and these cons might not be so bad:  1. You can feel the springs in the bed 2. Pretty much no wi-fi available in the rooms- but might reach yours if you’re in the right place. 3. No air conditioning (there is a lot they provide to mitigate this - use your fans wisely and open the middle of your front door and open the back door to create a"

Spent a night there only to find out it was over 100F in the room and there was no AC. The room felt like a steaming cage, had to keep the door open to help air circulate as guest next to my room did the same, but it barely helped. Literally it was in uninhabitable condition, everything was hot, turned on all the fans, the wind felt hot, even the mattress was hot. Lying on the bed, just felt like you were being cooked, slow cooked alive. Finally fell asleep at 3am, the worst hotel night ever, which cost me $300!! If you wanted to verify whether I'm telling the truth, try it."

It is located in the heart of the valley very closely located to the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center and Yosemite Falls via walking. It also has a food court (which was busy nightly [1 night we went about ½ hour before closing and we zipped through the ling]), a souvenir/snack shop, a pizza place (it was pretty good and affordable and they had these pre-order pizza plans at the front desk which was really helpfu), and a Starbucks (closed twice a week which was a bummer).

The location is ideal for exploring the spectacular park. Rooms have a private balcony (or patio) perfect for morning coffee and night stargazing. The rooms are rustic & should be in a Nat’l Park. They’re tastefully decorated in western decor & also have “creature-comforts” - like a coffee pot, extra fan or heater for winter, spacious rooms & bathrooms (you know after you’ve stayed in other parks!) and even a TV although we rarely used it. The Base Camp dining room is close to all buildings with lots of tasty choices at good prices.

We found the room to be plenty big enough and comfortable, even for 5 of us. It was clean, yet a little outdated with an intermittent overhead light and a non working coffee maker. But once again, location made up for it. We were o lay steps away from the Valley Loop Trail, a few hundred yards from the beach/river, and a short walk to Yosemite Falls. Room had a nice outdoor patio area. A/C wasn’t an issue with us as the weather wasn’t extremely hot, but I could see where it could be.  Would definitely stay again…"

We visited over the July 4th weekend had a room on the 2nd floor and although the valley cools off at night (down to near 60-65 F), it can get quite hot on a summer day even without a heatwave in the forecast (low 90s F). The lack of A/C on even a typical summer day really heats up the rooms to the point its near 90 F during the evening and takes a while to cool off to even 80 F. They do provide a lot of fans but with the high temperatures it's still difficult. I found it hard to sleep early in the nights with the high temperatures. The one night I had a good sleep was when we had a cloudy afternoon. I can't even imagine what visiting during a heatwave maybe like.  Other than that the"

It is the 3rd building from the lodge and consists of external stairs leading to the rooms. The bathroom was remodeled and looks great. Walled toiletries were available as well as a mini fridge, coffee maker, and a couple of portable fans (No A/C). The walled fan unit in the corner of the room only blew out warm air and the windows on the balcony door wouldn't open so the room was pretty hot in mid june as the temperature was between high 80's to mid 90's.

On the third floor, our patio looking over the river was wonderful for morning coffee with the babbling river noise so soothing. There were also outdoor hot tubs available, though we didn’t take advantage. The elevator is a bit scary, the furnishings sparse and the mattress was a bit hard for me, but happy to overlook those items based on the other benefits. I’ve paid more for worse!

Their website calls it a “luxury resort” but I would call it average. The room was nice with views of the mountains and river on each side, with an OK balcony for morning coffee or evening cocktails. Food choices are very limited at the River Restaurant and below average in quality in my opinion. It’s proximity to Yosemite is a plus (about 4 miles from the Arch Entrance on the west side of the park). There is a gas station/grocery store about a mile west of the Lodge which is also convenient."

The room was adequate, but that was about all. Missing a light bulb in the ceiling fan, there were no light bulbs in the stairwell, which was dangerous after dark. The grounds were shoddily maintained, many of the decorative outdoor light fixtures were missing light bulbs. The outdoor pool was nice, but no towels. I realize that they are only 10 miles from the West entrance to Yosemite and that is how they can charge $250+ per night, but please put some of that back into general maintenance and safety."

Room 2085 has an incredibly noisy air conditioner in the bedroom facing the river. There is no way to sleep in that room as the air conditioner goes boom and shakes the window when it cycles on and off. Even our neighbors said they heard it.  This room is part of a suite that cost us over $500 a night. We gave feedback to the manager and heard nothing in return.  Beware of that suite if you want to sleep at night.

We weren’t that crazy about the dinner options but other restaurants were too far away. There is a cute gift shop in the lobby and we had access to 2 pools. It was very hot so make sure to purchase water for hiking. We spent 2 nights and it wasn’t enough time to see everything. This is the best accommodation outside of the park. Also WiFi is extra.

False advertising, dirty and dated. This hotel complex has at least five buildings,  and two (Maple and Juniper)  that face the road.  But I did not realize that in April when I booked for a July stay. When I arrived, I found that my choice of the less expensive “mountain view” room put me 30 feet from the highway on one side, and on the other, sliding doors with no screen led to the building’s HVAC system. Please see my photo of the hotel description of the room. The room was dark, with holes in some of the walls and fixtures. I took some photos.

Another downsize is there is nothing close  by to eat but the on-site restaurant which is pretty pricey. 19 dollars for hamburger and ffs which I split with my husband and that will cost you another 7 bucks!

I could not recommend it more.  The lodge itself is situated beautifully right off highway 120 and the grounds are well designed.  The room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  We loved sitting on the balcony and gazing at the trees.  It could not have been more family friendly.  There is an amazingly well stocked game room, zip lines and tall slide, family hot tub and nightly s’mores.  All the kids had a blast.  My only complaint is that the food service was quite slow at the restaurant, but we just had the kids play in the game room while we waited.  We had he best weekend and will definitely be back!"

The game room in the lodge is a TON of fun.    The only, only, only downside I saw to Rush Creek is that their staff seems to be a little indifferent to the guests and not terribly friendly.

Located close to one of Yosemite's entrances, its location makes visiting Yosemite very easy.  Additionally, it is a newer construction than most area hotels.  It offers things like many outlets, games and books, and no TVs in sleeping rooms, that are aligned with the patterns of modern travelers.  We enjoyed the meals offered at the restaurant, including menu items that were easily modified into vegan meals.  The community lounge and tavern are excellent places to hang out and relax.  Customer service was a little uneven, but not enough to complain.  The one rude waitress who neglected our table, allowing our water glasses to remain empty for way too long, was offset by 10 other staff who were cheerful, friendly and helpful."

It was dingy, dirty, and just kinda seedy.  They clearly do not put any of the extremely high rates they charge back into the rooms.  The a/c units were old and very loud and nothing really seemed clean.  Before you assume I'm a snob when it comes to hotels - I really am not.  I've stayed in multiple National Parks where the facilities were lacking and I don't expect a 5 star stay everywhere I go.  But my bare minimums of cleanliness were not met at all.

Nothing's changed, which is fine.  It's one of the 2 hotel choices in El Portal, owned by the same people, and it's a bit cheaper than the other one.    They're only allowed to fill half the rooms during this Covid time.  The restaurant does take out only, and it's a bit limited but okay (I won't review the restaurant given the current limitations).  The pool was operating normally.  Room was okay, nothing spectacular but it met our needs.  Clean, just dated.  And the A/C unit was very noisy.  Oh well...

If you're looking for a spot to sleep near the southern entrance/exit of Yosemite, this motel is one of only a few places within a reasonable distance. You are otherwise HOURS from other accommodations especially if you're considering staying in the valley.

The cabin itself is decent and very good size. All was going well until I saw a rat trap near the fireplace. No phone or internet service to speak to front desk about it and we had a full itinerary for the first day so we were busy. Then the next night we saw the critter and my wife screamed. We decided to just go about the rest of our trip and call when we had service later about the issue. We called and they didn’t want to do anything about it. So sad. I wouldn’t recommend this place again. Plus it’s was not cheap. 350 a night! For a rat infested night of sleep. No thank you!

So when we arrived (after a long day), we've had to turn around and drive 2 miles to the main lodge, and again 2 miles to our room. The keys didn't work, so again: 2 miles to Cedar Lodge, 2 miles back. Not funny with tired kids. And the staff didn't seem to care. Well - finally we were able to get into the room. And we were suprised: It was beautiful, clean, comfortable. Even the towles were fold into animals (as you know it from cruises).   Having no wifi made things a littlebit complicated, you can't even purchase it (at Cedar Lodge, its 10 Dollars/12 hours).  When you know, that you won't have any service and that you have to carry you baggage up the many stairs, you'll be fine there.   The kitchenette"

There was NOT wifi is understandable. But no customer service and no phone. If it was $60 / room, I understand. But it was over $150. If in case of emergency, you have to drive up to next hotel where is almost 3 miles away. And it located by the road and you feel the trucks vibration too. Not quiet at all. If the owner see this memo, please cease your business."

There are some confusing aspects of their layout and one thing that I would have like to have changed but overall it's really great.  Before going understand they have three locations on the same road and you have to check in at the main one. So, be sure to go to the one with the lobby and store (there is also a restaurant on the property).   We stayed down the road in their A-Framed building and it was too wonderful. The river right out of front window was breathtaking. The only downside is that we stayed in January and the hotel did not turn the heater on before we arrived so it took a long time for the room to warm up."

As long as you actually research what you book, there are no surprises that it is located 2 miles from the main hotels lobby and restaurant areas. To be honest, its in a great spot. Probably the closest you can get to Yosemite without paying more than $250 a night in October.  It is only 10 miles from a park entrance station and you can utilise all facilities at the Cedar Lodge if required. There is no wi-fi, BUT, the main hotel itself only offers pay wi-fi which they freely admit is terrible anyway. If you are in Yosemite, who cares if you aren`t connected for a few days.

Unfortunately for us, we did have an emergency. Things were ok, but I dread to think what would have happened if it had been life threatening.

We were able to upgrade but pay the full price to a cabin as one was free, for what we paid we had a lot better than the cabin elswhere with closer drive to yosemite valley. Found it overpriced for what it was.  The cabin had hard mattresses but amenities were good and staff helped when needed."

The room was clean and surprisingly spacious and we as a family appreciated the microwave and fridge.  There is a good little market just down the block (Mono Market) which sells everything including a surprisingly wide array of Indian Food Microwave pouch meals. There is the Epic Cafe on the grounds which we didn't have a chance to eat at. The view of the lake is mostly from the balcony versus the room.  The grounds are very nicely landscaped with some Zen places to relax. The wireless connection worked well for us. Given that it's just off 395, the road noise was not a problem though we slept with the windows closed and fan/ac running. No noises other than the white noise we wanted from the unit."

Numerous calls when unanswered except for a recorded message to the effect that no one was available to take the call and to try again later (no option to leave a message). When I finally reached someone (again, 5 days prior to our check in date), I was told curtly that they don't accept reservations.

Pros: Large rooms Nice staff Cons: Just about everything else.  Some elecrical outlets are so loose anything you plug in falls out.  Toilet area of bathroom has two light switches - one a heat lamp for the shower and one a light for the room.  Both also turn on fans that are so loud they could wake up someone in the next room.  One of the switches needed to be jiggled to get it to work.  There were two sinks and both aerators were defective such that water squirted out in all directions in sharp streams insuring that water splashed all over.  Mattress overly soft.  Hard to straighten my back up after the first night.  Maid service only until noon.  This is usually not a problem since most people are out before then."

We managed to sneak in a couple hours at the restaurant before it closed—amazing staff, delicious food (try the spicy pasta!).

A lampshade was damaged, there were no towel racks in the bathroom, the hottub was almost to hot to sit in and the tv channels were confusing to find. When we came back to our room the day after we arrived it hadn't been made up. I contacted the front desk and the owner personally came in and cleaned it which impressed us.

This cabin, located directly behind the motel with it's own entrance and small porch, needs some maintenance.  First off, parking was difficult as the snow was not adequately removed like it was in the lower lot. After returning to our cabin in the afternoon we noticed an inch of water on the floor of the kitchen eating area and water dripping from the ceiling. The front desk gentleman came up with some ice buckets and towels and said there wasn't anything he could really do about it.

In the bathroom I found towels that look like they have been used far too many times to the point of disarray, dead mosquitos and other small insects on the ceiling, rust along the vent, filth all around the window, and a mirror with small cracks on the rim. In the “kitchen,” the floor and inside of the drawers/cupboards were stained and the discolored walls had peeling paint. The heater ventilated smelly air and AC was nonexistent, else it was difficult to locate/operate. Overall, it was a nightmare and could make do with a total makeover."

From arrival it turned out the place was full of mosquitoes, 3-4 hours later we managed to kill them all.  The issue was the lack of maintenance as follows: Broken clock, stains on carpets, blood on pillows, primed doors and nails not filled or painted, drip pans wrapped in foil. Bathroom very old with vanity assembled in pieces etc.   The owner needs to spend some money instead of behaving like it’s a cash cow. The location is good but the place is seriously lacking maintenance."

It was a typical Mid-Century Motel. It was close to June Mountain Ski Resort and comfortable.   As many others had reviewed before, this Motel seemed a little tired and is in need of a refresher.  Other then that for the price and location it was perfect especially over a holiday weekend and was a last minute choice. I would stay at Whispering Pines Motel again."

I'm not sure I understand the negative reviews. June Lake is a small mountain town and if you're expecting ""luxury"" you may be disappointed by most of what June has to offer, but you could go pay $600 a night for that in Mammoth. For those us who like the small town, family owned and operated mountain vibe, this place is perfect. We arrived on a very snowy Saturday and found the staff hard at work plowing the lot so guests could park. We passed by a lot of other properties on the way to Whispering Pines who did not plow for their guests so I was immediately pleased by that small detail. The gentleman at the check in counter was polite and friendly and quick getting us checked in. The lobby/check in"

It is located about a 20-minute drive from Lee Vining and Mono Lake, and about 40 minutes from the east entrance to Yosemite Park (but a 2.5 hour drive to Yosemite Valley  even if you enter at a time when there is no wait to get into the east entrance--longer if there is a wait there).  Our room was fairly spacious, with two queen beds, and also had a small but full kitchen (about 10 foot square) with full-sized fridge, Keurig coffee maker, table and chairs, and basic dishes and utensils included.  The hot tub is nice to have, but it would be great if the windows to the room that encloses it were cleaned so one could enjoy the outdoor view"

The rooms are a bit tired but the shower facilities were excellent. We had a disturbed nights sleep due to excessive noise from the room above which can always occur in two storey motels. The jacuzzi and sauna were excellent and there is also a nice garden with comfortable chairs to enjoy the view. It is a short drive from June Lake village whilst there is a restaurant across the road.

If your a fisherman its only a few miles in either direction to June lake, Sliver Lake and Grant lake. There is a small kitchen area with a small but full size refrigerator, microwave, some cups, dishes and silverware, toaster and kitchen table. There is a dry sauna if your into that and a 6 person Jacuzzi. The June Lake General store is only a few minutes away if you forgot anything from home. CONS: The room is old and out of date. The shower knob was old very difficult to get the water temperature to a comfortable temperature, paper thin walls and upstairs flooring, kitchen linoleum was peeling in places, While is was nice to have a microwave it was an older model"

Bugs (centipedes coming out of the drain, roach looking critters and some I have never seen), dirty, broken blinds, warped floorboards, mold in the bathroom, water damage, florescent lights, and not stocked with essentials. The layout was awkward and the shower was almost impossible to use. This tiny abode needs major updates in order to ask for $250 a night. The location and parking were fine. The views were just ok."

The resort part probably comes from the presence of a whirlpool but apart from that it's just a typical motel. The view from our room was quite astonishing but all the rest was very much adequate. Ok beds, ok bathroom and there was a kitchen of sorts where we had our own breakfast (it isn't included). It's a small drive outside of June Lake Village which is a shame because in the town centre are most of the restaurants. We had an ok stay there, nothing special but not bad. Sorry for the ""shrugs shoulders""-approach but sometimes it's just what it is: ok."

The location is right in the middle of June Lake City, putting it within walking distance of the lake, marina and restaurants.  They have BBQ’s and a fish cleaning station.   The rooms have kitchens or kitchenettes.    If your looking for a 5 Star hotel, this isn’t the place but it’s hard to beat for the great staff, location, convenience and price.   They earned their 5 Stars from me, I’ll be back."

Many people come to fish.  I hike and the High Sierra is 30 minutes away around Tioga Pass, both inside and outside the national park.  My room was spacious and the kitchen great - 4 burner gas range (no oven), fridge, microwave, coffee maker stocked daily, good cookware.  No AC, but a nice cool evening breeze with open windows.  Can be a bit noisy with the windows open, street noise, cars in the lot, or big groups hanging out around the bbq grills for dinner.  All manageable but I have some concern about the neighborhood skateboard ramp being built immediately underneath the windows in the back.  If that turns out to be popular in the evenings it could be unpleasant.  Absent that, a very nice stay with very helpful"

There was a nice area in front of our room so we could sit outside. It was conveniently located next to the market and brewery, and within walking distance of a number of restaurants. We had originally intended on using June Lake as a base for hiking in Yosemite, but ended up staying in the area instead. Bodie, Mono Lake (tufas) and Mammoth are all very worthwhile places to visit while in the area."

We ate supper in the bar area so we could see the football game. They had lots of wait staff and service was attentive. Best chickens wings anywhere.

It has a modern lodge design, mostly in stone, with beautiful furnishings. The public areas were more exceptional than the rooms, but it was very comfortable.

Beautiful lodge with nice accommodations. Nice big fireplace in main lobby. They had piano player one evening. Nice dining experience. Hot tub and pool. It was about a 40-50 minute drive to Yosemite Valley- windy roads all the way there. Would come back again.

Almost every staff member I interacted with was rude and management seemed to not care.  Everything from the front desk to the gift store to the restaurant was awful but the restaurant was by far the worst. I stopped by the bar for a drink and the bartender (antony) pretended I wasn't there and continued to flirt with the 2 girls sitting having lunch.  I asked him for a beer and he told me it's rude to interrupt and he will be with me once he is done. I waited because there were no other options and then I hear him tell the girls ""some people are just born stupid I'll be right back. He then came to me and said ""what do you want, it better be quick because I'm busy helping other guests that were here"

I originally booked the upstairs cottage room but was convinced to upgrade to the Explorer Cabin.   Granted, it was rainy and as they don't have bell porters, we would have struggled moving our bags and baby gear ourselves.   The Explorer Cabin itself was fine but definitely requires the use of a car between the main lodge and cabins with our toddler.   The reason for my low score is that upon entering, there was someone's used Starbucks coffee cup sitting on the bench. At first I thought maybe they used Starbucks branded pods but I took a look inside and saw leftover coffee.   Secondly, after putting our child to sleep, I went to put on a robe only to put my left hand into the pocket with a used tissue. SO GROSS. Needless to say, we"

Granted, this was added last minute as a result of Sequoia NP being closed. Close to park, yes, but still a good 45 minute drive into Yosemite NP for most valley activities. Staff all very friendly but clearly understaffed (expected due to COVID & devastating effect on the hospitality industry). Upgraded to larger king room with no view in east wing and spent next 3 nights getting lost trying to figure out how to get from room to lobby or room to perking lot. Signage could be enhanced. It required us to walk to end of wing, take elevator down to 2nd floor, then through the indoor pool area (ah… the smell of chlorine), then through a hallway of photos, then either down a flight of stairs or the elevator.

Check In staff was very nice and very welcoming.  Our room was very clean, well stocked with everything that we could ever need, We ate three meals at the Jackalope grill. I would recommend eating off the menu for breakfast.  I had the El Capitan Omelet it was very good, I also had the Country style eggs Benedict.  This was very good also.  my wife had the scrambled eggs carnitas tacos, steel  cut oatmeal and the Avocado Ciabatta Toast.  All were very good.  We only ate breakfast at the hotel.

The cabin was clean and cozy. The fireplace really made it feel like home. The view from our balcony was beautiful. The cabin is great for those who want to be a little removed from everything as it is a bit of a walk (or a short drive) to the the main hotel where the amenities are located). There are multiple fire pits in between the cabins so you’ll find one close no matter which cabin you’re in.   We loved the food at the on site restaurant, Jackalope’s (at the main hotel). The vegetable pot stickers were a favorite. The pool was pristine and the underwater music was an unexpected joy. Archery & rock wall activities are available but require a reservation/appointment.

It is a beautiful place but we could not tell that when we got to room 203.  We had a view of nothing but a roof and two satellite dishes.  Taken alone, our list of issues was not bad.  However when put together they result in a 'we won't be back' one night stay.  Aside from the 'view', we encountered bartenders who treated customers to gripe sessions about their lack of help, the restaurant host who had no idea what the word 'corkage' meant, room doors that slammed loudly up and down the hall, thin walls and ceilings that treated us to snoring and footsteps at all hours, confusing signage (ok, now I was looking for things - too bad I kept finding them), out of service TV in the fitness center"

We recently spent 4 days / 3 nights at Tenaya during the kids' autumn break. We booked their ""Fido Friendly"" package which was supposed to come with a dog-friendly room, amenities for the dog like bed, bowls, treats, toy, etc.  The booking was at one of their Explorer Cabins. Granted, the cabins are relatively new, with modern decor, good heating, etc.; HOWEVER the cabin village is pretty far removed from Tenaya lodge itself. The Club House was shuttered, and while I understand that during COVID the housekeeping is optional - there are absolutely no amenities in the cabins outside of 4 Keurig pods and 2 paper cups.

We came here for a ""deluxe"" vacation following too many that had been cancelled due to the pandemic. Was really encouraged when we arrived to see that masks were not required of fully vaccinated individuals. It was all down hill from there!  We had a cabin (one of their most expensive bookings) but found out that NOTHING is working or available.  Only 1 of 3 restaurants open!  No room service... Explorer club house... shuttered. We get better service at $150/night motels than what they have here at $500/night.

Being rerouted due to the fires in Sequoia, we didn’t know what to expect but this was recommended and we booked with no idea what we were getting. It is a bit pricey but so spotlessly clean and comfortable. They provided walking sticks for hiking, flashlights for the pathways leading to the cabins and it is only minutes from the south entrance to Yosemite. There are front porches on each cabin and community fire pits throughout the cabin areas lit each night for all to enjoy. It was very quiet when we were there. The lodge area was a bit more bustling but the only place for food. It was open till 10 and thinned out later in the evening. The food is actually so delicious and the servers fantastic.

The same situation at the pool bar where there is even a rude bartender who treats people like dogs. No one would tell you what the ammenities of the hotel are or what activities you can do. Theres no hospitality at all. You are by yourself. The price for that disappointing experience is at least $ 450 a night."

Probably all the other accommodations in the area are also expensive.  Just be aware that you get nothing special at Tenaya Lodge.  Our cottage unit was one of 3 in a single building, and pretty cramped.  The lodge pool is very crowded and noisy with kids; the separate adult pool is barely 20 feet away, and thus just as noisy.  Next time, I""ll stay in Oakhurst - 20 minutes down the hill, but much better value.    do NOT eat at the Tenaya Lodge's Timberloft pizzeria - frozen pizza served with a scowl."

We returned to Yosemite last week and since it was for only one night, decided to stay in the main hotel. What a mistake! Our ""deluxe"" room did not have working a/c. The fans kept going on but the room never went below 82 degrees! Finally I opened the window and then it got very cold. So I spent the night opening and closing the window as the temperature alternated between very hot and very cold. But wait, there's more!

Only one other restaurant which was a bit high end for us. This area is rather isolated, compared to oakhurst but closer to Yosemite.

However, the rest of the hotel was very meh--first off, the picture here (on TripAdvisor) is such a glamor shot, it's a little ridiculous when you actually see it. The pool was packed with children from 9-9, so obviously not fun. The dinner is decent, but of course overpriced--and they have a serious bee problem on the patio which makes dining outside unreasonable (and really, more could be done about the bees--very unclear why management wasn't taking additional steps for comfort on the patio, especially in light of COVID/being safer eating outside)."

Buck Meadows Lodge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32460-d3539405-Reviews-or10-Buck_Meadows_Lodge-Groveland_California.html#REVIEWS,"The first thing to note about Buck Meadows is that it's about an hour's drive from Yosemite Valley. So make sure you allow for that, if you want to get to there reasonably early - as you should, if you're going at a busier time of year. And the prices seem to vary quite a lot, though it's still compares favourably with places inside the park. Having said that, everything else is pretty positive. The room was a decent size, comfortable and well kept. The open air pool was welcome at the end of the day. And the on site restaurant is perfectly good, with notably friendly service."

The lady at the front desk presented us with a credit card slip to sign, requiring payment up front for more than the price agreed via the internet booking.  She had little interest in resolving the discrepancy, was less than welcoming and indeed came over as totally indifferent to her new guests.  That said, I spoke to her the following day and was greeted with a smile (everyone can have a bad day) Fortunately our room when we got to it was pretty nice.  It was a King Cabin (609) and set back behind the row of rooms nearest the road, so away from any road noise.  The front had a porch with a couple of chairs, whilst out the back we had nice views of the meadow.  Inside was a decent"

We've stayed at many places in the area.  We've returned to Yosemite Westgate Lodge several times now.  It appears to have changed ownership since our last visit, we could tell right away. The front desk folks were extremely helpful. Our room was spacious and clean.  Because it was in the off season, the hotel was very quiet. There was snow on the ground outside but we were toasty warm in our room. Their ammenities include,Microwave, frig, hairdryer, Keurig coffee maker, TV, etc.  Anyway, we'll stay again.

The lodge is located right on the highway, but this is not really an issue. There is a restaurant on site where we had dinner and it was good value and good american food. There is fuel available at the RV park next door, which is handy given the lack of available fuel along CA120. The room we had was clean, comfortable and reasonably up to date (it looks as though there had been a recent refresh - maybe a repaint and furnishings). The only downside was when the owners tried to charge us around $20 more than the guaranteed rate through booking.com (it took about 5 minutes of arguing with 3 separate people before we got our guaranteed rate)."

If it looked like photos,  it would be cute.   Responsiveness of staff was good.    However, it looks shabby.  Simple cosmetic changes would go a long way. There was no ice, no gravy. Jalapeños were bad.  A big one — there was NO handicap parking at either level of premises.   Also in the restaurant my husband has to send his beef back as he requested medium. When it came out, it was not much improved.   The room has  a disgusting broken floor lamp and a welcome mat that was long past its day.  For almost $300 a night!!!    Really?

Even the room at 1st glance looked good.  But the bed was OLD and all broke down. NOT comfortable at all. The furniture is dated and in some disrepair. The bathroom needs a update and repairs. Missing a piece of baseboard and insulation showing through. The unit I stayed in had a outdoor deck .Nice feature but for the $250 a night you could at least take a hose to the deck. The service was good and was clean but needs a update. Not saying made modern just fixed up.

We originally booked a stay at Tenaya Lodge but TL cancelled our reservation due to COVID restrictions (the whole hotel was closed). Scrambling to find a new option for our trip to Yosemite, I stumbled upon this Inn. The pricing was excellent and the ambiance was also great! It’s a quiet little B&B that I would recommend anyone stay at. The overall vibe was an old school cabin that belongs in a “All Things Cozy” publication.  Shoutout to the staff who were delightful and happy to explain any questions we had. We purchased a local wine that was on display and the woman behind the desk gave us glasses and a corkscrew to take back to our room. I would stay there again no doubt!

Nothing like the website portrayed. We really arent picky as we use Comfort/Quality Inns alot. Our biggest issue is the curtain on the door doesnt even cover the window. See pics. 😲 the bathroom curtain was the same way but at leat the gap was at the top of the window above heads. The fridge was precariously perched on a stool. Very wobbly. The wall stuff was dusty. The air-conditioner DID NOT WORK. We woke several times sweating and couldn't do a thing about it. 😒 The bedding top covers were old. Such a disappointment as we thought we had a cozy authentic place in a good location. 😭 I understand that location can be everything but what a mess. 😳

My check in was quick and friendly once they got past the guests in front of me with a myriad of questions.  Some would describe this hotel as quaint and rustic but to me it was a small room in dire need of renovation.  The bed was too soft for my taste and would creak whenever you roll over.  The A/C was noisy and the thermostat was a bit wonky and it will infringe on your moment of peace sitting on the front deck.  The hot water in the tiny shower was a bit here and there too.  There was only one set of towels in the room but the front desk had more available.  There is no maid service until check out.  Wifi is almost non-existent and my T-mobile cell reception didn't work for me either.

We had the second most basic options, but unfortunately because of a heater that did not work it was still bitterly cold at night (basically there is no isolation whatsoever). People where not friendly (not unfriendly either, but just felt they did not care). Breakfast pancakes where drie as dirt and came with little syrup. Could be much better."

The description sounded great (even the fact that it was basic accommodation with shared facilities was not an issue) and also the location 'next to the river' appealed to us so we made a booking. What we didn't realize is the altitude where Bridgeport lies and that in September it can easily be below zero during the night. So on arriving at the site we were a bit 'nervous' what to expect, but during check-in that nervousness was taken away. Why? The wagons are equipped with electric blankets so we didn't have to worry about the cold temperatures during the night (it made the stay even better).  Furthermore, the wagons are indeed next to the river and with having"

Room was nice in a quirky rustic, basic cosy way. All wooden lodge which was probably the upper end of the rooms available. There was some sort of cabin toilet/shower block accommodation available even a covered waggon with a double bed only inside. A bit pricey for what was on offer but no complaints. Intended to eat breakfast and dinner here but was disappointed to see how more it would cost compared to what was on offer in Bridgeport."

Other stops along the way proved to be not as nice as we thought, but we were really hopeful that this place would be different.  At first, this seemed to be true- the place was very clean, restaurant adjacent to the motel & cabins, etc & the room itself was quite spacious, clean & decorated in the 'log cabin' style suited for this beautiful part of the country.

We were there for our Anniversary during this Covid time and we felt very safe.  From the moment you are greeted by Megan you know that you are going to have 5 Star Service.  We had a private dinner prepared by Rhonda for our anniversary and words cannot even describe how wonderful it was.  It was a bit pricey, but the best Filet Mignon I have ever had, that is not an exaggeration.   We took 2 1/2 hours for dinner and just relaxed, drank wine and really connected.  It was just so nice to be out after locked up for so long from Covid and this B&B gave us that opportunity.  We will not be waiting for a special occasion to go there again, as it was a treasure and so happy we have found them."

We were traveling with a less than easy going 5 year old, and Rhonda made sure that she was happy here. We woke up the first morning to the best breakfast I've ever had.

It is walkable to get down and back, but at our age (70s), we preferred to drive. Lovingly restored, it features nicely decorated rooms with baths, friendly staff and elaborate breakfasts. Also friendly cats, ducks and a dog. Coffee and tea are available all day in the library, and bowls of candies abound, if you need a little sugar shot. We had the original guest room on the ground floor, perfectly adequate, but the rooms on the second floor are larger. One comment, though: there are so many bibelots strewn around in both bedroom and bathroom that we found it hard to put down our books, toiletry kits, etc. That having been said, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Inn nor to return"

We saw deer, wild turkey and plenty of hummingbirds.  The property is also home to three horses and 11 chickens which guests are able to visit anytime.  Deborah also gave us great advice on what to do in Yosemite.  Lastly, her Mexican Food recommendation in town (Cucina Michoacana) was great.  That restaurant is unreal!

We stayed in the Ranch Room and would highly recommend it as it’s the only room with a private hot tub. The only thing we didn’t realize is it’s about a 45 minute drive into Yosemite everyday. However, the drive is pretty and being able to stay at the Red Tail Ranch makes the drive worth it!"

We decided to spend time closer to home and chose to go hiking near Yosemite and stay at the Red Tail Ranch.

We were greeted with a bottle of Italian Chianti that Kevin had purchased special for us.  There was a lovely little note about the Ranch not being Italy but that they hoped we enjoyed our time there.  We sure did!

The decorative touches are lovely but she excels at the necessities. No matter what you might need to hike in yosemite, she has it. Hats, raincoats, walking sticks, etc. And she hasnt neglected the ""at home"" needs/wants either. Movies, books, guidebooks to plan your hikes, it's all there. The room was extraordinarily comfortable, the gardens amazing, the home cooked breakfasts are to die for. Leaving early? Sherilee will pack you a to go with home made muffins, fruit, etc. Sherilee herself is warm, welcoming and extremely knowledgeable about yosemite. Don't hesitate to ask her for the best hikes for what you like. I have never recommended a place as highly as I do this one."

Sherilee even put a birthday candle in my yogurt so my boyfriend could sing ""Happy Birthday"" to me. I was impressed by the breakfast Sherilee and her mom prepared each day! Way more 'fancy' than I expected. Both of them are patient and are the most amazing hosts. During breakfast be sure to pick Sherilee's brain about Yosemite. SHE KNOWS"

Yes it’s some distance from Yosemite (35 mins to park entrance and probably 90 mins to Yosemite Valley) but it’s a stunning place and we were met with such a genuine, warm welcome.  We stayed two nights in Clouds Rest which is in the main house and has a balcony overlooking trees and mountains in the distance. The room was big, great comfortable king bed, big TV with a huge selection of DVDs, bathroom with large tub and separate walk in shower.   We followed the suggested itinerary from our host for a one day tour of Yosemite and decided to get up early. We were on the road by 0630 with our lovely breakfast to go with delicious homemade muffins. Would recommend doing this as it enabled us to stay ahead of the crowds all day.

Breakfast was served in a veranda which was fenced of with gauze. Again not very appealing. Breakfast itself was very specific. No personal choice.

Unfortunately due to limited access to the park we were unable to secure day passes.  I emailed to cancel and they refused to give me a refund even tho it was SEVENTEEN DAYS NOTICE.  I made the mistake of not seeing they take 50% no matter what after you book.  NO REFUNDS NO MATTER WHAT. Covid, death, they don’t care.  I would recommend booking with a hotel that during a pandemic is willing to be reasonable and provides refunds with ample notice."

It's located on a fairly steep hillside in an oak ravine. Didn't try any star gazing because of limited view area and too much outdoor lighting.  Supposedly there are hiking trails to the top of the hill for a better view but we didn't use them as only there overnight,  Cabins are cute and roomy but cleanliness is questionable in this time of Covid 19.  Smelled stuffy, there was something black in the drawer with the silverware (not a dead bug) and we just tossed it and washed all the silverware. Lobby didn't have any COVID precautions other than please wear a mask. Quick hot water and water pressure but I think they need to test their well water; we had been drinking out of our water"

Not what I was expecting. I don’t think the 9.4 review on hotels.com is real. The white lady innkeeper is rude. I don’t know if she is really like that or she is just racist because we are asian. We booked 2 rooms and had one extra guest (which we know most of the hotels don’t really care about). Just because we had one extra person, she wanted us to just leave and look for somewhere else to stay even though we already paid $600 for 1 night. Very expensive. After long minutes of begging. She said she doesn’t care about the money but eventually, she just added $68 fee for the extra guest we have. Terrible. T.V and wifi NEVER worked on our whole stay.

We opted to stay at cheaper places most days, but we knew after a long hike at Yosemite, we’d want something a little more comfortable. Homestead Cottages more than met our expectations. The room was awesome and very clean. We had a little trouble getting the A/C to cool the room down, but Danny took care of it in less than 10 mins after we called. The breakfast was continental and more than sufficient for us as we were heading to the next hike right after. The only negative was the tap water. It was a little cloudy and my wife had an upset stomach shortly after drinking some. We can’t definitively attribute it to the water, though I had some the following morning in my coffee and had some stomach cramps as well."

The last visit was in February when the snow covered the ground and skiing was great.  We rented a cabin just across from the cross-country skiing hut, so my view washing dishes looked like a picture post card.  I had a place rented last October, but the fires made that impossible - along with Covid 19.  My next trip is planned for May when everything will be bright green.  Over the years, Mammoth has changed, but Tamarack has managed to maintain its charm.  If you want to wild and party hardy, rent a condo in town - this isn't a good fit.  If you want quiet and beauty, rent here.  I' looking forward to May when I get to go back!"

We love this hotel and its gorgeous old-fashioned ambiance. The Lakefront Restaurant serves really great food and the lodge staff is lovely.  But the cabin we stayed in had gone to the seedier side of historic.  Shortly after checking in and entering the room, I had a fairly serious allergic asthmatic attack, likely from a combination of dust and mold as well as the smoke from the Northern CA fires. The carpet was ancient and dirty - you couldn’t walk on it without shoes - and the paint was flaking off the outside of the cabin. Some kind of animal family was living in the ceiling and there was a rat trap left in the room. Linens and towels were fine, bed/mattress was ok, and the kitchen was nicely equipped.

Drake was our bar tender, and made us feel instantly at home and welcome. We were seated quickly and had the best service from Bodie, a New England transplant that regaled us with stories of his time in Tehachapi. I let Bodie know that i was a vegetarian and he got with the cook and made me something really special. Soooo flavorful! My wife got the trout and said it was the best trout she’s ever had. Just a great evening at a special place with some delightful people. Highly recommended."

The jacuzzi tub was nice and big but unfortunately when we tried to use it the water came out pink (Derek thought maybe it had something to do with the rain but he had no definite answer for us).

There are also a number of nice outdoor areas on the 1st and 2nd levels to sit and enjoy the evening (or morning). Couple of things to note: 1) Groveland is a VERY small town with limited dining options. 2) The hotel is right on 120 so there is traffic noise if you're in one of the front rooms. 3) There are no elevators, so if stairs are an issue for you, request a ground floor room. 4) The a/c"

Groveland Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g32460-d113786-Reviews-or15-Groveland_Hotel-Groveland_California.html#REVIEWS,Lovely small hotel with amazing staff.  Shelly at the front desk was so personable!   The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable.  Note that the rooms in the back hear the patio music until 9pm.  And they could add a better mirror in the room I was in #4. But a great experience overall.

The food was also incredible!  I'm a foodie and the salad had the freshest tomatoes and lettuce, felt like it must have been grown and picked right outside!  Also the cheese and meat charcuterie board, both Kona and I enjoyed!  :), mild yet flavorful cheese carefully picked out.  Perfect combination of flavors!  The local community is just a nice place to stroll around, don't miss the nursery nearby the garden there is so welcoming and tranquil."

There was no bath tub mat making taking a shower a risky challenge. The bed was comfortable, but had no blanket. The pillows were the best part of the room (or I was just really tired).

The grounds and rooms are well maintained. Rooms are roomy and seem recently refurbished. There is a good restaurant that is popular with locals. An ample breakfast is included. The service team was friendly and helpful. Buildings are located on a somewhat steep hill that might prove challenging to the less fit who are lodged up the hill (although these are the best rooms with a view in my view). Those who don’t want to climb the hill can drive up and down."

Dine in is currently closed due to COVID but guests can get coffee, tea, and juice from the dining area. All beverages are single serve so it's very safe from getting cross contaminations.

We spent a week in the lodge.   The room was a decent size, and had lots of storage space. Having a fridge was great. We did go shopping before getting to the park, so we did breakfast and lunch on our own. We found the beds comfortable.   It's not a 5 star hotel, but it doesn't pretend to be. If you want that, pay for the Ahwanee. The room had a rustic feel, which seemed appropriate for the location. And speaking of location, it doesn't get any better! You can walk out your door and see the falls within minutes.   The thing we missed this year were the shuttles. We didn't realize how much we relied on them. However, the front desk people (who were incredibly friendly and helpful to us), told us that because they can't"

Is it a 5-star hotel? NO , but it gets a 5-star rating because of where it is. Incredibly convenient location , just park the car and start walking. Restaurants/bar/shop within 200 yards of your room , view of Yosemite Falls right outside your door , sit on your balcony /patio and watch bears walk by.  Rooms are basic but have what you need; Fridge , good TV with cable , functional internet speed ( no , you can't stream videos etc ) and fast wireless reception ( at least with Verizon ). This is the only place we would ever stay while in Yosemite."

Honestly I used to get frustrated from time to time with Delaware North (the past concessionaire) but Aramark has set a new low bar with even higher prices. AND it will be this way for 10 years. I'm glad to have so many other Natl Parks to visit. The food is low quality and tasteless for high $, the rooms may or may not be clean, the internet service is poor, and the desk personnel know little about the Park. I have been coming to Yosemite 2-3/yr for the past 20 yrs. I have never experienced the Park in such disarray.

We had an upstairs room in a building near the dining hall - which I was happy about because I prefer to be upstairs whenever possible. The room was clean, I checked every corner of the mattress, bedding and every other upholstered surface in the room and I didn't find anything concerning. There isn't an air conditioner but there were two box fans in the closet, so we propped them up infront of the balcony door on a luggage rack to draw some of the cool/fresh air into the room.

You’re paying for the privilege to stay in the valley.  If it means that much to you, (and it might!)  then this hotel is ok and these cons might not be so bad:  1. You can feel the springs in the bed 2. Pretty much no wi-fi available in the rooms- but might reach yours if you’re in the right place. 3.

Very worth a stay for its historic context, but perhaps not in the middle of 100 degree summer with no AC"

A day prior, when we called them to get some information, they told us that that room couldn't hold 4 people.   The supervisor listened to the recording of the original booking and admitted the mistake and gave us two options - (1) get a full refund (2) upgrade it to a more expensive room (at twice the rate).   At that stage, we had no other option but to accept the upgrade.  The supervisor promised to talk to the onsite manager to explore offering some discount. He never called back. Upon reaching the hotel, we explained the situation to the manager, who, at first, kept repeating the two options offered to us as if we were slow. Finally, he promised to talk to the day manager. Nothing happened.  And all this while"

Again, a national park isn't subject to the openings of CA. They have their own rules. The staff are incredibly friendly and willing to help, despite limited resources. I stayed in a room without a bath, but the shared bath facilities were very clean and close to my room. No problem.

The topic of discussion was how terrible a company aramark is and that management is running a #%it show.

Our bathroom was separated from the neighbouring bedroom by a not very well-fitting door so that we could hear absolutely every word they said.  However it was very comfortable.

In our experience, the staff was nothing but helpful in every single encounter. Everyone that worked there, from the bellmen, the front desk clerks, the bar staff, the waitstaff and the concierge employees, were professional, courteous, and generally falling all over themselves to be of assistance. The food in the main dining room for dinner was of the quality you would expect at a similarly priced restaurant outside the park - my husband said that the prime rib was the best he'd ever had at a restaurant. Even the wine selection was"

There were long lines to order at the bar but the beer selections are top notch.  The views from the huge balcony connected to the presidential suite are amazing.

The hotel is very old with recent upgrades within the last ten years which adds to the charm.  We stayed in one of the cottages with a view of the forest.  It was quiet, appointed with two double beds and a private bathroom.  The room had a TV and bistro table in the room and a patio bistro table outside with air conditioning.  The room was quiet.  The room had USB outlets in the room but Wi-Fi is slow which is not surprising for being in a mountainous area.  There is a bellman on site who was very helpful at making recommendations of sites to see within the park.  The buffet brunch in the main dining room is wonderful with assortments of pastries, fruits and hot food items."

The Ahwahnee rates near the bottom. This is largely because we had stayed at El Tovar in Grand Canyon a few weeks earlier. For a little bit more money than Ahwahnee, we had the amazing Fred Harvey suite with a bedroom, large living room and ginormous killer terrace overlooking the Grand Canyon.  So we arrive at the Ahwahnee around 7:30 p.m. (having stopped to hike up Mt. Hoffmann!). First, there is no porter outside.  Second, the clerk is barely cordial. Third, the small motel room (VERY EXPENSIVE ""Classic"" double with view) is on the second floor looking at trees and the yard. I pleaded with the manager, who moved us to a nicer room (upgrade cost of course) with tiny balcony."

Booked a cottage room, luckily there was AC unit in room to fight 100F temperature. It was probably the one good thing.  Waited 2hrs for housekeeping to get the room ready, but only to find out there was a used K-Cup in the coffee machine, but no K-Cups for me, no water glasses, had to ask for them.  The mattress was terrible, not sure how many years they have been in use, it couldn't hold and support normal weights, so literally we sank into the mattress. I was able to tolerate it but my wife spent her night in the couch!  There are so many lodgings just a few miles outside the park entrance, if you don't mind additional 30mins driving, do choose lodging outside the park."

First few things I could not find online, and need to be cleared up:  1. Parking: you can park there BEFORE you check in. Check in is at 5, but they can give you parking permit as early on that day as you want! So do not worry about parking - just go there and find a spot, then go to reception and tell them you are staying at the hotel. They will find your reservation and give you a parking permit to display (yes, you need that!). 2. Dinner reservation: is not that hard to get. It is only available to HOTEL GUESTS, and everyone else can come on the basis of availability. So guests have priority as long as they reserve a spot.

Decided this ‘bucket list’ vacation was due so I started my search.  *See below for park entrance info-it’s a WHOLE new process.   Though The Ahwahnee is very pricey, I was prepared to pay for several nights but only ONE day/night was available there all the way through September 2021! Again, plan ahead-even a year ahead if you’re determined to stay here. Ok, so this GORGEOUS 1927 hotel is the most grand, the most beautiful lodge you could imagine. The building itself, the furnishings, the enormous fireplace, the views and the rooms, all spectacular. My takeaways: If you can request a balcony room, do it-it totally made the stay incredible."

There is also a convenience store and a take out food place, along with an outdoor clothing store.  It can get quite crowded.

Half a day was enough to head up to Mirror lake, over to Yosemite Village, Lower Yosemite Falls trail with lunch, bottom of El Cap and back to the lot.

The ""cabins"" are separate units in either a 2-plex or 4-plex that are spread out in a wooded area 25-50 yards from a parking lot. Concrete pathways lead to some but not all of the units, so don't count on rolling your luggage from your car to the cabin.  We stayed in a 2-plex cabin that shared one wall with the other unit. The other 3 walls had windows that opened to the outdoors. The common wall bordered the bathroom and walk-in closet. We did not hear any sounds from our neighbors.  The cabin was furnished with bedding, towels, hand soap, shower gel and shampoo, one double bed and one single bed, a bedside stand with lamp, full size chest of drawers, built-in desk, 2 chairs, tabletop oscillating fan, wall"

We ended up with dropping off one person with all the packs at the trailhead, the other went to park and then hitched back to the trailhead.  Not ideal!

They canceled our High Sierra Loop hike in 2017 because of too much snow. When we had to cancel last minute in 2018 because smoke made it an unhealthy choice they did not fully refund our money. How can they justify keeping a portion of our fees when a natural disaster caused the cancellation? Don't trust them as they DO NOT CARE!

We did not get a place in the lottery but got places at 4 of the camps once the lottery people had been placed.  We started at May Lake and finished at Vogelsang.  One problem was the lack of a shuttle bus as we wanted to leave our car parked at the end of our journey so had hoped to shuttle bus to the trail to May Lake.  We ended up with dropping off one person with all the packs at the trailhead, the other went to park and then hitched back to the trailhead.  Not ideal!  I would imagine other hikers had issues with this too. We hiked a total of 36 miles.  These were challenging hikes with some steep climbs and rocky terrain.  We did 'train' for months beforehand although we are in reasonable"

Hiking the High Sierra Camps is like being on a cruise but hiking to each destination.  The camps even emphasize using sanitizer and washing your hands like cruise ships do.   The food is absolutely yummy.  You will not go hungry.  You get multiple courses for bfast and dinner, and if you aren't full, you can ask for more.  The $16 optional lunches are a good buy.

The Sunrise camp is located across from an enormous meadow with a view of Yosemite's mountain ranges. The May Lake camp is along a beautiful lake overlooking Mount Hoffman. The Glen Aulin camp is right by a waterfall along the Tuolumne River. One couldn't ask for a better location to hike into, star gaze, and take in the awesome mountains. Each of the camps is 7-8miles away. That makes for a strenuous but entirely feasible hike. You will be hiking by lakes and through alpine meadows filled with flowers and butterflies.

After the first day we saw very little if any smoke.  If you are concerned about the smoke, I would say it’s all clear at this point.  The trip was fantastic.   Ranger James was the best and our group was terrific.  I recommend a fleece sleep sack if you run cold as my silky/polyester sack only made me colder.   We had a range of ages in our group up to 72 years old and everyone did great.  If you take a lot of breaks and go slow and steady you will be fine.   I recommend long walks and interval cardio to prep.   We arrived at Tuolumne two days in advance to acclimate to the elevation and it made a big difference.

We were given a spot for 2018. We watched as the Ferguson fire caused the shutdown of major portions of Yosemite, and expected High Camp once again to be canceled. When it was not canceled we attempted unsuccessfully to get ahold of them to assess conditions. Ultimately due to the health limitations of several in our group, doctors' recommendations, and the smoke and fire conditions in Yosemite, we decided to cancel. We sent email notification of our concerns and cancellation a month in advance, but were given only a 70% refund. So, disappointed two years in a row, and very disappointed that, given dangerous air quality we were not given a full refund."

Amenities such as flushable toilets, potable water, and dumpsters are always nice. There are showers a stones throw away at the Curry Villiage if needed.   The location is gorgeous and you have a view of El Cap from the entrance and the shuttle stop makes getting around the park so easy.   My one con would be with how close all the sites are. They were much smaller than Lodgepole campground in Sequoia which is a very popular campground. But overall we had a great time and would consider camping there again."

We pulled in around 7 pm after spending the day in the park.  Since we were doing a road trip we slept in the car so there was no set up.  We stayed in #74 which was on the end of a loop so it was very spacious.  The campground was clean and quiet. A huge mountain was visible from our site. So much room for a tent (if we had one) Nice fire pit area, picnic table and large bear box. Did not see a bear but did see two very large humorous raccoons.  I've never been out west (coming from the east coast) and the stars at night were gorgeous.  It seemed like you could see a million!  Wish I could have spent longer here.  Would most definitely recommend this campground!  There is a reason it sells out so fast."

The staff were extremely helpful, especially when someone had taken our spot on the wrong day! The reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because at the time the toilets were being refurbished almost everywhere so it was difficult to get up during the night and walk to find the toilets. It was also difficult for the same reason to walk and get water for your dishes. The last reason is a bit of feedback really and i really think it would be a good idea for such a large campground to install showers as curry village is nearby but busy and expensive!"

The campground was wonderful. It was easy to get to and close to pretty much everything. The rangers all were very friendly and helpful.

Littered cigarette butts are a chronic problem. Upper Pines campground is the typical over used dirt parking lot. Take a look behind the visitor center to behold the Valley's ""garage"".

Check the road conditions if there has been any snow prior to entering The Valley.

Vernal falls is nearby and a nice 2 mile hike to get there. All the falls were raging as was the river. Our campsite was near the river and you could hear it at night. Unfortunately, our neighbor in an RV had a generator and TV going all day one day. Other than that had a good time. Upper Pines does not have any electric hook ups so it is mostly quiet. That should change once school is out and the kids are back. If you collect wood (tempting) look out as it is all still wet due to the recent rains and very smokey if you try to burn it. Use only the wood you buy at the store. The valley was majestic as usual. Perhaps our favorite place in the world and we have travelled a lot overseas."

Sites have nice fire rings with cooking grates. The only downsides in my mind are that many of the sites are in the sun (there are many trees here, but much less than other campgrounds we stayed in) and the bathroom stalls don't have locks and not all the doors want to stay closed. Bears are active there, but the rangers are vigilant about making sure people properly store food. We did not see one while we were there.

We stayed at Wawona the end of August (our very first time in Yosemite, and first time in years since me or my boyfriend have camped in tents).  The park rangers were super friendly and informative as we checked in. Wawona campground is lovely, but it's also very dry and dusty due to the drought.  The dirt is like volcanic ash, very fine.  I recommend taking a tarp to line the ground with, then pitch your tent on top.  This way you can throw a towel down to use as a floor mat before getting in and out of your tent.  I saw several campers doing this and thought it was clever.  There is also a small store close to the camp ground - they have things like firewood, chairs, cheap tents, eggs, bacon, frozen meals, chips, bread, canned goods, candy, soda, beer, wine,"

We stayed in Loop A and you can hear the road traffic late into the night and the sites are mostly just large dusty plots adjoining one another. If I go back I will definitely seek out Loop C."

Our campsite was 52 and right by the river. The river is very loud during the night and is wonderful white noise.   The campgrounds are very large and are generously spaced apart. This was very helpful as we had 3 two-person tents, 2 hammocks, and a table to fit. We even had extra room to play frisbee.  The river is beyond beautiful. Surrounded by so many trees. My recommendation would be to opt for a spot near the river rather than closer to the forest.  There are mosquitos +++  Things we didn't like: - Bathrooms can we dirty but are cleaned daily. There are no locks on the doors or lights for night. Bring a lantern. Also would recommend bringing a spare roll of toilet paper with you. - Spots near the bathroom"

The truth was this is the spot we got when reserved, it wasn't the spot I wanted. That said... it turned out great! If possible, I'd recommend staying in the loops as far back in the campground as you can go and as close to the river as you can go.   We were in the C-Loop, site 48. Things I like about it... proximity to the river (across the road), size of the site itself (large), and proximity to the bathrooms (close, but not smell-e-vision close). An added bonus was we were about 50 feet from the nearest water spigot.   Speaking of bathrooms, these are luxurious by Yosemite standard, with all flush toilets.

You can't choose your neighbors, and, as in most reservable campgrounds in Yosemite, you can't usually choose your spot.  However, the patrons here were very respectful of quiet hours and it was very family friendly.  The bathrooms were close by, and with no shower, it was great to hop in the deep, cold river in the afternoons to cool off.  We took tubes to the river each afternoon to just relax in, as did about 6-8 other people.  The river was large, cold, deep, but not flowing terribly fast.

It is also a short walk to the Half Dome trailhead (the Upper Pines and Lower Pines campgrounds are closer). If you have a bike, everything is close in my opinion.

Difficult to find initially even following the map from the centre!  Beautiful site with lots of trees and views of the mountains. Well maintained and clean and tidy. Plenty of room for our RV allowing privacy. No WiFi or on site shop. However groceries can be bought at a VERY EXPENSIVE store in the centre. If coming again I would stock up with food!

We were fortunate to get a larger site and that is why I gave it a 4 star.  I were in one of the other sites, which was the majority, I would have given this campground a 2 star.   Each time I walked to the bathroom I was astounded by how small and what little space the other campers had.    There is drinkable water and there were bathrooms with running waters.   The bathrooms were dirty most of the time.  Even though we are out in the wilderness and sleeping in dirty, hygiene is a concern.  At times it would have been safer to use the woods (which is unrealistic here).     The transportation system is great!   There are stops 1 through 20 and the bus runs all day for free and in that order. The stop at North Pines is 18 and Curry Village"

It has some type of vents on the ground making much of the campsite unusable.  If you have a tent, you will wind up pitching your tent slightly in the next campsite.  This campsite also is in a large wide-open loop with no privacy.  With all that said, this campsite in within Yosemite Valley which is one of the hardest places to book campsites.  The campground is clean and filled with families with kids having a good time.   There are restrooms with flush toilets, running cold water and bottle filling stations.  The closest showers are 2 shuttle bus stops away or a 15 minute walk to Half Dome Village."

First of all, I really love the campground because it's a bit set apart from the others and seems to be quieter.  There is a river running through it, which often leads to flooding at certain times of the year, but it's a peaceful place and we love staying here when we're in Yosemite and lucky enough to have a reservation.  With that said, our experience with the hosts/volunteers the last time we visited was awful and I think the park should know and be aware of this.

You can still have a campfire here in the evening hours.  The water levels are still low and fishing isn't that great."

The facilities are limited to only restrooms but there is running water and water fountains at each block so you don't need to bring all your water.  The site is perfectly located for the Vernal and Nevada falls walks as its towards the East of the valley floor. We're very glad we stayed here instead of sharing a plot on Camp 4.   We were fortunate and got a spot less than a week in advance (midweek, 14th-16th Sept) so don't give up hope of looking for a late booking!

Bathrooms were not clean, most sites were small and cramped. Our first site (#201) the camper's tent behind us was so close to our campfire ring that our chairs were next to their tent! Dusty campsites and with the horse stables next door, adding more dust and manure smells - not so awesome. Views were great and there are sites along the river, which if u can get one towards the back, I'm guessing the smell and dust is less. I think if we go back I'd camp in upper pines or pick sites further from the horse stables. My advice - book early and research site locations - be picky!"

They have a dish flush, drinking water that you can fill up and the ranger is so nice. It was walking distance to the bridge where on the 4th of July we stood on the bridge with others and watched the night stars full of STARS... listening to the water streaming down. It was stunning.

The cabin was clean, well furnished, everything we needed for a 5 night stay was in the cabin. Directions were clear, the owners accommodating and responsive.  The cabin was our relaxing oasis to grill out a steak and have a few beers/glass of wine and relax after hiking or seeing the sites.  Book this - you will not be disappointed.  We had 2 adults in the cabin (couple) but the loft would easily hold an older child and the sofa was very comfy and would sleep one too.

We stayed one out of three booked nights and everything was fine. A nice little hut with everything we needed- simple & remote in the middle of Foresta. When we came from the mountain next day the idea was to sit outside the cabin, a nice book & some BBQ. Actually there was a fire around Foresta and we couldn't get in. The odysse we experienced without IDs (cabin) or Credit Cards (cabin) or even clothes are a different story. But what needs to be said: Steve, the manager of Hilltop, somehow arranged that we get an escorted transfer to the cabin to get our stuff the next day. And, he refunded fairly the two nights we could not spend there. When we come back to Yosemite we would choose again Hilltop Cabins."

We stopped in a town along the way (Dublin) to pick-up dry goods at a Safeway and save some money on groceries in the Valley.

The hot tub is great.  The bed is comfy, but a little soft and saggy in the middle.  A few cautions: 1) The Sage and Lupin cabins are right next to each other.  If you have noisy neighbors (we didn't) you will suffer.  2) The area is still recovering from a major fire, and the surrounding trees are just saplings.

Directions are complicated but accurate and we got there without any hiccups though didn't drive in the dark. You have to watch out carefully for the signs especially when returning from the Village.

The owners Doe & Chris were very helpful in advance of our booking and also were on hand to help out while we were there, they were never anything but the most polite and helpful people.

It was a great, cute cabin about 25 min from the valley.  The drive is very hilly and curvy and you have to go very slow in the dark.  Also lots of deer about.  We loved the hot tub, especially after climbing Half Dome!  Our neighbors were very quiet and we never saw them, so we felt like we had the whole property to ourselves.  The kitchen was fully stocked, even with coffee, spices, oils etc.  I wish we'd known because we bought a lot that we didn't use.  Also we have AT&T and there was NO cell reception.

It is a drive to see some Main attractions but there is a lot to see in the meadows. It rained for 2 days including lightning so prepare for that possibility. If you are lucky enough to get a reservation get there early to get a good spot. We had a huge site right by the river. We have a very large 8 person and a smaller tent and it fit perfectly. The bathrooms were kept very clean. Make sure to bring a bucket to wash your dishes in.

My advice is also to put a tent right away, because later someone can take it without permission. This happened to us, we came at night and someone put their tent in our spot. Unfortunately, people don't respect. And also better to do it in a day, because after sunset it's very dark there and the camp doesn't have any lighting at all. It is a very big disadvantage (very scary to go to the batroom at night). Another disadvantage for us was the service. We checked-in quite early, and we asked a place somewhere in the middle of"

The 200 loop was fine with adequate space between sites, level tent areas, working fire pits and picnic tables, and a use-able bathroom building though one of the stalls and one of the sinks were out of order. And for the price of the sites, there should be hot water and lights in the bathroom building.  There is neither! On the other hand, our sites on the 400 loop were horrible. Not enough space next to noisy (large group) neighbours, plus extremely hilly sites, broken picnic table on a slant that could not be made level, and 2 of the bathroom buildings were shut down altogether.  One had a row of dirty construction site portable toilets outside.  We did locate one bathroom building that was open but it was a messy disaster"

Our site, as many others, was relatively close to the sites on either side, but that's kind of the nature of the ecosystem there. Next time we'll aim for site on the outside perimeter of the campground. I've also seen better restroom facilities at State Parks--but all around a decent campground.   A few issues:  -When we arrived, the sinks in the men's restroom were clogged. The host said they'd put in a work order two weeks ago, but the Valley always gets priority. By our second day, they had been fixed.  -The host was nice and knowledgeable, but after our first two nights, he disappeared, and so the campground was host-less at least until we left three days later.

There's a store and gas station located close by which is really convenient for last minute supplies.  I agree with the other reviews that the bathrooms need to be cleaned.   There were flush toilets and plenty of toilet paper, but the sinks and dishwater dumping stations were in bad shape.  We camped in site #116 and had plenty of privacy and space.

There was no way to keep them away, including covering everything immediately. Had to eat in the tent one night. Our second issue were the huge pine cones which were dropped by squirrels at around 8 AM and 4 PM. They would drop 3-4 of them during those time frames and eat the seeds 2-3 days later. This was happening at our neighbors site also. The issue was the size, sharpness and weight of them, over a pound. If you were hit in the head, the EMT's would be arriving.

BBQ on the patio, though only ½ of burners seemed to work and it was dirty from previous occupants. Plenty of local information and instructions"

Mikey made us feel very at home and nothing was too much trouble - we had breakfast (which is amazing, by the way) at 5 one morning and 9 the next. Also got some good tips on where to go hiking, how hard hikes really are compared to whst the books say, and what you need permits for, etc.  There were nice touches like food in the fridge for anyone to take, and we were offered a glass of wine when we arrived.  The B&B is in Yosemite West, NOT Yosemite village (which is about a 20 minute drive away).  However it was actually a relief to be up in the hills as it was cooler (75 degrees as opposed to 100 down in the valley - we were here in June). It is also near sentinel dome & glacier point which have incredible views over the valley -"

So we got Studio B 209 and Alpenglow.  Studio B 209 is beautiful with a cabin look  (pic attached), kitchen, and a nice balcony.  The second night we moved to Alpenglow hoping it would be awesome as it is expensive than Studio B.  However, Alpenglow is just a room in a house with no kitchen amenities.  We could hear people talking in the next room, and the tv in our room is broken. When we asked Mikey about the price difference, she said it is because Alpenglow comes with free breakfast - eggs,"

We like the location, inside the Park which makes it so much more convenient - no long lines to wait at the park entrance.

You could hike several miles to some view points but that's all uphill after you just drove down to the river.

Very short distance.  The rest is huge holes in dirt , so you can safely go 5 or 10 MPH without bottoming out until you get to the huge potholes.  It takes what seems like forever to get to the actual grounds, so keep going if you think you possibly took the wrong road ( Yosemite creek road is what it's called ).

Secluded, quiet;  overall a nice place to stay if you want real camping.  No big RVs with generators and massive lights destroying the peacefulness of the Yosemite night.  2)  Usually one of the very last campgrounds to fill up, so if you don't have a reservation in a Yosemite campgrounds and you arrive late in the morning, head here.   NEGATIVES 1)  The  'road' in is tough for a regular car.  I made it in my Civic, but the 4.8 mile trip took over 30 minutes and I still hit a few potholes rather hard.  Best done in a true SUV or high clearance vehicle.  I wouldn't dream of taking a RV down that old 'road'. 2)  This isn't for the unprepared or those who want some easy camping.  There is no potable water.  You need to filter,"

Camp sites seemed reasonably large, with fire rings, picnic tables, and a pretty nice sized bear locker.  Some were definitely better than others.  The worst of which stayed open the entire weekend.

A generator runs the entire night to give you the ""outdoors feeling"" seriously!!??? The superintendent should be put on report."

Left the valley at 6:45am on a Wednesday morning in order to try for two campsites in the High Sierra that would both accommodate trailers. We had our sights set on Tuolumne Meadows, but we stopped at White Wolf first just in case. We found two available sites pretty quickly, and the campground was so beautiful, we decided not to go any farther.   The campground is fairly primitive by NPS standards (no lights in the bathroom, even), but the beauty and, especially, the quiet of the surroundings more than makes up for any lack in amenities. The sites are large and well-spaced, though many of them are difficult to get into with a trailer/RV. The bathrooms aren’t bad, but do bring extra toilet paper just in"

The camp ground was wonderful!  We didn't have a reservation so traveled the camp grounds looking for a site and luckily we found one at White Wolf!  The sites vary in size, the location we stayed at was for tenting but there were a few RV's in the area too.  There were washroom facilities as well as potable water.  The only thing missing would be showers.  After a long day of hiking a shower would have been awesome!  We saw that there were showers in other areas of Yosemite but by the time we got down the trail everything was closed.  We absolutely loved the park and White Wolf Campground.  We are already planning another trip and look forward to exploring more of the area!"

Nights are really cold in tent and ground pretty hard. We recommend good sleeping bag and cushioning.   No where to have a shower here. Toilets are clean- particularly the one near the host site.

Für nur 14 Dollar pro Nacht ist er zudem auch noch günstig.  Duschen gibt es auf dem Camping leider nur für die Lodge Gäste. Die WC's sind dafür nah gelegen und sauber.

We love it! Had reservations at Hodgdon Meadows last year and Crane Flat Campground this year and canceled both to stay at White Wolf instead. The other campgrounds are very open, very sloped and not very private. The outer ring at White Wolf is woodsy, private and has the kind of ""in the woods"" feeling we like in a campground.  There are flush toilets, but no showers. I use a sun shower at the campsite. Since it's pretty private you feel very comfortable showering and then dressing in your tent. The only water is at the restrooms so bring a big water carrier (5 gallon or more) or you feel like you are constantly hauling water back to your campsite.  Love the lodge.

Yes the campgrounds are not all level, yes there is not much privacy and the campground spots are right next to each other, yes there are no showers, and yes it is far from everything. But it was quiet, clean, beautiful, has an amazing meadow to go walk around to, there are hiking locations near by and the best part for us were the camp hosts. The camp hosts made the campground. They welcomed us with smiles and jokes and gave us great information about the site. They helped us when we had multiple questions and were always friendly and cheerful around camp. We will definitely be back."

Our campsite was on a slant, so everything was at an angle... including our cots... spent the night pulling ourselves up to stop sliding off our cots.  There was also a screaming child throughout the night, so that didn't help... I get being a parent... but just not a good nights sleep.  The bathrooms are centered in the campground on top of a hill, so it was a hike UP to the bathrooms and the squirrels were pretty aggressive.   This is not a campground we would return to, unless it was the last resort.  The ranger in the booth upon entry was very friendly and fun to talk to.  He gave us some history about Yosemite that we didn't know, so that was a bright spot."

There is a bus that runs however it is very infrequent. The site has no hookups or showers and there is no potable water for filling up the RV or a dump station, for all of these things you have to go into the valley."

It's full of rough pieces of tree bark, deep ruts from rain run off, & full of tree stumps that our group kept tripping over especially after dark. Also one picnic table was broken badly & the rest are grouped in clusters or weird places & you can't move them because they are heavy. Also a lot of the bear containers are far away from the tables so you have to carry all of your food like 30 feet to get to them, why not put them closer to the tables?There are no garbage cans anywhere or water & you have to hike to the upper campground to use theirs. I could see if this campground were free, but you have to pay to come here & it"

Good campsite with friendly ranger staff (campsites on back have good forest views).  35 minutes to Yosemite valley, but gasoline and food etc service nearby.

Saw bears in craneflat meadow everyday and crossing road by tamerack.. they really do cross roads so please go slow.. campsite 103 is small and slanted hard to get two tents down, but we made it work.. other campsites right next to us..close..bathroom very close and trash, parking was close too.

We knew that our chances of staying in the valley were slim so we decided to go with Hodgdon.  Honestly, it was the best choice.  The location is beatutiful with all the trees and hikes close by.  The only draw back was that the highway leading to the valley was closed do to repairs to the road so we had to drive an extra hour to get to the valley.  In the end, it did not matter that much because the whole time you are just in awe of the views.  I definitely will be coming back."

There is absolutely no light pollution and just dirt pitches but it is so peaceful.  If you have an RV you really need some sort of levelling blocks.  Also bring your own wood as there is no where to buy any wood or provisions.  It is a very basic site but the best site we have stayed on and great for star gazing. If you are camping you have to put all your food, toiletries in a bear proof locker as there are bears on site, not that we saw any.  Make sure you pre book.  It is about 22 miles from Yosemite itself and is down a very windy, narrow road and took us about an hour to get there, a lot due to road works"

It is one of the last camp grounds to fill up and cheaper than other last-minute lodging options (hostel, hotel). I booked my camp site the night before. That said, don't have high expectations: the camping spots are very close together, parking is a night mare, the bathroom is old (although it was decently clean when I went), there are no showers, and rules and quiet hours are not enforced. I just crashed there for two nights, hiking and exploring the park from sun rise to sun down. If you are just looking for a place to sleep and all other camp grounds are filled up, this one will do."

We had a hard time finding our spot (even though by the map on their internet site, it was right by the bathroom.) We ended up having to get the camp host to help us. It was buried behind a fallen log, which had no access except to walk all the way around. There was a access road to the bathrooms which were chained off and he wouldn't let us have access to the road. We decided to make the best of it for one night. The bathrooms were just toilet and sink, and pretty rustic (no showers). At just about midnight a family of about 6 came in and set up next to us. They were barely 2 feet away from us. Trying to be as quite as possible, bless their hearts, but had a trailer they had to unhitch and push all the way around"

I stayed in tent site #11 and would NOT recommend it to anyone...it was very hilly and rocky....we came in late in the evening and were not able to clear a good spot and there are warnings about not moving the terrain around.  The plus was the generous and amply sized bear box. We were able to put our entire cooler and snack bags into the box. The campsite was fairly quiet at night even for as big as it was!

For as busy as Yosemite is, I was surprised at the outdated bathrooms!  There are so many people at the campsite I am sure it is hard to keep up, but please try and upkeep and upgrade. Our best site was #30, because it was flat and large.  Be prepared, all the campsites are close together."

However, that's based on several things that may be less applicable to other campers:  1. We live in the SF Bay Area--a 4 hour drive from the Yosemite Valley floor in light traffic--and have camped in Yosemite many times. So we can afford to be more picky than someone coming from farther away.  2. We have a small camper with a propane refrigerator that won't work unless the van is pretty level. As far as we could tell there are very few campsites--if any--at Hogdon Meadon that would enable us to level the van using Lynk Leveler blocks (or the like) enough to use the refrigerator. Meaning that in this case most of the food we had in the"

The sites are pretty much on top of one another. There were 2 sites behind ours, and those families had to walk thru our site to get to theirs.  There is a lot of noise at night and not a lot of parking.  There are bathrooms in the campground, however no showers. and no soap to wash your hands.  The campground is about a 40 minute drive to Yosemite Lodge and the Valley Floor, but it's a beautiful, scenic drive.  The rangers were nice and helpful. The fire wood is free because they let you take any wood lying around to burn.  It was overall a decent place to stay for a few days, however I wouldn't want to stay there any longer"

Nice camping cites. Camp host doesn't do anything about noise at night....all night, even till wee hours of the morning. Even when the people are next to him, across from him, they could probably even party right in his site & he would do nothing.  Worst of all the bathrooms! I've been in third world squat toilet bathrooms that were cleaner. This is not just dirty, it's 'built up dirt!' My photos were taken when it was actually clean."

I think though they are all similar... no showers etc.  It was perfectly handy for Yosemite Valley but if there was somewhere with showers etc (which there wasn't) then i would have stayed there instead.  Was a pain with people trying to park in our already booked RV pitch but you can get them to move (if you know who they are).  If you're staying in Autumn remember extra blankets... it is cold!

We traveled in a small RV, and our site (#74) had an unavoidable slant no matter how we parked, as other reviewers have mentioned--but certainly not a deal breaker.  It's Yosemite, after all. Although the campground was completely full during our stay, things were super quiet at night.  Overall, a very peaceful stay in a secluded forest setting.  We would definitely return."

Definitely one of our favorite campgrounds. This visit was really marred by the family next door in a trailer who insisted on running their generator as much as possible.

Because Yosemite takes in so many people every year, you have to consider this in selecting campgrounds, sites and use of facilities.  We were in site #63 and it is very roomy and on the outer edge of the campground.  It's less than 100 yards from one of the bathroom facilities, has a nice level and secluded site for a 4 person tent, and a great view of the stars at night from the site.    We were advised there was a juvenile male black bear in the campground, but didn't see it.  The only unfortunate event we ran into was the second afternoon we were there, a break in the main water line serving the campground caused the water to be shut down down for about 12 hours.

I typically run a Honda 2k from 5-7 pm most every day which is to make ice more than charge the batteries.

The campground gave us a great opportunity to test all of our gear and get a feel for the park while still feeling like we were with other park visitors.   The campsites here include bear vaults and a fire ring and there was also potable water and restrooms available, which was great. In addition, the campground location is a quick drive to Sentinel Dome and Taft Point -- and on the way to Glacier Point, too. Be sure to check out these great hikes and vistas if you camp at Bridalveil Creek.  Note: This campground closes in mid- to late September."

We stayed here on a Tuesday night, on the last week before they closed for the season.  We drove in early Tuesday morning and still found a few spots available. There was a good mix of RV/Tent camping.  This was our first time in an RV, so I do not know the conditions of the the camp facilities.  The campground is at 7,000 feet elevation, so you will experience colder temperatures than the valley floor.  The week after Labor Day experienced 30s at night and 60s in the afternoon.  Dress warm, especially if you are tent camping.    There was no host the last week in September, but NPS ranger came by in the morning checking each campsite.  That also means no one checking at night.  One rv left their firepit"

Almost all of the spaces were very large, the trees blocked the sun, and it's high elevation so the temps were low. However once darkness fell it quickly turned into a horror story.  It was an orchestra of car doors, car alarms, cackling, and children screaming.  Our neighbors were quiet.  All of this was coming from atleast 50-100 yards away."

We spent the week in Yosemite and camped at BCC (and enjoyed it!) We arrived at the campgrounds around 8:00 am on a Tuesday and managed to grab the last available site. Everything we have read suggested they go quickly, which is no exaggeration. 6:00am Friday morning I woke to find fellow campers circling the campgrounds looking for available sites.   Sites were clean. There were 100 sites, which means lots of people, which means lots of noise. Quite hours did not seem to be enforced, although it didn't bother me. The only complaint I have is that there were no showers. For $18/night, that just seems silly. There are NPS campsites w/ showers that only charge $5-10/night...  but then again, it is Yosemite."

Since the Ferguson Fire in 2018, this campsite no longer has any running water or flush toilets! I'm not sure when the water and toilets will be restored, but in the meantime, they have porta-potties with handwashing stations you pump with your feet that are for handwashing only. Bring your own water; and also no showers here. The campground is first come first served, unless you stay at one of the group campsites (which are reservation only). Other things to note are: no lights and absolutely zero cell reception."
