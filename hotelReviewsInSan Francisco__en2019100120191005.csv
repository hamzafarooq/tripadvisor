0,"The Metro is a fantastic hotel. The central location allows me to walk everywhere as I explore this vibrant city. The hotel and rooms are adorned with stunning paintings and artwork. Each room is different, all full of character and immaculate. I pride myself in having the fortune of staying in a number different rooms during a few recent trips. The gorgeous people at the from desk are never too busy to make recommendations to optimise my stay, further my knowledge of the area, and make me feel at home. The hotel is also perfectly placed for delicious restaurants, cafe's, shops, and bars in the neighbourhood. A friend in London originally recommended The Metro to me and it’s a tremendous find. The price is reasonable and I haven’t found anything which compares in San Francisco. This is my go to SF hotel and home away from home. I can’t wait to get back there. Well done and a million thanks!","July 4, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

1,"My partner and I absolutely loved this hotel! There are son many good points about it I've struggled to know where to start. The location is perfect, there are so many restauarants and shops around you. You're within walking distance to the painted ladies and there are multiple tram and bus stops only steps away. The people on the front desk were so friendly and helpful, saying hello and wishing us a nice time each time we came in and out of the hotel. They were more than happy to help us navigate the tram map they gave us for free. The artwork throughout the hotel was beautiful. We stayed in room 102. We were a bit worried that it would be a bit small but it was just right. Yes, the bed was the tiniest bit cramped but we didn't care. The view out to Divisadero street was lovely, watching the hubbub of San Francisco from the comfort of your room was awesome. Hopefully one day we will come back to America and back to San Francisco and we can stay here again. Thank you Metro Hotel and all of your staff for making our stay awesome!","June 24, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

3,"Great location if you are planning on enjoying Golden Gate Park. Was able to walk to many SF locations. Great food in the area. It's no thrills, but rooms are cute & clean and staff is friendly. I was on the top floor and did not mind not having a lift. Would certainly stay again.","June 10, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

4,"Originally very hesitant to book this hotel but so glad we did! Very clean & comfortable - no lift but knew this prior to booking so selected a 1st floor room (111). Great bed, small but adequate en-suite, small wardrobe. Ceiling fan/Heater. Would have liked a fridge but survived without one as most of our time spent sightseeing. MUNI bus stop very close by, approximately 15 minutes via bus to downtown. Lovely owners, helpful staff. Great rates. Would happily return & recommend to anyone looking for reasonably priced accommodation in SF.","June 8, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

5,"We booked here for 4 nights after being recommended to it by a friend who had loved their recent stay. We even cancelled another hotel we had booked and we are SO GLAD we did because the Metro is fantastic!From our arrival, where we were greeted by the nicest lady on reception (I think her name was Angie), to our departure, where we were warmly seen off by, I think, possibly the owner (extremely beautiful lady with amazing make up skills who was a DELIGHT!) everything was tip-top. I must have mentioned upon booking that we were celebrating my birthday - when we arrived into our room after a long transatlantic journey, there was a lovely, bright birthday card and a big Toblerone waiting for me - what a nice surprise!Our room was a large one at the front on the second floor, with two huge comfortable double beds and a small but perfectly formed bathroom. The shower was powerful and with plenty of hot water any time we needed it and a lovely additional touch of Trader Joe shampoo, conditioner and body wash. A hairdryer is also provided, along with plenty of room in the bathroom for all our bits and bobs. A separate toilet is a great idea - no bathroom hogging in the mornings from my partner!All areas of the hotel were clean and tidy and the area felt perfectly safe, even at night. There are lots of great places to eat and drink a short walk away - our favourites were Black Sands brewery and 4505 BBQ. Some really nice boutique stores locally, too.The location is a great one to explore from - a bus stop is right around the corner for the 6 which takes you down to Market Street to get a cable car, for example. It's also quite walkable for Haight and Golden Gate Park and the Painted Ladies are not far (I say walkable, just don't forget all those hills!).Sleep-wise, despite being on a main busy road, we didn't feel it was overly noisy. In fact, thanks to the room and our flight times from the UK, we slid right in to great sleep pattern and no jet lag, which is not something we usually manage on our frequent trips to the USA!The room had ample space to store our clothes, a TV with lots of cable channels and most importantly in this day and age - great and reliable fast wifi!The staff were only too happy to make recommendations and suggestions for places to eat and things to see and everyone had a cheery hello or goodbye when leaving and coming back for the day. I genuinely cannot think of a better place to stay in San Francisco and that's before we even get to the financials - this is GREAT VALUE! San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities on the planet but somehow this place delivers on that front too. HATS OFF, GUYS! Overall, would and will highly recommend this place to everyone and of course, will definitely be back to stay again when we are next in SF. Thanks so much to all the staff for their efforts in making our stay a memorable one!","May 27, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

6,"We stayed 7 nights at The Metro Hotel. Found it clean, quiet and friendly. Lovely shower and very comfortable bed.Ideal for exploring. Walkable to panhandle end of Golden Gate park. Bus stops very near hotel were easy to use and we bought a clipper card. Bus trips only $2.50 per time. Uber to airport on final day was $21.77.We stayed in Room 208. Fairly small but very quiet at back of hotel overlooking a small courtyard garden so away from road noise.No coffee making facilities in room but nice coffee shop 3 doors up from hotel which we used each morning. Pizza restaurant right next door was excellent but very busy and you can't book.","May 26, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

8,"This is a very good hotel in a great location. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room itself was spotless. As breakfast wasn't an option, a coffee machine would have been a nice touch, but that is a minor gripe. It was both a great place base for exploring San Francisco and to come back to in the evening, with numerous excellent coffee shops, bars and restaurants; check out Nopa, The Little Chihuahua, Barvale, Ragazza, Vinyl Cafe, etc, etc; all on the doorstep.","April 15, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

9,"It was a lovely little hotel, and the staff were super friendly. Room was a little small, but we did see larger rooms so might be a good idea to request a big room when booking. Good location, right next to Haight St, I think it was about a 20 min walk or so into the city. But it’s nice to walk around the neighbourhoods. The Italian next door and the Thai across the road is highly recommend! ","April 14, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

They recommended places to eat that were affordable, remembered when we had to be at the hospital and just overall seemed to care that our stay was comfortable.

11,"As others have said,this is not an Uber smart hotel and our room(114) was not big but everything was very clean and comfortable, particularly the bed. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful, whatever time of the day. We loved the location, close to the 1960s hippy district. Bus travel downtown is very easy and cheap. You can easily walk to golden gate park. There are some excellent places to eat and a couple of supermarkets close by.we would have liked to be able to make hot drinks in the room. There are no facilities to do this but there is an excellent coffee shop a couple of doors down which opens at 7 in the morning. This is a great place to stay for an ‘authentic’ stay in SF. Our room was very quiet and we cannot thank the staff enough for their kindness during our stay.","March 23, 2019","0    The Metro Hotel

It is situated a very convenient 30 minutes away from most tourist spots via public transport and is in a very safe and nice little neighbourhood. Staff were very helpful during our stay which we appreciated. We also liked the little touches at the hotel including umbrellas provided on wet days!

18,"The Metro is a warm, welcoming family-owned hotel and my go-to when I'm visiting my daughter who lives in the Upper Haight. Just came back from my latest visit, where I stayed in room 206 for three nights. The staff, including Shayna and Angela, are so friendly that I found myself chatting with them on my way in and out, like you would with a friend. The key things I'm looking for in a hotel are cleanliness, comfortable bed, fluffy pillows, and comfortable sleeping conditions, e.g., ceiling fan, and the Metro delivers on all of these points. The bathroom and shower are clean as well, and they don't overlook the little things, like shampoo, body wash, hand soap, and tissues. Knowing I don't have to pack some of those things is really helpful. When I did have a little trouble getting the overhead light to turn off but wanted the fan to stay on, I called Angela at the front desk and she walked me through the troubleshooting (it was an easy fix). I highly recommend the Metro Hotel for those wanting a clean, affordable stay in a happening area!","October 29, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

19,"I wasn't expecting much when I booked a hotel in San Francisco for a hundred bucks a night; but, in this instance I was pleasantly surprised. The room is small. Two people would find it a tight squeeze. Simply furnished, no bedside lamps but ceiling lights. Bed is small, but comfortable. Bath is tight, shower is small. Plenty of hangers, but no drawers. Shelves in closet are high but you are given a pouf to stand on to reach them. Twenty-four hour staff is young and friendly. Neighborhood is convenient, walkable and chock full of interesting restaurants and shops. Lobby is comfortable. Garden is usable only until five pm after which it becomes a part of a neighboring restaurant. No elevator and steep stairs. Overall, clean, efficient, affordable, friendly. I booked again for next June.","October 22, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

When I booked the Metro (at 1/3 the cost of other San Francisco hotels), I never would have guessed that this old fashioned, brownstone style boutique hotel would leave such a strong impression on us.Its charm and comfort was second only to the owner’s attentiveness and genuine hospitality.

21,"I spent 11 days overall, with my partner at the Metro Hotel in September and without a doubt, our vacation would not have been as good, if we hadn't. Aside from being everything you want from a hotel, in a great location for exploring this city and short walks from the Castro district and Golden Gate Park, what sets this hotel apart from the rest is the people who work and manage the place. From the moment we arrived Angela was so unbelievably welcoming, friendly and professional. We asked a lot of questions about things to do and using the public transport system and the help and advice we got allowed us to get around the city easily and see some amazing places. Shana gave us incredible trip suggestions both in SF and onwards to LA and personally helped make my birthday a fantastic night. Everyone who helps run the Metro Hotel went far beyond any expectations to make sure our stay was the best. We believe they all have such genuinely good hearts, that I can honestly say we miss being there. Book the Metro Hotel with confidence and have the best time, in the city we left our hearts in.","October 7, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

We used the small back patio to have a glass of champagne, very pretty. No parking but easy rideshares to other neighborhoods available. Best thing was Shana, so friendly and helpful, whose father painted all of the wonderful art in the lobby and many of the rooms. Also a very clean hotel, which I much appreciate.

23,"This hotel is in a fab location. We had the largest room at the front of the hotel, which was beautifully decorated. There is also a terrace at the back to enjoy in the evening. The only thing that stopped this getting 5 stars was the parking. If, like us you are on a road trip and need to park your car then prepare yourself. We asked at reception about parking and were told oh you can use residential, just drive around for a little bit and you will find one! 2 hours after we arrived and we were still driving around looking for a parking space. We only managed to get one because we found a spot but had to leave before 6am. The staff / hotel could have been much more helpful. You guys are the locals - it would be helpful if you could give addresses of local 24 hour parking rather than being left to drive around for 2 hours. It left us no time to enjoy the evening and by the time we got to the room we were all fed up and wanted to go to bed.

24,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Metro.Two major pluses : the price and location. By SF standards, this hotel was very affordable compared to other hotels closer to the city center. And being right on Divisadero, we found a good mix of places to have coffee and breakfast and to have dinner. It was a quick walk to the bus stops we needed to get to. Our room was small, but comfortable and very clean. The shower was also small, but the towels were especially thick and plush.There is no fridge in the room, but the front desk was happy to hold food in the lobby refrigerator for us. If you need an ironing board, they have that too. Every staff member we encountered was super friendly. Returning at the end of each day, we were always greeted with a warm welcome.

25,"Stayed here for 3 nights in September. Hotel is in a great area and costs about 30$ by Uber from the airport. Only on street parking nearby. All the staff without exception were so friendly and helpful. They were able to help us organise our trips out around the city and where to eat. The room was spotlessly clean with maid service each day. Toiletries were provided and a ceiling fan rather than aircon. There is no safe in the room or coffee machine which was a bind as having to carry your valuables everywhere. There isn’t a fridge either and the bathroom door slides on runners in the ceiling which was difficult to close/open.The hotel is on a main road and unfortunately at about 4am each day the main shop bins are emptied and a few minutes later the streets are cleaned. I appreciate this isn’t the hotels fault but something to be mindful of. The public transport is very good in the city and buses stop a short distance away. Get the 6 or 7 into downtown for 2-75$ each, you do need the correct change. When booking I remember that this hotel came up at a reasonable price compared to many others. I would give it 5 stars if the few points mentioned were addressed but again the staff were so helpful and I would like to thank them.","September 19, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

Room 107 was small but worked for the 2 of us and had a good bed and a good sized bathroom with great water pressure (& Trader Joe shampoo, conditioner and body wash). The towels were replaced and room cleaned each day. It’s a bit far from some main tourist attractions but public transportation and Lyft are easily accessible. Felt perfectly safe even at night.

34,"Stayed in room 115, which sleeps three and is located at the rear of the hotel. Pros: Staff is excellent-knowledgeable, friendly, helpful. Room was quiet (except at dinner time for the restaurant next door, that has a gazebo in the hotels garden). Nicely appointed room with enough room for 3 of us. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash were provided. The price of the room enabled us (on a tight budget) to stay in the city. The neighborhood was great, in that there were many restaurants within walking distance. Cons: Rooms are on the second floor and there is no elevator. Parking is a challenge. We could usually find a spot in the neighborhood, but working around the 2 hour max and street sweeping days was challenging. There are pay parking garages nearby, but they looked expensive. The shower in 115 was small. You will want to bring a shower cap if you don’t want your hair to get wet. And bring your own Charmin if you want better than commercial grade toilet paper.

We had a great time walking up and down this street and trying out a different place to eat. It's also within walking distance of Haight Ashbury, Painted Ladies and buses to get you downtown. This place really has everything we needed for an excellent price, would highly recommend! Thank you to the amazing staff who made our stay that much more pleasant and smooth!","August 9, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

38,"Stayed at The Metro for two nights with my family of five. From my booking, trying to accommodate five people, to giving us exploring/restaurant tips, Shana went up and beyond your normal advice to make sure we enjoyed our first trip to San Francisco. You can tell she really cares about The Metro, it’s guest, and the city. The hotel itself also has a great vibe with its historic charm. I worried about the location not ever traveling to SF, but it ended up being perfect. The lower Haight location gives you that spot when you get up in the morning you have 5-10 cafes or bakery within a 1-2 minute walk. While we enjoyed every part of San Francisco walking around this area (painted ladies and Golden Gate Park) may have been the best part. Love this place!","July 19, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

Most of our time was spent away from the hotel exploring the city so the ammenities were perfect for our needs. Any issues were incredibly minor and immediately remedied by the wonderful staff. We stayed in room 101 at the front of the hotel. Great people watching spot through the beautiful ceiling to floor windows. Comfy beds, extremely clean. Fresh fluffy clean towels everyday. We returned to wine and chocolates in the room along with a super sweet card upon our return from our wedding.Great breakfast, brunch, coffee/tea and lunch spots within close walking distance. The Italian restaurant next door has some of the best pizza around. HUGE thank you to Shayna and the staff for being so helpful with suggestions and directions.

41,"We took a family trip to San Francisco (needed two rooms) and were so happy to find ourselves at the Metro Hotel. The neighborhood was safe and had many amenities including retail, restaurants, and a laundromat in the immediate vicinity. These things made our stay that much easier.The room sizes were efficient without feeling cramped which is what we expected. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfy. One room had a view of the street with bay windows that could be opened for a cool breeze.The service at the Metro was outstanding. It is a family owned and operated hotel which is always appealing to us. Every one of the front desk attendants were friendly and knowledgeable. The owner's daughter was a joy to speak with. She helped us with parking solutions (no parking tickets... yay), restaurant recommendations (tasty), and an idea for getting around the city that was simple and cost-efficient (saw so many great sites).If we return to San Francisco, we would definitely book at the Metro again.","July 2, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

42,"If you want a delightfully authentic San Francisco experience and you don't have unlimited funds, this is by far the best place to stay. That's why many of the guests, like me, stay here every time we come back to San Francisco, which for some of us is our hometown. There's a beautiful garden in back that provides peaceful relaxation. The rooms are very clean and nicely appointed with the sort of very comfortable beds and high quality bedding travelers rarely find except in 4 star or better hotels. The free WiFi is fast. Gorgeous, original art works created by Ted Soulis, the famous San Franciscan whose family still owns the hotel, decorate the walls in the public areas and the rooms. You can ask for and get a very quiet room, yet you are in a lively neighborhood filled with nice cafes, restaurants, bars, and shops. You can get very inexpensive and delicious meals at many nearby restaurants and two excellent delis, Falletti's and Bi-Rite, ideal for anyone who wants fresh local food with no preparation hassle! The attentive desk clerks (on duty 24/7) treat you like a dear friend and can advise you on where to go and the easiest ways to get there. Several popular tourist attractions are within walking distance. Within a few blocks there are many frequent service buses that can take you almost anywhere in The City and to various BART light rail stations. The prices are comparable to -- and usually better than -- those of short term rentals in any reasonably safe areas, and you are never left on your own to deal with problems, the way you are in a short term rental apartment. For those who care about the homeless, you can sleep guilt-free at night knowing you have not contributed to San Francisco's housing crisis by selfishly occupying an apartment that has been taken off the rental market. The Metro makes it very pleasant to do the right thing!","June 27, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

I had mentioned it was my boyfriends 30th birthday in the booking as the reason for our trip and they went out of their way to give him a birthday treat and a birthday card welcoming us to the city and signed from all their staff.

44,"I stayed at The Metro for 3 nights in May 2018, choosing it largely because it was so affordable for San Francisco. Having stayed now, it’s clear this gem of a hotel is incredible value.There was a lot to like about my stay, but the wonderful staff working at the hotel are what made it so enjoyable. Radiating warmth, so friendly, full of advice about San Fran & areas to visit, but also just happily sitting down & chatting with guests to make them feel welcome. They added a lovely personal element that is just lost on many hotels. I would stay there again based on the staff alone.As to the hotel itself, the location to me was ideal. It is out of the main city area, but the Haight Ashbury area is a lot calmer & safer than the city center, & the public transport options so close to the hotel meant you could get anywhere quickly. There are plenty of great restaurant, bar & cafe options nearby, & the hotel is well located for a quick trip to visit some key areas like Golden Gate Park, the Painted Ladies, & the Castro.I stayed in room 201. It looks out on the street but I didn’t find the light or noise too bad. It was a bit of a climb getting to the room as there is no elevator, but the hotel is very clear & up front about this on their site & in email correspondence & it wasn’t a concern for me.The room was a little on the small side, particularly the bathroom. However it was well decorated & attractive, & immaculately clean. The extended bar/table with chairs overlooking the street is a good touch.If you’re mobile & happy to climb stairs to get to your room, I would whole heartedly recommend The Metro. I will definitely be staying again if I get the chance to visit San Fran again in the future.","June 10, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

45,"Pre booked this hotel months ago after reading good reviews on here. At the time of booking there were only a limited number of rooms left, and it showed you online which rooms they had with a description of each. The hotel was in the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco which is the hippy area. The hotel had a large bed and although the room was quite small, it had a wall mounted tv and a large bathroom with full bottles of shampoo conditioner and body wash. There are no lifts in the property so you will have to carry bags up the stairs. We arrived at around 2pm (an hour before official hotel check in) but the receptionist Shanna checked us in straight away and gave us vouchers to get discount on the big bus tour. She also recommended loads of places for us to eat and drink and how to use the public transport. She was so lovely and helpful. Would definitely recommend this hotel to first time tourists like ourselves. ","June 9, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

47,"In my opinion, The #1 Best Boutique Hotel in San Francisco. Located in one of the safest areas of the city, with plenty of busy coffee houses and right over a fantastic Italian restaurant. The owner, Shayna, is a rare person who loves making people feel welcome, as do the staff, Mathew, Angela, Marco, Lori, et al. I loved my stay, appreciate the numerous wonderful paintings by Shayna's father, obviously the fifth member of the ""California Four"" that grace the lobby and rooms. I really enjoyed the triple-pane windows with blinds between the glass, high ceilings, self-dimming lighting controls, Japanese garden, wonderful bed. I would say the quietest hotel room I have ever had in SF. Rooms are small, but so is the price. I observed many guests were returning for their second or third stay, and it is obvious they love the place, too. I will definitely be back. My first choice. ","April 17, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

51,"I stayed at the Metro last week for a vacation I took with my son (9) for spring break. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was friendly and very helpful. I had read the reviews prior to arriving, so was expecting a small room. We stayed in room 202, which is on the 3rd floor with 2 twin beds. There was no elevator, so we had to walk up the stairs (which was fine for us, but just a warning to others). The room was big enough for two people to sleep and store their luggage, and included a TV with a few channels. It reminded me of what a standard European hotel room looks like. The shower was about the size of a broom closet, which worked alright for us but may not work for someone much bigger than me (5'5"" and roughly 150lbs). The shower also had an issue with getting the floor sopping wet and unfortunately the offered rug sucked it up and stayed wet throughout our stay. There were a few issues with stains on the blankets (small black stains, I'm assuming ink of some sort) and there were some hairs in the bathroom that were not from us. Neither of these things bothered me, so I did not tell the hotel about it. I just want to provide an honest and complete review. We faced the street and did not have any issues with noise pollution. The room did have a tendency to feel very stuffy in the afternoons when we returned, but opening the windows and turning the fan on high seemed to work well. I would definitely stay at this location again, it was a great price and super convenient to access public transportation.There are a few reasonable restaurants within walking distance. Takes about 20-30 minutes on the bus to get to the Fisherman's Market.","March 16, 2018","0    The Metro Hotel

53,"Drove in from the valley to have a procedure done at UCSF and needed a comfy place to rest and somewhat close to hospital, before returning home. Couldn’t of picked a better place to stay! All the staff were extremely helpful from the moment I called in to book. They selected a very cozy room for us, and it was immaculate. We woulda never know a family had just stayed for 5 days in that room before us. The first thing you noticed (besides all the amazing art on the walls) was the scent of clean, but not overpowering, which was very ok with me! The beds were so cozy, and the additional heaters in the room were handy to aid in my recovery. Check in was a breeze, where she issued me “real” keys and assisted with my bags up the stairs. Even after a procedure they were easy to climb. The shower came stocked with Trader Joe’s full size, tea tree shampoo/conditioner and body wash, and extra simple amenities were available upon request.. like irons, razors, qtips. The towels smelled fresh, too! Our room had a little bedroom off the main one, Room #110 and I can’t wait to return with my family to this little hotel for fun and more of the best pies from Ragazza pizza, right outside the hotel doors. The evening proprietor even handed us a little map of the convinces on the block! Would been nice to have a little fridge to hold the left overs, but that In no way takes away this hotels charm!

57,"We last visited San Francisco in 2016, and since then hotel prices seem to have gone through the roof! It was whilst searching for something a little cheaper that we came across the San Remo Hotel. It's situated very close to Pier 39, maybe a ten minute walk, so it's perfectly sited for all your SF adventures. Inside, it is probably the quirkiest hotel we've ever visited. The walls are lined with historic pictures and furniture and you could spend a fair while just wandering the corridors looking at these. Some of the rooms are internal, with their windows looking out into the corridor, which is brightly lit by skylights. Ours was at the front of the hotel with a view of the street. It was small but comfortable and clean, with a quiet and efficient ceiling fan and a period sink.There's no ensuite, instead you share toilets and shower or bathrooms with the rest of the floor you are on. This sounds like a downside but in practice there are plenty of them and we never had any problem finding a spare facility when we needed one. In fact, both toilets and showers are quite lovely in their detail, and both supply quality toiletries. Also, at the end of each corridor we found a lay-z-boy massage chair, free to use, which was most welcome after a day cycling over the Golden Gate Bridge!If you are after a budget hotel in SF, you pretty much can't go wrong with this place, so long as you know what to expect.","June 29, 2019","1    San Remo Hotel

But other than that, I think they keep them clean. 2) You have to keep in mind that the rooms are extremely small, they do not have air conditioning and the walls are very thins so if you are a light sleeper this could be a problem for you. 3) Also keep in mind that being an old hotel they do not have an elevator, you need to carry the suitcases up like three floors.

The main issue I had was that there was only one sink on the floor, which led to several backups with people brushing teeth, washing hands, washing face, etc. The location was great for exploring Fisherman's Wharf or walking to Coit Tower. There were several good restaurants around as well. The street was also calm enough to pull up a car quickly to unload. The person at the front desk was friendly and understanding when we were running a few minutes late for our checkout as well. I also appreciated the fresh water and coffee at the front.","April 6, 2019","1    San Remo Hotel

We stayed in one of the smaller rooms without a sink or bathroom, it was clean and cosy, the shared bathroom facilities were great with everything you could need for your stay.

73,"We stayed here for several days, when we 1st arrived, I wanted to kill myself, because I noticed that we'd have to share bathroom and showers. I was like...am I back in college or, even worse...a hostel (granted, I've never stayed at a hostel, so my worries are just in my head. Lol). Then...after a few days in, you get used to everything, greeting other guests in the hallway and on the way to the facilities. The customer service is impeccable too! Very kind and knowledge, of what to do/see/eat, in the area. I believe a staff member lives on-site too, so checking in late isn't too much of a hassle. The downsides:-rooms are tiny, only enough to move around in. Most have individual sinks too.-no tv, but plenty of wall plugs, for electronics/beauty appliances.-walls are THIN. You will hear your next door neighbor's convo, even at regular speaking levels. You will hear many outside sounds too. -parking is several blocks away, at the Safeway grocery store. -there is no valet/luggage person, to help you bring stuff up and down, the several stairs.-nothing for kids/teens to do - like a pool or even lounging area. After a certain time, they will get bored or antsy. -community bathrooms and showers, but like I said earlier, you do get used to it all. The decor is fun and unique. You always run into some fun surprise art piece. They serve plenty of coffee/tea/hot cocoa and CANDY all day, with madeline cookies and brownies, in the morning time.You are within walking distance to The Fisherman's Wharf, a bunch of eateries, grocery stores, little Italy and Chinatown.

We stayed there for two nights during our trip and felt very well taken care of. The decor and atmosphere of the hotel is incredible. It is decorated with such eye for detail - every room is designed differently and in an individual charming way that tells a unique story. The hotel was built in 1906 and it has preserved a lot of its history. It is well worth walking around the inside and taking in its unique charme and atmosphere. There is free coffee, tea and pastries in the morning, and one of my personal favorites were the massage chairs that are free of charge and a perfect way to unwind after a long day of sightseeing! The staff is very attentive and was really helpful (i had an issue with my return flight and they helped my call the airline and sort it out for me). Make sure to check out the downstairs restaurant too! The pasta is great and it has a cozy atmosphere. All in all, an absolute wonderful stay!

78,"My sister and I spent one night in San Remo to take in the sights of San Francisco en route to Phoenix. We were a bit apprehensive as it was our first time staying in an hotel with shared bathroom and shower. Well ..we needn't have worried!!! There were so many showers and so many toilets on each floor ..but not only that! there were beautifully decorated little alcoves with hand painted sinks providing mouthwash dispensers and cleansing pads, cotton buds etc and soft towels and face cloths. Something interesting to look at or read around every corner. Our bedroom was reminiscent of my granny's that enveloped you with comfort and warmth and having a peek into other rooms they all seem to be individually decorated. There is tea and coffee and snacks available 24 hours. There is even a laundry room. Every member of staff we encountered was so nice and helpful ..especially Aaren who I had been dealing with while booking. She even gave us lovely little momentos of the hotel when we were leaving. The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing as you can walk to all the interesting places. If you are looking for your typical modern cloned bedroom that you will find in every hotel in the world ...then this is not for you.

80,"The hotel is a very budget friendly hotel for where you are located in the city. It’s excellently located beside The wharf, Chinatown, and main downtown area. The hotel property and area is safe. It’s a good location to get to the pier should you wish to take the ferry. Good restaurants near by as well. The hotel is kind of like a hostel for adults just cleaner and quiet. It’s quaint and vintage and has an old world charm. The showers are outside of the room but there are plenty washrooms and showers and they were clean. So you would not have to wait to shower.One thing I would recommend is to bring a laptop or tablet as they do not have a tv in the room. For me that was one thing I didn’t really like. There were few days it rained and we had to stay in and there was nothing to do. It’s a good hotel if you want to simply lay your head at night, but a TV would have been really helpful. The other tip is that there is carpet in the rooms and if you have allergies it may bother you. I would also recommend having some fresh fruit in the front lobby area in combination with the sweet candies. The water, coffee and tea was nice to have after a long day.","February 5, 2019","1    San Remo Hotel

It is located in a nice place, just few blocks (5-7 min walk) away from Fisherman's Wharf. Rooms were quite small and there was no AC. Our room particularly had no window as well, so we had to open the ventilators which made it very noisy from the people in the corridor. They have nice refreshments near the reception.

Staff were always friendly and helpful, even offering to help us schlep our big box of wine down to our ride to the airport. We appreciated the coffee and water and sweet treats near the reception desk. Although the rooms were tight, we found the beds comfy, the hotel clean, guests quiet and friendly, and there was plenty of conversation starters based on the framed posters, pictures and art work in the hallways. The shared bathrooms and showers were not a problem. Enjoyed the nice Italian restaurant on the ground floor.

My wife said that's because it's like staying at someone's house.Built in 1906, the decor seems largely original. Electric lighting and power outlets have been added but no a/c, T.V., or elevators.3 blocks from the Embarcadero, you shouldn't expect cheap. Our price was higher than Google advertised and does not include $20/night parking garage. Our room (#1) has a full bed and a sink. Toilets, showers, and a tub are down the hall. That may be off-putting to some but it's easy to make an argument against a toilet in your bedroom. Being 1 floor above the street, we had to deal with outside noise but most rooms don't have windows to the outside.I was reluctant to stay here but I'm glad we did.

93,"I absolutely loved my four night stay at the San Remo Hotel. It is a strange building, built to house construction workers after the 1906 earthquake, which means that there are many small bedrooms leading off the corridor and its spurs, and some of those bedrooms have internal windows only (though natural light does come in from skylights to most). The showers and toilets are shared, though were immaculately clean. Therefore, this hotel will not be for everyone - it is certainly not a bland corporate hotel. However, I thought it was brilliant. Though the rooms are quite small (not as small as some reviewers would have you believe), they are individually themed and furnished with care, giving the place an 'old world' feel. The beds have blankets and quilts, rather than a standard issue duvet, meaning temperature control at night is easy. The corridors are lined with interesting things - posters for old movies, old photographs, maps, 1900s furniture, an old writing desk, a massage chair (free to use), and a host of house plants. There is free coffee, water and various hot drink materials with brownies or madeleines next to reception. The staff are extremely helpful and uniformly friendly. The very nature of the place means that it can be a little noisy - but earplugs are provided in each room, and these are the most comfortable earplugs I have come across. Certainly, with one earplug on the side I don't sleep on meant that my sleep was uninterrupted by noise. Top tip: if you are able to book a room with a window and a sink, do - but if those are all gone, I would stay in the San Remo anyway.","October 15, 2018","1    San Remo Hotel

97,"Everything was fine. It's an inexpensive hotel in a nice part of town that is suitable for people who only intend to be in their hotel to sleep and shower. The rooms are tiny and the bathrooms and showers are shared but private when you use them. Sinks for shaving, brushing your teeth and washing your hands are not private, however, and are in the middle of hallways so when you pop out of your hotel room, you may see things you'd rather not see. The paper towel dispenser sticks out pretty from the wall in the hallway and I clocked my shoulder on it pretty good; I'd say it is in a dangerous spot. Many doors are on angles; I slammed my finger on a door when casually closing a bathroom door because the hinge was on one wall but the latch was at an angle on another wall and I was not paying attention to that.Internet access was very good.When I booked an airport shuttle at the front desk, I intended to book the shuttle advertised in the hotel's binder in our room. I had to pay the front desk a deposit for the shuttle and pay the driver the rest. The lady at the front desk told me, though, that the shuttle service listed in the hotel book was no more, and they had another service they booked with, ""at the same price in the book."" Yet I was book for a $17 shuttle, rather than the $14 in the book. I was told that they just hadn't gotten around to updating the book. However, I suspect that they just didn't want to list the name of the new shuttle company in their book so no one could research it before booking at the front desk. It's American Airporter Shuttle and it has one of the worst ratings I've ever seen on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately I trusted the lady at the hotel desk. The shuttle was half and hour late, the van was rickety and I was lied to about pickup times by the shuttle service. I was half an hour late getting to the airport. The hotel gets a cut of this serve and in no way should they be recommending this shuttle company. If their being shady in one area, they're probably being shady in others.Caveat emptor.","September 23, 2018","1    San Remo Hotel

It's characterful, like staying at an eccentric Aunt who hasn't modernized her appt but it's in the best part of town, spotlessly clean and you have great memories of the place. I suppose the question is can you cope with a bathroom down the hall and as a consequence gave to see the other residents in various stages of undress. Actually it's fine and adds to the experience. The location is why you stay here, about 5 minutes from fisherman's wharf. There are great eateries all around and a trader Joe's down the block.

103,Charming hotell with chared toilets/showers. We had a twin bed room. The rooms is quite small and there is almost not place for two big bags together with two persons. We were on the second floor and heard nothing at all from the outside. Most noise was from people talking in the corridor outside the rooms. Free coffee and the was avaulable in the lobby. There is no elevator and all rooms is at least in floor up. Alcatraz Cruises and Fishermans Wharf is under 15 munutes walk. The hotel is very charming and I will probably stay here again if returning to San Francisco. ,"July 28, 2018","1    San Remo Hotel

The small corridors and rooms, filled with plants, antiques and baseball items are very interesting. There is so much to see. The shared bathrooms are clean and have many amenities. We hardly saw any other hotel guests so don’t worry about waiting lines for the bathroom or running out of hot water. It is not a campground.Although I read in other reviews that the hotel was noisy, we did not experience that. On walking distance of the hotel you can get breakfast. The location of the hotel is wonderful, within minutes you walk to the waterfront.","July 27, 2018","1    San Remo Hotel

106,I recently stayed at the San Remo Hotel for 3 nights on my first visit to San Francisco. I couldn't have chosen a better location. I could walk to loads places around the wharf and I enjoyed the neighbouring eatery for Mexican food most nights. My room was cute. Smallish but completely fine and standards were very high for cleanliness. The help-yourself bar for hot and cold drinks was a nice addition and staff were great.

107,"5 stars for the price and location. The narrow corridors are nicely decorated, and the rooms aren't as small as many here suggest, with room to maneuver around the bed and space underneath or on the wardrobe for your cases. Having a sink in the room is a bonus, although that costs extra, and we rarely encountered full showers or toilets. If you did, you moved down the corridor to the other ones. It was good having free coffee throughout the day, although it didn't appear until around 7:45, which was later than we'd prefer. There are a couple of supermarkets within 2 or 3 blocks and quite a few cafes and restaurants nearby. Walking up to much busier Washington Square to eat out only takes 10 minutes or so. Same for Fisherman's Wharf. Even walking to Union Square only took around 35 minutes. Highly recommended, if you can cope with a separate bathroom. ","July 9, 2018","1    San Remo Hotel

Breakfast was a substantial help yourself affair and the 4pm wine and cheese serving was a nice touch. The neighbourhood seems to be safe area with no local bars or restaurants but a 15 minute walk will bring you to a decent choice of eateries and drinking holes. The property is a fair way from downtown San Fransisco but only a cheap 20 minute bus ride to the harbour and pier 39, and the Painted Ladies are 5 minutes away.

111,"This was our second hotel whilst on a two week trip to SF. I booked this based on reviews, location and the style. Upon arriving, we were met by David, who was an exceptional host for our relatively short stay. He helped us with our luggage, showed us around the beautiful hotel, and was incredibly patient in answering a million and one questions we had about the area, and places to go while in SF. We stayed in the Mark Twain suite, which was stunning. Almost large enough to get lost in, the rooms were beautifully decorated, and it felt like going back in time (while still having all the modern luxuries). We had no complaints at all here.During the week, a simple continental style breakfast is served, this includes fruit, cereals, cold meats and cheeses etc. This was more than enough for us, and it was a nice place to sit while chatting to other guests and sharing stories from the previous day. At the weekend, they offer a more substantial cooked breakfast. The location is fantastic, just a couple of blocks from Alamo Square. There's an easy bus service (no 5) to the downtown area too.We really had no complaints or issues at all, and if and when we return to SF, we will definitely come back again.Thank for for the memories!!","September 25, 2018","2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast

It feels like they are still here with you :) The breakfast is outstanding, rooms are very comfortable. Most have private baths, but I made a last minute reservation and could only get one of the rooms on the upper floor with a shared bath. It turned out not to be a problem at all, since there is a bathroom on the main floor available to all guests. It is just a block from the Painted Ladies and Alamo Square Park and an easy walk to Japan town and also to several UCSF medical buildings.

The rooms downstairs are beautifully decorated and are like a haven from the crazy world outside, and it is crazy outside. There are only 9 rooms which makes it more personal. The staff do everything to try and help, providing coffee or just chatting about the area. All staff were friendly. The happy hour is just fantastic with wine, cheese and biscuits located in the lovely historic room downstairs. Breakfast is available and most people sit together at a big table. Sunday they offer a special breakfast with champagne. We had the room at the top so would not recommend for people with mobility issues as there is no lift. I believe there are rooms downstairs as well. Room was lovely bed a bit small and shared bathroom outside which is not an issue. It was a bit of our town near Alamo Sq but there is a vibrant area nearby and it is pretty easy to get into the city by catching the bus at the top of the block.

117,"This is a gorgeous Victorian near Alamo Square that just popped out on an Expedia search. It's an amazing looking, ornate house on Steiner Street just steps from the Painted Ladies and a short walk to the San Francisco City Hall/Asian Art Museum area. The nearest BART stop is Civic Center which is about a mile away, so could be considered a bit of a hike for some. We usually didn't find this to be a problem.We stayed in the Joaquin Miller room, which is one of the smaller rooms on the third floor. The bed in there was only a double or full so we were a bit cozy but it was otherwise very comfortable. Some rooms have a private bathroom but ours was shared, which was a (very) slight inconvenience, but also one we were aware up when we booked. The claw-foot tub is cool looking but takes a little maneuvering to not get water on the floor. We did some laundry in the bathtub and hung it up to dry in the room.During the week they provide a continental breakfast buffet (coffee/tea, assorted bread and jam, meat, and cheese). On the weekend they'll cook you a hot breakfast from 9-11, which was quite delicious. Once day was French toast with fresh fruit and the other was quiche and a salad. The option of champagne/orange juice/mimosas was also provided with the hot breakfast. They also provide wine and cheese in the parlor from 4-6 every day. We usually missed this since we were out but it was a welcome treat the day we arrived.I was unable to get a decent WiFi signal in my room to save my life (tried all 3 available networks), however my wife didn't have this problem and she was right next to me, so it may have been a problem with my computer that I was just too lazy to solve at the time.Overall, a really cool place and we'd love to stay here again, and maybe check out of the bigger rooms.","March 29, 2018","2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast

The building itself is amazing and if you are looking for a boutique hotel that is also quirky and in an excellent location then look no further. Close to excellent bus links and within easy walking distance of many local attractions it is a bonus to be outside of the busy Union Square district. The hosts were welcoming, very helpful and generous with their time and gave us plenty of information. Staying at the Chateau was like having the luxury of a hotel but also the freedom of being in your own home - being able to sit in the parlour and read, have a glass of wine or even order a takeaway!

124,"I've been staying at the Chateau Tivoli for 12 years. As a music and movie lover I find it perfectly situated to easily get to multiple venues and theaters. With no two night minimum like many BnBs I generally come in just for the night of a show. It's just blocks from the Independent and the historic Fillmore auditorium. A quick bus or taxi ride gets you to the Opera, the Rickshaw Stop, the Regency or Warfield. Really, this neighborhood couldn't be more centrally located. Staying at the Tivoli and strolling to Divisadero street or Hayes valley feels like staying in a lively European town. There's an abundance of excellent restaurants on Divisadero street and there seems to be several new ones every time I visit. During my last visit around the holidays I found an excellent new greek place and a new ice cream shop!I've stayed in many of the rooms at the Tivoli and find that they each have a unique and distinct charm. I splurged on the Mark Twain Suite once and have to say that would be my favorite but I most often prefer to stay in the Isadora Duncan room. Even though the bathroom is across the hall, it is private and huge! It has what looks to be the original tile and a claw foot tub. The room itself is very comfortable and although it's right off the street it is very quiet and peaceful. I've taken the most excellent daytime naps in there.The Innkeepers are not just nice but extremely helpful, some of their tips have saved me quite a bit of grief when trying to navigate San Francisco. As familiar as I am with SF I have found when you're unaware of events or conferences you can find yourself unpleasantly surprised in a city that likes to keep things interesting. The breakfasts here are very well thought out, the term 'continental' is misleading for their weekday breakfasts since they put out such a large variety of items you won't feel anything lacking. The weekend brunches have always been excellent even though I rarely stick around for them. The smell of french toast as I check out always lifts my spirits.

137,"We stayed for 4 night, 2 of them were in the Joaquin Miller room with the shared bathroom and 2 in Enrique Caruso with a private bathroom. If you are going to book a shared bathroom room, I suggest booking the one we stayed in, the other one (I think called Jack London) is right next to the toilet, so we walked past their room every time we needed the bathroom. It's an old house, you can hear everything. I preferred our first room to our second as it was cosier. I think that a big improvement they could make is to the breakfast offering, it's just quite poor compared to other places we have stayed at. There is lots of sugary cereal, toast, sweet breads, sweet yoghurt and even the ham was sweet probably from a glaze. Ok, so it's not to our tastes but even so having a huge hit of sugar to start the day is not good for anyone. There is some fruit but not enough. I suggest having a large fruit bowl, some boiled eggs, some healthier cereal and that would vastly improve things. I actually bought my own cereal from Whole Foods and only ate that in the end. Cheese and wine is served between 4-6pm which is great. The house has great character, it was a very cosy stay and the staff were very helpful. If they had a knock out breakfast this place would have been perfect. ","November 15, 2015","2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast

138,"My friend and I recently spent 5 nights here on our U.S. trip. We chose the 2 bedroom apartment in the basement and loved it. Staying here was like going back in time, living in the grandeur and luxury of yesteryear was wonderful. Of course with the home being hundreds of years old, there were floorboards creeking and some noises from plumbing from time to time. This was not an issue for us however. Nicholas and Meredith were lovely and made sure our stay was a pleasant one. We loved returning to the Chateau after a busy day and enjoying happy hour. This was daily from 4-6pm. A selection of wines and cheeses were on offer, a perfect way to relax and chat with other guests. We felt really at home during our stay, having run of the house and being able to enjoy all that was on offer was fabulous. Breakfast was lovely....selections of fresh fruit, bagels, breads, cold cuts, cheeses, smoked salmon and cereals were available. I would definitely stay here again.","November 11, 2015","2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast

We stayed in a fairly large room with 3 windows on the third floor for 1 night. We couldn't get wifi in that room, but that was not an issue for us, and I expect wifi worked in the rooms downstairs.

Not to mention the champagne.The afternoon wine & cheese is nice, although not as social as some I've seen at B&Bs - that is a question of the clientele, not the staff as far as I can see.Big disadvantage here is parking - it's all street and will be requiring a visitor permit at some point later in 2015.

151,"Basically, if they've availability, book it. We stayed just two nights and wished we could have stayed longer. We stayed in the Isadora Duncan room which had it's own private bathroom across the corridor. Which almost put us off making the booking but in fact it was more than fine, the bathroom was huge and very tastefully decorated. It was literally three steps from our room.The room was on the first floor and overlooked Steiner Street. The bed was comfortable and huge. All the furnishings were very high quality and sympathetic to this historical mansion. The room had very tall ceilings and had some lovely artwork. The rooms have no minibar or television in keeping with the style of the accommodation.The parlour, where cheese and wine were served every afternoon was a delight, with comfortable period furniture, a piano, interesting ornamentation and a vintage valve radio playing classical music. The parlour leads onto the dining room where breakfast was served at a communal table and also at a table for two. It's a continental breakfast and is very good. You can also use the kitchen which is out back behind the dining room. If you want to cook or keep things cold in the fridge.Staying in an historical mansion was a unique experience for us and was one of the highlights of our holiday.Parking is quite hard to come by if you arrive in the afternoon, we had to park three blocks away. However it's free. Also, we we warned by a member of staff not to walk through a nearby block close by. Think it was Filmore Street. That freaked us out a bit. We felt safe in the immediate neighbourhood though and used public transport without any bother.Chateau Tivoli is not central, but their is a bus stop nearby and the Haight neighbourhood was in walking distance. We walked back one afternoon from the city centre and it was a leisurely one hour stroll.All in all we had a fantastic experience.","November 8, 2014","2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast

155,"We spent 5 days in the Lily Langtree suite and could not have found a more delightful place to stay in San Francisco.The Chateau is beautiful, quirky, classy and full of character. The decor is fits the era and the whole feel is calm and dignified.Our suite was advertised as being ""in the basement"", but with the hilly nature of the area, we had windows at street level and our own private door onto the street.Even though the word ""suite"" was used when we booked, we expected, for the reasonable price we paid, to get a room and possibly a hallway, but we ended up with two bedrooms and two hallways !The continental breakfasts were great and there was complimentary cheese and wine laid out in the reception rooms every afternoon - with the antique radiogram tuned to the classical station. We did not stay long enough to sample the weekend champagne breakfasts, sadly.The B&B is near Alamo Square and the (now dull pastel) Painted Ladies. The #5 bus passes by regularly a half a block away and goes to town (Market Street) one way and the Botanical Gardens and Ocean View beach the other way. Fillmore and its restuarants and jazz is a short walk down the hill and Divisadero street with its shops and coffee bars is a walk of several quite steep blocks the other way.The Chateau has free wi-fi, though the signal is only strong in the reception rooms. We could get a signal from our toilet ! But there are plenty of chairs, tables and settees to settle into in the sitting room upstairs - with a glass of good wine if you choose your time right.On top of all this - the staff were wonderful. Friendly, helpful, chatty, kind, full of suggestions.... They made the stay that much more special. Thank you Meredith and Nick.Beware. There are no TV's in the B&B. There suggestion is that if you need to be entertained, they have board games and plenty of books to read. Somehow this made things even more specially and classy and got us out and about more than we might have done normally.Top tip for San Francisco if you don't have a car: Buy a visitor pass for the Muni transport.You pay $3 for a Clipper card and then load it with either a 1-day, 3-day or 7-day pass. This means you can travel on all the buses, trams and trolleys, whenever you like. It does not cover the BART (underground) however, but we never found the need to use this anyway.","August 14, 2014","2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast

Only problem I found with room was lack of power sockets near bed, but I guess that comes with and older building. Sharing the bathroom with the room next door was never an issue, and if we were desperate there was a bathroom available on the main level. The bathroom was nice and there was plenty of shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc. Bathtub has a handheld shower head but I found I was too tall and had to kneel in the bath to wash my hair! Third floor staircase is skinny and it was a little hard dragging our luggage up there.Staff were so friendly and helpful.

159,"Chateau Tivoli is a boutique hotel / guesthouse in San Francisco. The building, its interior, its decoration scream original period detail. The hotel has modern creature comforts such as wifi and en-suite bathrooms, but other than that you feel blissfully transported back to another era.It is a period building, so there is no double glazing and no air conditioning (i.e. expect some noise from the street, but not enough to disturb your sleep).Breakfast is served at a large shared dining table, with only one table for two in the window bay. Therefore you need to be able to put on a ""morning face"" and chat with your fellow guests over breakfast (this will either be your heaven or your hell, depending on your personal taste). The breakfast menu is simple but delicious. Expect bucks fizz with breakfast on Sunday mornings.Complimentary cheese and wine are served mid-afternoon, and the selection is generous.The staff are helpful and friendly, but discrete and not in your face.We enjoyed our stay here, and would happily stay there again.

She also prepares and serves outstanding breakfasts (the recent review complaining about the quality of the weekday breakfast leaves me baffled!).Chateau Tivoli's location was ideal for our two-wheeled exploration of the remarkable neighborhoods and architecture in what is surely one of the two or three most iconic of all American cities--a place quite easy ""to leave your heart in"" and one to which we hope to return again in the near future.","April 30, 2014","2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast

181,"The access to Cow Hollow is very easy off Lombard street. There is a direct turn into parking garage off Lombard, and another off Steiner St. The garage was very clean with access to the office and elevators. The office staff were very pleasant and we were allowed into our room 2 hours early! Most places will not do this. Our room was fine and very clean. The bathroom has a lot of space and counter space for toiletries. There is a heater, in the ceiling, for after shower chills. The closet was ample and there is a room safe which we used (very convenient). We were facing Lombard St. As other reviewers have discussed, it was noisy. And, another reviewer was correct that there are rooms facing off the main drag but with an additional fee of $10. I think you have to put this in perspective. Hotels sometimes charge more for a pool view or an ocean view or how high up your room is. This is no different. And, I feel badly that someone smeared the staff. They were great! If you want more quiet, pay the $10. The room is already a bargain by SF standards and a good one at that. If not, bring your eye mask and ear plugs and turn your phone on white noise and I bet you would be ok. The area, around the hotel is very safe and walkable to all kinds of restaurants, shops and bars. I had not explored this area before.

182,"Beware of the bait and switch! On our first visit to the Cow Hollow Inn we were given a room was facing Lombard Street. For those who are not familiar with San Francisco, Lombard aka U.S. 101 which goes through town and over the Golden Gate Bridge and is one of the busier thoroughfares in the city. If your room is on Lombard you will hear a pretty constant stream of car and truck traffic. The hotel is nothing fancy, but more expensive than a similar two star hotel in other cities. Remember it is San Francisco! Our kids live a few blocks from the hotel so it is convenient. On our second visit to the cow Hollow Inn, I noticed a couple of things on the website when I was making my reservation. They offer, Standard, Deluxe and Superior rooms with relative increasing rates. Typically this means bigger rooms, maybe a sofa etc. Links to the room descriptions were broken. I got that 404 error message. I was content with the standard room price. They also had a drop down list of requests. For example you could ask for a room on the 1st, Floor, 2nd Floor, 3rd Floor, ""Back Room If Possible"", Crib, Early Arrival, Extra Pillow, Foam Pillow… etc. Oh yea refrigerator $5.00 per day. I thought that was nice so I requested a back room and foam pillow.On the day before we were to arrive I received a call from the hotel confirming my reservation, acknowledging that I had requested a back room. They mentioned that I had selected a standard room and that the back rooms are deluxe or better so if I wanted a back room away from Lombard, it would be $10 more per day.I told them I was confused because the website did not indicate a surcharge for a back room request, nor a surcharge for any other request except if I wanted a refrigerator. I told them that I found their request offensive and that it seemed like a shake down for more money. I ask them to grant my request for a back room (they already indicated it was possible) and that I should not be charged. They said that they could not honor this request, but they would pass on my concern to the owners. When I checked in the next day we were located in a room facing Lombard and no foam pillow. I am one of those foolish people that does not like to complain all the time on small issues so I did not. At the same respect I do not like to take be taken advantage of either.. The hotel was clean, but had an antiseptic smell in the halls…sort of like a hospital. The house keeping staff was efficient and the room was cleaned promptly, though low grade shampoo and conditioner.It is not much money, but probably an indication of the owners mindset. I am choosing to vote with my dollars and will be selecting another hotel for our next visit to the kids.If you must stay at the Cow Hollow Inn, beware of the noise on Lombard and the sneaky front desk staff looking to up-charge you for a simple request.

Easy to get to the Fisherman's Wharf area, as well as other sites we wanted to see.Finally, the reservation person (we booked directly with Cow Hollow) and Check-In Desk folks were friendly and helpful.Just remember, San Francisco is an expensive hotel market. Cow Hollow Inn & Suites, while not low budget, was very fairly priced. You can't go wrong with this property.Only two suggestions: Main A/C Unit is in Living Room, so the two Bedrooms could use Fans; and,don't go to Mel's Diner (across the street) it's terrible.","February 12, 2019","3    Cow Hollow Inn and Suites

186,"My husband and I have been staying at this hotel a lot over the last five years. Medical needs have made it necessary to stay two or three days at least every three months. I have ALS and can no longer speak and it is difficult to walk. Because of that I always ask for a certain room close to the elevator. This time when we checked in we were given a different room. I wrote a note to the person helping me and was then scolded for thinking that we could always have that room. We accepted a different room and upon checking in thought it was fine. I unpacked our clothes and set up the equipment for a feeding tube. Finally put on my robe and I had stockings on. It was then that we realized that the carpet was wet! My socks were soaked! I wrote an email expressing our dismay with the situation. This was at 3:30. No response at all. The next morning I see where this woman responded at 11:00 last night. Again, spent most of her time scolding over the room number although in my note, I said the room was fine, it was the wet carpet that was the problem. We had a choice...we could get a king bed on a noisy street or two double beds. Nothing whatsoever to apologize for our wet floor! We will not stay here again. The woman, Irene, could have cared less that I am handicapped and could not speak to explain our issues.

We usually ask for a room off Lombard, but this visit for some reason the outside noise was more noticeable this time, it sounded like our room was just above a bar. Unfortunately this time we left behind a bag of items, containing about $100 worth of items. It was a gift given to us by a family friend and we inadvertently left it sitting on the dresser. We realized the next morning as we were unpacking we had left the bag at the hotel. I called the hotel and the hotel receptionist said the items were not turned in by hotel staff and she said they were more than likely thrown out. The hotel receptionist said she would contact the staff member who had cleaned our room that day and get back to us. We never heard back. It’s hard to believe our bag of items had been thrown out as the times were all unopened. Sad to think we would have been better off leaving the bag in our car in the hotel garage!

194,"We arrived in SF on 4 October 2018; being the final part of our trip having previously visited Vegas and San Diego. We took the Bart from the airport (the machines to buy the tickets are very confusing and looked to be set up so ou would overpay) to embarcadero as recommended on this very site and got a taxi to the hotel after eventually finding the right entrance from the station. Overall cost was $35 for the two of us. The room wasn't ready until 4 o clock but we could leave our bags in a secure room. We were in room 333 which as requested on booking directly was on the top floor at the back of the hotel. The room was lovely, very comfortable, had a view of golden gate bridge and had a coffee machine. The hotel is in a fantastic position with lots of bars and restaurants on chestnut st or union st. We had breakfast at Noahs' bagels which was really good and highly recommended. Fisherman's wharf is in walking distance though we generally used the number 30 bus which goes there and then onto union square (We got a weekly pass for $37 which was an absolute bargain as you can also use it on the cable cars which are $7a trip alone). Only thing to watch out with the number 30 bus is that the 30x doesn't go to union square and the 30s on the way back only goes as far as van Ness. The hotel offered a shuttle to the airport for $17 each but this picks up at other hotels and we were told to allow two hours for the journey so got an uber ($55) instead. Would definitely stay at this hotel if we ever returned to the best city we have ever been to in the USA.","October 28, 2018","3    Cow Hollow Inn and Suites

Then there are out-of-the way places that are, in fact, really good, both in quality and location. Cow Hollow Inn and Suites is one of them. Actually it's in a very lively part of the city - near Union Street and Chestnut Street, both destinations for locals search for life and food. It's also a short walk from Fort Mason. Lombard Street leads straight to the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, so it gets a lot of traffic. We stayed here because we didn't want to pay $1000 per night in the middle of town during a major convention. It was a great decision. Cow Hollow is very comfortable and has great staff. If you have a car (we didn't) it also as terrific parking. Lots of restaurants nearby and the city itself is just an Uber away. If you like quiet, it is best to pay a bit extra for an inside room.

198,"I booked online at Booking.com, and immediately after realized I didn't actually need the room, as friends were able to put us up. I called right away and asked if they could please make an exception to their online booking no-cancellation policy, as I had made a mistake. The desk receptionist said I would have to wait for the manager, who wouldn't be back until the next day. The manager was adamant that she would not make an exception, insisting that I could only change the date and not cancel. I explained that I wouldn't need the room on any other date because we were moving to the area. She said that was all she was willing to do, as there was a no cancellation policy. No cancellation policies exist so there won't be last-minute cancellations where you can't fill the room - I called immediately, so this is just her insisting on keeping the $300 for a booking I couldn't even keep. So we kept the room, even though we didn't need it, and since we were both laid up with the flu, we stayed with our friends instead of checking into the hotel that night. I just checked my credit card statement and there's an inexplicable $8.00 charge from this hotel. For what? Why? Why would they do that? It's not the amount of money that matters but they already HAD $300 I could ill afford and now they charge me $8 for no reason at all? We weren't even THERE, what could we possibly have done to merit a charge? I called to ask what the charge was for and the receptionist said he didn't know, he'd have to ask the manager. OH GOOD can't wait to deal with that penny-pinching jerk again, can't wait to hear why she charged me $8 in addition to the $300 I paid for a room she probably went ahead and rented to someone else so she could double her money. Their hold music, by the way, promises a ""friendly and accommodating"" staff. They've been anything but friendly and accommodating. They've been useless without this manager and the manager has been a straight-up epithet.

207,"We considered multiple TripAdvisor reviews and activity mapping when considering lodging options for our five day trip to San Francisco. Our overarching goal was to find a hotel which was centralized between our scheduled activities and our oldest son's home. We found the Cow Hollow Inn and Suites to be in the perfect location.We found the hotel staff to be extremely professional and courteous during our stay. The manager's recommendations for breakfast and lunch were outstanding and greatly appreciated. We used the rental car very little and having the garage made for a safe parking location.The hotel may be a bit outdated but it was very comfortable and the room was spacious. We visited the Blue Barn, Home Plate and Pete's Coffee & Tea which were each fantastic and literally only steps away. Plenty of high end shopping one block away which was very much enjoyed by certain members of the family. NOTE: This is an expensive trip so plan accordingly!Pack your sneakers! The best way to see the sights are on foot if you are able to do so - we walked to Crissy Field multiple times per day, to the base of the Golden Gate Bridge and to Fisherman's Wharf. We put on plenty of walking mileage during the trip - we also traveled the PCH by car and used Uber for an early morning departure to the Alcatraz Ferry.We will absolutely be returning to Cow Hollow Inn and Suites summer 2019!","August 14, 2018","3    Cow Hollow Inn and Suites

Lots of nice service when I checked in, but then they leave you alone. I am not the sort who loves talking to strangers over breakfast, so their parlor style, with a variety of table shapes and sizes suited me. The resident cat Pip charmed me each morning as he sat in a chair and stared my coffee and me.

221,I had a semi-business/pleasure trip planned for San Francisco. Golden Gate Hotel was the best location for both. The light rail (BART) has direct connections from San Francisco Airport. It dropped me and my wheeled suitcase at Powell and Market and a slow walk up hill had me arriving at the hotel in good time.For the solo or group traveler there are several nearby restaurants to either get food to go or to sit and eat. The Asian Museum was only a 10-15 minute walk. Grace Cathedral is just 3 blocks away. (Very steep but doable if you're patient enough to walk slowly.) In addition to religious services there are concerts on Sundays.China town is several short blocks down hill.A continental breakfast of tea and coffee along with a basket of baked goods and OJ are served each morning. Tea and cookies are served at 4 PM. I have been here before and always have an opportunity to chat with fellow travelers from all over the world.,"April 18, 2019","4    Golden Gate Hotel

We had a room with a shower, sink and a shared toilet which we coped with very well.

We also had a rental car with us, even though we didn't use it around the city, and the hotel offers a discount at the parking garage directly across the street for $30/day, which is a great find in the city if you must park.

231,"The Golden Gate Hotel it's a small Hotel with minimalist features, an almost non-existent lobby, and a very small dining area that seats about 12 people comfortably. That being said , it reminds me of some of the smaller hotels I've stayed in places like Paris and the outskirts of Rome. If you are looking for a Westin or a Hilton this is not the place. If you're looking for a place with some character and charm at a reasonable price then this is the place.On the inside it's clearly a B&B Style Hotel comma the rooms are a little bit dated but not didn't you or dirty .. more like something you would find in the berkshires of Massachusetts then the tourist district of San Francisco .. especially the cat that has free roam of the lobby area and stairs and hallways and the owners quartersYou should make sure to review their website carefully, there are some rooms with shared bathrooms so if that's not your thing make sure to read the details of your reservation. The breakfast is minimal but adequate to get your day started and the people are so pleasant. If you want a full breakfast there are plenty of places nearby at very reasonable prices. I know this might not sound like the greatest review but finding a location like this in San Francisco is really quite a find if you're open to a place that feels like you're staying at your grandparents house comma I know I will be back again.","October 10, 2018","4    Golden Gate Hotel

242,"We stayed for two nights and were so lucky to find this place as there was a huge conference of 180,000 additional people in San Francisco. All the positives by other reviewers are true, it's charming, friendly, has a great breakfast & comfortable beds. It's not noisy though .. not sure where that's come from. Yes you have to share bathrooms but it wasn't a problem and the big fluffy robes are lovely. The place is spotless and staff were so friendly. It's also cross the street from a car hire place which was amazing as we just moved our luggage easily to hire our car. I'd definitely recommend it. The area is great, near to Union Sq, the metro and not too far from the Pier area.","December 5, 2017","4    Golden Gate Hotel

Parking is conveniently located across the street at a discounted rate of $30/day for hotel guests. The mattress was a bit firm for our taste, but the room was well appointed in the Victorian style. We lucked out and got a free upgraded on our room and the manager was super flexible on a late check-out.

245,"Golden Gate is a boutique hotel. Accessing rooms on higher floors requires using a small old elevator. I found it fun and charming. If this is a problem then make sure to ask for ground floor.The hotel is about 1/2 mile from muni stop, nearer to Bart stops, easy walk to both. Steps away from a market and Uncle Vito pizza.The rooms were small. Bed was very comfy and plenty of warm blankets. No fridge or closet in room, just a wardrobe. No air conditioner or fan made it a little stuffy one day.We loved interacting with Pip the house cat. He came up with us one night and was always at breakfast.Prepare to gain weight from the almond or chocolate croissants at breakfast along with muffins and rolls, no hot choices. Spencer told us where to eat and was very helpful. He packed us a go bag of croissants before our early flight so we got fed even on our last day. Spencer helped us store our oversized boxes of wine that didn't get in the elevator. He and the others at Golden Gate were wonderful hosts. I would definitely stay here again.

The hallways have trompe-l'oeuil paintings, frames with old views of San Francisco, cozy-looking desk lamps in the corners, and soft carpets. Riding the the old-fashioned elevator, just opening and closing its double metal gates, was fun. Even the walls of the elevator shafts were painted and made for an enjoyable ride. Breakfast was served by the owners in a small and cozy room by the reception. Some of the tables are for sharing which makes it easy to strike up conversations with other guests. The entrance area was presided over by a dignified-looking cat whose preferred resting place seemed to be the New York Times paper on the desk. He looked like the real owner of the place, with his likeness etched into the glass-door hotel entrance, printed on the bathroom soap wrappers and even the shampoo labels. His presence, the antique decoration and the friendly owners made us feel very much at home. Add to this the excellent location close to Union Square and a cable car line, and right across from a car rental station, and it makes a place to be highly recommended.","July 23, 2017","4    Golden Gate Hotel

258,"This charming place is halfway between a hotel and a bed and breakfast. It reminds me of some places I've stayed in in Europe. It is not for people who want everything big and modern, but it has what we needed. We booked a room with two twin beds and a private bath. The bath included a large clawfoot tub, and this was a major plus for me in a city that invites and requires a lot of walking. There are lots of antique touches, including an amazing cage elevator and something I've never seen before: a toilet with a round tank. There's lots of interesting art throughout the hotel as well. The armoire had a generous number of hangers and the room included two chairs, a couple of tables and a dresser. I was worried that the street-facing room on the third floor would be noisy, and there is definitely traffic noise. But the windows shut out a lot of it, and it quiets down after nine more than I would have expected so close to restaurants and bars, even on Friday and Saturday. I didn't need the earplugs I brought. The staff are friendly and professional and the owners are charming and helpful. Pip the cat is delightful as well. The breakfast is fine; they were able to accommodate us with some gluten free toast. They offer a discount for parking in the garage across the way and it is much less than you will pay anywhere else. There are also two car rental agencies in that garage. We rented a car just for our last day to travel out of the city, and then dropped it off at the airport. You really can't be the price for the location.","March 29, 2017","4    Golden Gate Hotel

We then moved into a room with a private bath, and it was comfortable and quiet. This place goes out of its way to make you feel welcome. If you are traveling for a good length of time, you will be pleased to know a laundromat is next door on one side, and a dry cleaner is on the other.

I arrived at the hotel in the evening, and, as a Titanium Elite Bonvoyer, I was informed that I was having a room upgrade. The person who checked me in was very friendly. I went to the room, on one of the upper floors and was startled as to how small the room was. I know big city hotels mean smaller rooms, but not only was the room small, the bathroom was absolutely tiny. That said, I had a very comfortable sleep in the Marriott bed. The concierge lounge was fine, and it provided the standard Marriott fare. I like that they are not offering bottled water in the concierge lounge. Rather, they have glass bottles and a dispenser of still and sparkling water. It would have been nice if these bottles had lids, but it's good to see them reducing the amount of plastic they use. I was very eager to order some lunch through room service, but surprisingly, they only do room service for breakfast and dinner. I'm not sure why I could not have the turkey club at 2 pm that they are willing to bring me at 5 pm. But everyone I dealt with at the hotel was friendly and courteous. I'm not sure if all of the rooms were this small, but I still stay at this property again.","June 2, 2019","5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square

279,"I'm a very loyal Marriott fan and have stayed at most of the properties in SF and been very happy with them. This isn't one of my favorites, although in fairness the location is handy and the room was updated and large, but there was only a shower. At check in, I wasn't offered my Lifetime Platinum automatic upgrade at check in and I assumed that I received it. My room was low and right over the cable car, which made it extremely noisy from early morning until around midnight. The HVAC fan was so loud, even on the low setting, I had to turn the system off to be able to sleep and was very cold all night long. I was too busy to be able to request a room change as this was a work trip. At check-out I asked if they considered my room an upgrade and the desk clerk said, ""definitely not"" and said I didn't receive one because I checked in online - in response to the two messages I received from Marriott urging me to do so. He said that resulted in my receiving the ""first available"" room instead of the upgrade I was expecting (why the desk clerk didn't ask if I wanted that instead of an upgrade, I don't know). A few months ago I stayed at a different SF Marriott, checked in online and was offered an upgrade at check in. So it seems this is a property issue, and it's bad policy and poor customer service. If these things don't matter to you, this hotel is fine. But for the price, I will choose a different Marriott next time I'm in the city.","June 2, 2019","5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square

280,"Stayed 2 nights due to proximity to conference at another hotel. Further away from union square so not quite as busy, but still convenient to walk to any place. Excellent front desk staff and concierge lounge service. Standard light breakfast and happy hour snacks. Good setup with water fountain and available water bottle that can be taken to room. Hotel wasn’t busy so got upgraded to a junior suite as part of rewards. Excellent spacious room. Recommended. ","May 26, 2019","5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square

281,This is by far the WORST Marriott I have ever stayed. The concierge staff is so RUDE. I never again will stay at this hotel due to customer service and general cleanliness.

282,"I am a big Marriott fan. Usually stay at a JW or the other Marriott (Marquis) while in San Francisco. Marquis is good, but a convention center. I found the service at Union Square to be excellent, all the way from check-in, requests, lounge and check-out. While I am not a regular here, there are apparently many as i watched the door man greet many people by name. Clearly familiar service. As a regular business traveler I really appreciate such things.

Although we had the view the others we were traveling with had equally large rooms but no view. The hotel is on corner of Sutter + Powell so right on the cable car route to Fisherman's Wharf, many nearby restaurants catering to any food preference. Easy walk to the BART on Powell + Market and a block from all the shopping on Union Square. Staff were great. No down side at all.

285,"From check-in through my four-night stay, everything at the Marriott Union Square was just perfect - my new favorite hotel in San Francisco!I arrived a little bit before check-in time, and my new buddy Jeff at the front desk not only arranged to get me into my room early, he tap-tap-tapped away at the keyboard to upgrade me to a lovely corner room, a spacious junior suite-sized room with huge windows on two sides, making the room feel even bigger. (Thanks, Jeff!!!)The layout of these corner rooms is great, with a small entryway (complete with small bar area and fridge). There's a sliding door separating the rest of the room from the rather large bathroom having a floor-to-ceiling window, big sink and vanity, and a nicely sized shower with rainfall shower head. Most impressive was the new décor - this hotel has obviously been renovated recently, having a much more modern feel than the Marriotts of years past. This sense of design extends throughout the hotel, with artwork in the hallways and a small yet nicely furnished lobby. With only 18 rooms on each floor, the hotel has a nice boutique feel to it, very very different than most large city properties with hundreds of rooms. The small size also makes the hotel remarkably quiet, a big plus when it's time to visit slumber-land.Just like Jeff, all of the staff I interacted with here was great, including the kind folks in the Concierge Lounge who made sure we were well-taken care of from breakfast through evening snacks, as well as with helping us use the automated wine dispenser - tap your room key and hit 'pour'! The hotel is also quite eco-friendly, offering bottles that you can fill up with either still or sparkling water and take back to your room. No having to lug bottles of water from CVS or Walgreens here! The lounge has a nice view of Union Square and points south, especially nice in the evening when everything's lit up.I really like the location of this property. Unlike the larger properties south of Market, this hotel is just one block north of Union Square, making it a really good location for doing anything around the Square (including shopping and going to the San Francisco Playhouse, a must-do while in town). It doesn't take long to get to Chinatown, the Financial District, North Beach, or the Ferry Marketplace, and it's a short walk to the Muni/BART stations. (Use Montgomery rather than Powell - a nicer walk.) The Powell Street cablecar line is quite literally at your doorstep, making trips to Fisherman's Wharf (Powell-Mason) and Ghirardelli Square (Powell-Hyde) quite easy... and I have to admit to being like a little kid in the late evenings, looking out the northerly windows of my room to watch the cablecars go by. After my four nights here, this room was hard to say goodbye to, but now that I've discovered this gem of a Marriott right in the center of the action, I know where I'll be bedding down on future trips to San Francisco. My thanks again to Jeff and the entire staff for a wonderful stay!","April 21, 2019","5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square

By far one of the most comfortable beds I’ve had in a hotel. Concierge club had a good selection of snacks throughout the day. Breakfast was standard, but the quality seemed better than most Marriott’s. The entire staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. It was also very safe and access to hotel was monitored.

289,"It was combination business and pleasure trip to San Francisco to celebrate my birthday. We want to stay close to Union Square and picked JW Marriott Union Square Hotel.At the front desk, we were warmly greeted and welcomed to the renovated JW Marriott Hotel. To made this trip extra special, a bottle of wine and selected cheeseboard was delivered that evening to make the visit more festive.Our room 1104 came with two queen beds; large sitting area sofa, bar chair & high table; desk and chair; large 55-inch HDTV screen; and coffee maker. We requested a mini refrigerator (no charge) to hold our toddler food.Our room had gleaming rosewood and cherry finishes. The wallpaper was a shiny dark grey color. The view was on to Mason Street with a great view of the building across the street and its occupants as well as rooftops of other buildings.There were 1-USB port and 2-electric plugs on the 2 bed posts next to night stand, 2-USB and 2-plugs on the clock, 1-USB and 1-plug at desk.The bathroom has spacious area around sink vanity with quartz top, expansive walk-in shower & spray, and beautifully decorated marble tiles on the floor and walls with accent offset running border of quartz, metal, and glass. The water closet is a separate alcove with shiny dark grey wallpaper.The room was very comfortable.There are four elevators and they are super fast. Once inside the elevator, I had a bird's eye view of the entire hotel interior core as the elevator goes flying up to the upper floors. The elevators are super quick and quiet. The central core of the building is well design with guest rooms on the exterior with inside walkway all around. There are no interior rooms, but from the walkway you can look upward to the rooftop where natural light streams into the building and look downward to the lobby & restaurant below. Natural lighting provides a very comfortable atmosphere.The fitness gym is good size with good variety of equipment along with HDTV, towels, earplugs, magazines, hot & cold water dispenser, and fresh apples. There is a separate room with large floor space ideal for group exercises, pilates, yogi, and other activities. The lobby level have their all day dining restaurant along with bar. The lounge area was especially nice since it was on far side of lobby level away from the front desk, restaurant, and bar making it a more intimate setting for sitting & relaxing. There are 3 square tables with seating for 8, one rectangular table and 4 alcoves with seating for 4, and 2 tables for 2. This is an ideal place to work solo or in groups with a quiet atmosphere. In a nutshell:Bed mattress - firm and comfortable Pillow - several pillows per bed & fluffyBathroom - very roomySofa & Chair - comfortable & no sunken spotsElec Outlets/USB ports - 7 outlets & 5 USB portsView - rooftops & building across the streetNatural Lighting - eastern exposureElectrical Lighting - good for relaxing & readingRoom Cleanliness- YesFresh Linens & Towels - YesStaff - very friendly & helpful Public Space - very relaxing and comfortableLocated in Union Square, the hotel is central to many of San Francisco's notable points of interest, including Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, Ghirardelli Square and the Financial District. There is easy access to the cable cars, trolley buses, and motor buses.Early morning or late evening walks are ideal on the steep San Francisco hills to burn those calories. Yet, the hotel is located at the bottom of the hill with EZ access to the Union Square department stores, the many highly acclaim restaurants, and the theater district entertainment options.It felt like a luxury retreat in the heart of downtown. Yes, we enjoyed our stay and plan to come again to the VERY, VERY, NICE ... JW Marriott Union Square Hotel.","March 27, 2019","5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square

Offered a suite when we checked in (husband is platinum) and it offered great views and plenty of room. Only issue I felt in room was when I tried to close the blackening shades in the evening, it was hard to reach the pulls as they were right behind the big TV & desk. Not very convenient.

Had an upper floor (22nd) which was high enough to drown out street vehicle noise and late night bar shenanigans.

I would not have done that while the strike was ongoing, but fortunately the strike ended about a week before my trip. Perhaps because the strike led to some very poor reviews and/or turned off prospective guests, I got a very competitive room rate.Through my Marriott app, I told the hotel that I would be arriving around 1. Much to my surprise, not only was my room ready for occupancy upon my arrival, but the staff person who checked me in offered a slightly larger room on a high floor! This hotel’s location is perfect for those who come to San Francisco to shop, and it’s incredibly easy to get an Uber. For me the best feature (new since my last visit) was the excellent gym. It includes 2 spinning bikes, connected to a screen that offers professional teachers leading a wide variety of “classes.” Additionally, there are several treadmills, elliptical, weights, kettlebells and mats.","December 30, 2018","5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square

There was no housekeeping truly offered and no room service. Minus the mess with the Union strike, this is a good hotel to stay at if you want to be near Union Square. The hotel feels old-Marriott, ""it's time for a remodel"" at this location. The lobby is old, the rooms feel older and not sure I will stay at this property anytime again soon.

All of this would have been acceptable in the circumstances had there been a hint of how we would be compensated. Such bad customer relations left a bad taste and we will never use a Marriott group again. They have since refunded 1 nights stay , little to late.

The room we were given was perfect, a corner room which was a little larger, on a high floor with a great view of Union Square. We could still hear the strikers, but barely. The location was perfect for our needs. We had access to the Concierge Lounge on Thursday night (it's closed on Fri, Sat, Sun), and met Geoffrey who was a perfect gentleman. We've stayed in the Marriott Courtyard on Post, which is fine, but the rooms are very small. This hotel was much better.

318,"The unionize staff are picketing from 700AM to 1000PM making enough noise that they can be heard for blocks. The hotel services were impacted - no food, no laundry, no bar service. The hotel did not warn me at the time of booking that they were under strike action for the past month. I was essentially told at check in of the issue and given the last minute nature of the information had no choice but to grin and bear it. I was forced to cross a picket line and harassed as a result. To top it all off there were no towels in the room and the shower drain was clogged. There was no compensation or accommodation by the hotel staff. The lack of notification, in my opinion is their strategy to avoid customers choosing alternate accommodations. Despite expressing my dissatisfaction management did little and aside sending a patronizing email promising to bring up the issue with management have done nothing to retain my business. I recommend against staying at the Marriott chain while the strike action continues unless they make customers aware especially of the reduced services.","November 4, 2018","5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square

322,"The strike made for a very difficult stay. You needed earplugs as you approached from a block away. At check in we requested a room off the street and that was honored. The doors are such that trying to close them quietly is impossible which added to sleep issues from neighboring rooms. The first indication regarding the strike and lack of service was a letter in the room. It offered 500 points to rewards members if daily cleaning service wasn’t provided. Our tv didn’t work but was fixed the following day. It appeared that only a couple of 4 elevators were working. If you were on the 8th floor or lower and needed to get to the lobby you were pretty much out of luck. Our room was cleaned one day but on Sunday someone showed up at our room around 8pm to ask if we wanted clean towels. No cleaning that day. At check out we were told that we had 3 days of internet service to pay for but they would comp it. My husband said it should have been included as a silver elite member. The clerk said his number wasn’t noted and waved us on our way. I had thought I supplied the number when using Chase points for the reservation. I’ve never been at a Marriott property where they didn’t ask if you were a rewards member so we assumed it was on file. So no 500 points for no service either.

325,"Decent enough hostel. Hostel is located reasonably close to public transport and buses - it's pretty easy to get there from the airport. It is located a bit far away from a lot of tourist sites, but they are reasonably accessible through public transport, and it's close to a lot of good, cheap restaurants. Breakfast is provided, although it is quite basic.The rooms are good. Power points at beds and under-bed lockers (mesh design, bring your own padlock). Linen and towels are provided, showers and toilets are shared, there can sometimes be an availability issue when it's busy.Only major issue was that the hostel is under-staffed for it's size. Waits at check in and check out can be quite long, but it you're arriving outside of 'peak' times, it's probably not an issue.Complaints about location are all correct. It's located close to the Tenderloin, a neighbourhood with a poor reputation, and at night and during the day, there can be a lot of transient people around. That said, it's not exactly unsafe, sometimes can just be a bit unpleasant. If you've lived in a big city before, it's not exactly something that's going to be unfamiliar. I'd keep in mind that there are definitely some streets nearby that I wouldn't walk down after dark if you are obviously a tourist.","July 7, 2019","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

326,"Nice hostel with friendly personell, good service and a nice price compared to other places in SF. However, it can be crowded sometimes with groups of people checking in and out the whole day. This makes the service less available and can be annoying when you need to take a bath, are kept awake or want to have breakfast (which is pretty poor). Allthough it lays in downtown San Francisco, the location is not very good for visiting tourist attractions. For shopping it is, but that is mostly not where you take a hostel for. At night there are a lot of homeless people on the streets, so when you are a smoker... be prepared.

334,We opted for the hostel during our short stay at SFO and were impressed by the efficient no-nonsense nature of the facilities. The hostel itself is conveniently located from the nearest BART station (we disembarked at Powell St and walked up) so the commute to/from the SFO international airport was not much of a headache. The private room allocated to us was on 2nd floor facing the Niko hotel and it was well appointed. The front desk staff briskly ran us through the usual do/do-nots and off we were to settle in and go about on our business.The usual revelry and noisy nature of hostels is absent here - which is a great thing. The general noises from the street have never been a bother and in fact it is something that adds a bit of life to the general stay in the room. Housekeeping staff do a fantastic job of cleaning up the room and turning it around. Lots and lots of good eating places and other tourist-y things abound. The hostel lobby has a proper schedule of activities which can sign up for and participate. The staff and hostel guests go a long way in eliminating the feeling of a sterile place and instead there is emphasis on celebrating together and swapping stories.,"January 30, 2019","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

As a solo traveller who just wanted to rest, i liked that it had a vibe where everyone sort of kept to themselves. It's quite big so this makes sense.

336,"Please see the email below that we sent management about our experience at this hostel. We have had little response hence posting it as part of the review. On a side note the lift facilities are downright dangerous for a disabled traveller. Sometimes the gap between the floor level of the lift and building was up to 5 inches too high or too low and impassable on a mobility device. Hi,My name is Stephen Abraham. I am a disabled traveller visiting with my wife and son from Australia and current staying at the Hostel International San Francisco Downtown.I'd like to report an incident last night which has left us in distress.This is our first experience in a hostel and we have been looking forward to it for over a year. As we were driving into San Fran I rang the front desk to ask if there was somewhere we could disembark and then park the car temporarily. I informed her I required disabled parking. The lady on the phone told us there was nowhere to disembark and told us the nearest garage was at 525 Jones street - a very long way away for someone on a mobility scooter with cases and mobility aids to carry. After 30 minutes driving in circles looking for somewhere closer we pulled up illegally outside the hostel on Mason Street and I told my wife to cross the road the Mason O'farrel Downtown Garage and ask if we could park there. She ran back and found out we could! We had been driving in circles in heavy stressful traffic for no reason!When we checked in yesterday (31st of December) there were two people on staff and quite a queue so we waited patiently to check in. We were given our keys, asked about where best to view the New Years Eve fireworks, and went to settle in after a stressful time driving in in our hire car. We were given the wrong room names and my son had to line up again to sort out the problem. All of this we could write off as New Year's Eve pressure at a busy time. But our next experience we could not.When we arrived back at the hostel after the midnight fireworks and an awful Uber driver who challenged me about my disability, we came back to the hostel. There were many people arriving too. The office person (Ernesto I think) was yelling at people to show their room keys. As we had not been told we needed them to enter the building after 12pm (despite asking at check in about viewing the midnight fireworks) I had left my key in the room. My wife (taken aback to being yelled and told that her disabled husband couldn't enter the building) went to tell Ernesto that we hadn't been told this. He yelled back that was for our safety and that I couldn't enter without my key. My wife again taken aback at his forceful attitude went upstairs to get it for me. She came back and as she showed it again went to say that we hadn't been told this. Ernesto's response was awful. He told my wife she has a bad attitude and he wouldn't speak to her because she was being abusive. All she wanted to say was that we weren't told about the after 12pm key policy!We went to our room shaken, in tears and unable to sleep after this incident.I am sure that it was stressful for Ernesto being the only person on staff whilst many were attempting to come in the building. However: 1) it is not our fault that he was the only person there. 2) It was not our fault that he was stressed.3) It was not our fault that we weren't told the policy. We would like to formally complain about this treatment. My wife is a professional educator who deals with stressful situations everyday. She is carer for a disabled person. She does not deserve to be treated in this way.I'd like a response within 48 hours please and don't want to have to take this matter further.","January 7, 2019","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

337,"The best thing about this hostel is the location. I only stayed the night because I was passing thru SF before heading out of the country and I wanted to explore the city before I went. Unfortunately, I was there during SantaCon, traffic was shear madness and drunk people were everywhere. I say unfortunately because I almost missed my flight because the shuttle could not pick me up due to the gridlock traffic. This was not the hostel's fault. They were kind enough to get me to the subway so that I could make it to the airport. Okay, so about the hostel. It was clean, there is an elevator for your convenience or for anyone that is walking-impaired. They offer various activities on what seems to be a daily basis. Each bed has a light and electrical outlets along with USB ports. My room was somewhat clean but I will say I did arrive very late into the night and had roommates already in the room. However, when I dropped something behind the bed and I reached down to grab it, I noticed a few things left behind by previous tenants. I had a 4-bunk, female only room with a shared bathroom and even though the bed was fairly comfortable, the room was cold and you can hear just about every goings-on in the room next door or outside the room door. The bathroom seems like wasted space and could use more hooks on the barren walls. No soap given nor was there any soap in the dispenser in the shower. I guess it is a good thing I travel with soap, just in case. Regarding breakfast, there were some decent offerings (oatmeal, toast, bagels, cereal, juices, coffee, etc...) but get there early because it is like a feeding frenzy. You are expected to wash your own dishes though. Small price to pay for a bit of free breakfast. One improvement would be curtains on the beds for privacy, especially when your roommates have different schedules than yourself.","December 29, 2018","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

This time round I chose HISF travelling with hubby and son and was not disappointed.Although the triple bed room ( bunkstyle) is small (really too small for 3 people) it was still great value for staying in downtown San Francisco near Market Street attractions and shops. It also provided basic continental breakfast to start the day and staff were friendly. It is mainly serves the purpose to provide a bed and did not disappoint although 2 consecutive days of rain in SF holed us up more than we would have liked in the small room. Only downside besides the small room, was how muggy the room were and that the mattresses were a bit worn out, resulting us having, after a 3 day stay, some sore backs.

We arrived early and they let us leave our luggage in a special room so we can explore the city until the hour of our check in. The location is very good, but keep in mind that San Francisco is a big city so you will have to walk A LOT, even if you are in downtown.  It is very easy to go to and from the airport in the BART.","November 3, 2018","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

Breakfast was good, bagels with spread and coffe. Cool view. Parked the car in a garage 2 blockes down, ok price.

344,"My husband and I spent 5 nights here. Our first choice would have been a hotel but prices here in SF are crazy! When I checked in staff was really nice and helpful. Our room was 318, located in front of the stairs and looking out on the alleyway, I got really scared of the traffic noise but walls and doors are thick and could barely hear any noise. Bed was comfy, daily cleaning of our room, common spaces clean as well. Free breakfast is included but we never tried it. Location is great because you can walk to everywhere BUT you are 100m from the Tenderloin (worst neighbourhood) so you see a lot of homeless, drug addicts, mental illness. I arrived solo the first night and was prettified. The only one thing that tinted our experience is that the room was charged twice on my credit card. You can imagine it’s a good amount when you spent 5 nights. The blonde girl at the front desk looked at me like I was either stupid or annoying so she referred me to her colleague. He did try and find the info but didn’t solve the problem. In the end visa had to call them to cancel tat duplicate.. pretty annoying to spend an entire day of you vacation off the phone. A part from that it was good! Feel we paid too much for the room but hey it’s SAN Francisco right?","October 17, 2018","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

345,"We aren’t usually “hostel people” but due to the price of this hostel in comparison to other hotels in the area we thought we would give it a go. I am so glad we did. We had a private double ensuite room on the 2nd floor. The room was clean, and it was so cosy, much more personal than a hotel it felt like we were staying in a bedroom. The room was a good size and plenty cupboard space for our suitcases. I also liked the fact a hairdryer was provided and linen and towels too. The hostel also has several communal areas which were clean and well kept. We did attempt breakfast once but it was so busy we didn’t return. There was a big convention on in SF and I know the hostel was fully booked so that is nothing against the hostel and just bad timing of our visit. Staff were helpful and booked airport transport for us when requested. The hostel is centrally located and a 5 minute walk to Union Square and close to many bars and restaurants. I felt safe in the area, and in the hostel and they had security on checking the passes of everyone who was entering the building. Yes the area is noisy, but it’s the middle of a city and in an old building. Ear plugs were given and we both felt we slept well. We were glad our apprehension about staying in a hostel was proved wrong and would stay here again if ever back in San Francisco.","October 8, 2018","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

346,"It was a good hostel to stay in,it did us well for two days but has room for improvements and the price began creeping towards that of a hotel, but with less comfort. It was nice having the lockers under beds and supplying sheets, douvets and what not.One of the main issues for me was food, I have allergies to nuts and as I was about to have some jam(jelly) on bread, someone grabbed the knife from the peanut butter and stuck it in the jam to create a PBJ.Really made me think what else I can't eat.Overall I think I would stay again, but if it was more affordable or the price we paid reflected the service.","September 27, 2018","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

347,Stayed in a private room. The room size was great and the bathroom ok but the carpet was filthy and very stained and there was a lot of mold on the bathroom window. Even though it is a very old building for the price I was expecting at least a clean room. The room is serviced daily but sometimes the towels were taken and not replaced. Some front desk staff are very friendly and others quite rude. The location is ok but there is a lot of noise from the street all night and bright lights shone in from the parking lot next door since there is only a thin curtain. The free breakfast was tasty but there is not enough seating in the kitchen. ,"September 23, 2018","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

The hostel itself was mostly clean, and the WiFi was pretty good until around 9pm where I assume everyone started to use it.The facilities were mostly clean, and the showers were a good pressure and nice a hot. We had mixed reviews with the staff, when we checked in the person checking us in was quite cold towards us but then later on in the week we had another woman who was really lovely and helpful! Breakfast is basic, just bagels but it’s free.Overall, it’s good if you are backpacking as it’s safe and mostly clean.

353,"PROS: I stayed at the private en suite room, and must say that the cleanliness and functionality of the room exceeded my expectations. The bathroom was super clean, and the queen-sized bed was comfortable enough. I stayed on the third floor, so had close proximity to the kitchen and water cooler - a definite plus! The location is quite good - central and accessible to most sites. Oh, and make sure you check out Cafe Mason, which is right next to the hostel. Would highly recommend their Croque Madame and pumpkin pancakes. CONS: The only downside to my accommodation experience here was the noise. Be warned: if you stay in a street-facing room (mine faced Mason Street), you will be in for a racket at night. There were several nights when a dude played drums right outside Pinecrest Diner, which is right across from the hostel, and did so for two hours plus from midnight to 2 AM. Needless to say, then, I didn't have great quality of sleep during my week's stay at the hostel. Yes, there were free earplugs in my room, but they did not quite mitigate the loudness coming from the streets. It's not really the hostel's fault, but if I were to give a suggestion for improvement, perhaps the hostel could make the walls and rooms more sound-proof.

We were able to store our bags on the day we checked out as we had a late flight, this was very helpful and convenient. The not so great is mainly to do with noise levels. We were in a room at the back, which we initially thought would be quieter.. not so much. The lane that we were looking into was a hive of activity.. noisy activity each night. In addition we saw peope shooting up and smoking drugs in there. Additionally, there was music that kept coming into our room from early in the morning. It was not coming from the room next door or the common room.. it was coming out of the floor. Totally bizarre. It was loud enough to record on my phone and play back clearly. The hostel is clean, beds are comfy and room was spacious. The area, whilst close to things is not so desirable, however there are far more expensive hotels in exactly the same area with the same smell of wee and homeless people hassling them too...

357,"The actual room, cleanliness, location and general facilities were very good. However I was greeted by the most unimpressed staff member who would not give me any extra information I might need unless I asked for it. The laundry facilities are cheap, but no instructions are given in the room as to how the payment/dryer works. There is a change machine so that you can buy detergent from the vending machine, but then the washers and dryers require you to swipe your card to activate them? I also found out later that you pay for as many dryer cycles as you require, and that one cycle doesn't just do the job. So I spent the rest of my night trying to air dry my clothes in my room, which I'm sure my dorm mates didn't appreciate. The bed light did not work for me and when I brought the issue up with reception, she wrote it down and said she would get maintenance to look into it. Later that day when I went back and the light issue still wasn't fixed, I went down to reception to ask them again. I was met with the same unimpressed lady who could not give a crap that something was wrong. She said 'oh if it's been reported to maintenance that's all we can do'. If she had been a bit nicer about it I don't think I would have minded so much, just that she was absolutely not bothered with any issue irritated me.","June 4, 2018","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

We parked our car in a garage that wasnt 24 hours and had a 6am flight to catch. Zoey called the parking garage and our car rental place for us and wouldn’t get off the phone with them until she received a resolution for us (about an hour).

After landing at LAX, then finding out my flight up to San Francisco was delayed, then cancelled, then I was rebooked on the next flight which was also delayed, meant I arrived about 4hrs after I expected too. Upon check in my card kept declining (plenty of money on it, turns out that card would only work at Starbucks and a few food places haha, don’t even know why) the girls were lovely and asked if I had another card after trying a couple times. I did and everything was good. They were really lovely and when I mentioned I was from Melbourne, one of the girls mentioned she had been there earlier in the year and we had a good chat about how the two cities were pretty similar in a lot of ways (which is legit Melbourne and San Francisco are the same vibe it’s great) and this was a great start to my time in San Francisco as I was absolutely exhausted after the long flight from Melbourne, plus the flight cancelation/delays, definitely helped perk me up a lot to have a friendly chat!The hostel itself was clean and comfy, and loved that the beds each had a panel with a light, USB ports and a power point too. Plus lockers under the bed are handy. And being a tall person, it was nice to be able to sit up in my bottom bunk and not be hunched over or hitting my head, as they gave ample room! The room I was in had a sink which was cool, made for a quick teeth brushing/face washing easy. Breakfast was lovely. A variety of fruits and oats, plus toast and bagels, and juice or tea/coffee. The location itself is very good, just a short walk down the Powell street station, which is where the BART from San Francisco airport stops so it’s good if you’re catching the BART from the airport. Close to lots of food places and bars, plus the Westfield if you need some retail therapy. The historic cable car is just around the corner near the train too, which I recommend to any visitors, it’s a lovely ride down to fishermans wharf!The building is safe and secure, with staff checking your room keycard upon entry to ensure only guests are coming in.

372,"FYI: I stayed in a double room with en suite bathroom.This room was not cheap, but importantly it was clean and the location was convenient. You might think that this would be like a hotel room but in a hostel, but that wasn't quite the case. The room didn't quite have all the things a hotel room might have such as an iron, a fridge or a TV but that didn't really bother me too much. I didn't visit to watch TV. In the shower, instead of little toiletries, I got a soap dispenser that cheerfully suggested I should give it a try (I don't remember the wording but I'm pretty sure it had an ""!"" at the end).The bed was comfortable enough, with bedside lighting, and there were power sockets to charge my phone. The wifi was string in my room and nice and speedy. The walls were roughly and colourfully painted as you'd expect in a hostel. But let's move on to the windows.These single windows could be opened upwards and were large and let in a decent amount of light. However they were only one pane thick so being in downtown SF and only one storey up, it was VERY noisy. In the window sills outside there was a bed of various detritus - not a nice thing to look at or even to stand near. None of these were deal breakers - the noise might have been but flights and touristy activities meant I was too exhausted to miss out on sleep but if you're a light sleeper consider asking if there's a more suitable room - or go elsewhere.The hostel itself was okay, communal areas are okay and breakfast is provided. Here you walk into the kitchen and take some fruit or a bagel and spoon on a topping. Cutlery is freely available but you are expected to wash it all yourself once you've finished. It's actually very well run - such a thing could easily descend into chaos but supplies are regularly replenished and washed up things are put away promptly.The staff are friendly and helpful and the cleaners do a thorough job around the building. There is a very handy convenience store right next door. The location of this hostel is extremely central, but it's a fair walk to the docks over some steep hills. The trolley service is right next to you though so that's one way to crest the hills.","November 12, 2017","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

375,"I booked a private room to stay with my wife. bed was a bunk bed, we had a bathroom sink in our room which was good. Shower and restroom were shared.Breakfast was included. Basically: bagel (jelly, peanut butter, cream cheese), juice, coffee and a fruit.The location is great since the metro is 10 minutes from the hostel. Luxury brand shops and cable cars are around the corner so it is very touristic. Vibe of the hostel is good. They plan different activities during the week. Walk tours, movie nights, etc. just beside the hostel you could buy drinks, snacks, etc.Staff was friendly. If you have a car just in front of the hostel there is a parking place. It is $30 per night while there is another one just 2 blocks away for $20 per night.I suggest to pay the extra $10, I research the other spot and a lot of people claim the area feel dangerous. For an extra $10 you have your car just in front of the property.Be safe and enjoy!Cheers,David","November 3, 2017","6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel

Plus there are a couple of decent eateries opposite and sine bars close by.The reason the review is not higher is the damp odour that greeted us in the room. We got used to it but was a bit off putting every time you entered the room. Toilet was fine with a good flush and the shower was warm and worked. Bed was comfortable and the TV worked. A ceiling fan meant that the room temperature could be maintained.

384,"I travelled to San Francisco with my sister for a trip to the West Coast. San Fran was our first stop. It’s a pretty expensive city to stay in and this hostel was just about in our budget. We booked a private queen room with a shared bathroom. The room was really tidy and clean when we arrived- with some towels and complimentary shampoo. Our room was a bit muggy so we had to keep the fan on most of the time. We also couldn’t turn the heating off which came on most nights! The breakfast was okay, not much choice, but it’s free so can’t complain! They take security quite seriously and you have to show you room card every time you enter reception for them to let you up to your room- always good to feel secure in a city you’ve never visited before. The showers were a bit grungy and there’s not much room to put your clothes, towel, etc. But it’s easy enough to put up with for a few nights.

I showed my confirmation and was told by the person on the desk even though i was right, there was nothing he could do about it (as apparently his system was more right) and that i’d have to pay the same price to stay in shared accommodation! I ended up taking it further to the manager, who then gave me one free nights stay in a 4 bed dorm but still charged me the private room rate for the second night! The manager promised to look into the issue of what happened but I never heard back on this.Don’t bother staying here. If you reserve a bed in a 12 bedroom dormitory they will probably downgrade you to sleep outside on the street.

416,"I was on a business trip, went to a conference but needed a cheap place to stay near the Moscone Center. I stayed here for a week (Sun through Sat) and had zero complaints. The crew is super nice and the rooms are clean, so are the showers. They have complimentary breakfasts (toasts and some fruit basically) which saved me a couple of days. Great vibe and cool guests. They have a common area on the basement which I really liked. Would definitely recommend it.Cons: This place is located close to the Tenderloin. You will see a lot of homeless people in the area which was shocking for me. The mail area is wide open and people could easily sneak in and get some of your stuff. I was very worried cause I did some online shopping. No elevators and stairs everywhere, beware if you have special needs (like a wheelchair).","June 18, 2018","7    USA Hostels San Francisco

We managed to take him out and gave advice to the receptionist of the situation but she looked at my friend as he was lying and did nothing, he tried to get into our room like two more times ,obviously we went again to the receptionist and she told us she was calling her manager to see what she could do, on his third time trying to enter into the room he broke my nose. The hostel never called the police, I went to the hospital because obviously I was under pain and my nose was bleeding and I had to pay 1000 usd to be attended in the hospital. I lost my entire night going from the hospital to the police. I had the worst moment of my life and you know what? the guy went back to the hostel and they let him stay there as nothing happened. On the next day they told him he should go, and that’s all. the worst attention I had in my entire life was here and the only thing they did to try to mend the situation was: we are sorry and they changed us to another room, they didn’t give me the money I payed to the hospital back or at least the money of the stay here to cover some costs of the problem they should have managed from the beginning. So if you want to travel safe and stay in a place where if something happens the place you are staying helps you or respond well to the situation don’t go to USA hostels you won’t be safe.","March 23, 2018","7    USA Hostels San Francisco

The staff are friendly, engaging and authentic to a point where one feels ""adopted"" into their family/community. I had the pleasure of meeting, talking and breaking bread with caring patrons from around the world.

464,"Unfortunately USA hostels fell a little short of expectation for me & my partner given all the great reviews. The location is decent although a bit of a 15-20min walk uphill from the Powell St Bart Station with heavy luggage- we had friends stay at the Parc 55 hotel which was much more central and better value (in terms of cleanliness, proximity, sound proofing)- we really wished we had stayed there as we heard from my friends that Parc 55 was only a little bit more expensive than our private room. Upon arrival, check in service was fine and efficient. The lifts were much needed although lift doors a bit awkward to negotiate with heavy luggage (old building). We stayed on the 4th floor in a private double room with private bathroom. The room was very small, smelled of sewage and carried a lot of noise from downstairs when the window was open. We had to try and open the window for air as it was very hot even with a ceiling fan- however this meant that we had barely any sleep at night (from staff/residents/guests/neighbours- talking outside meant the noise carried up) or in the morning. We couldn't sleep until 12 am most nights and would be woken up at 6am by the noise of people (unsure if USA Hostel Staff) working downstairs. We had to shut the window one night in order to get any sleep. The bed linen was very rough and worn. Our one window also faced directly opposite someone else's room who was probably only 2-3 metres away in another building which interfered with privacy and and I needed to keep the curtains closed most of the time, but got very warm in the process).We had one episode where I was woken up and kept up from 11.30pm-1am in the morning due to the next door guest/neighbour playing very loud music, being very drunk and loud with banging and crashing that made me very concerned. I actually had to call the front desk at 12.15am as I was too afraid to go outside of my room to report it downstairs- it sounded as if the people next door were high on drugs with a mix of alcohol and I was wary of how they would respond in an inebriated state if I were to ask them to keep the noise down. Unfortunately the Front desk staff reported that they were unable to do anything as they were the only staff on duty but said that they would pass it on to the next staff member. When I reported the incident in the morning, this information had not passed it on. However, the staff member who I reported it to later said that he would deal with the matter.","September 29, 2017","7    USA Hostels San Francisco

The hostel is very big so people are going and coming all the time, but it was still relativly quiet in the rooms which was good. The breakfasts are included and are nice - as long as you aren't gluten free which would definitely be a problem! The staff are helpful and personable, although I did get the impression that they are used to a younger crowd (I am 36) and so they did not suggest any of the events they organise, although they did recommend them to younger travellers, which seemed a bit strange. The hostel is well kept and clean and the dorms were fine (I stayed in 3 during my period there).

The lighting, power points and fan ( yes no air con) are all like something from the 80s. The quality of the bathroom fittings are poor.

The hotel is a short walk of about 10 minutes to Union Square and shopping and also the start of one of the street car routes to Fisherman’s Wharf. Also if you are using the hop on/off bus the nearest stop is less than 10 minutes away.The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel clean and tidy. We needed advice on getting to an emergency room (which is a block away) which they were only to happy to advise on.There was only one thing that was a little hazy about our stay when we arrived they took a swipe of our card which then we later noticed charged money from our bank account this is a held fee in case you charge anything to your room.

First used as a speakeasy during prohibition with an underground entrance in the 1920s, the venue took the (Plush Room) Cabaret Theatre name in 1926. It was located in what was then the Empire Hotel. While the plush room is no more today, there is a side-entrance door off the main lobby to remind you of what was once a wonderful experience to San Francisco’s past. Not only were all the people who worked here very nice, but also very helpful with any needs or questions. -They made us feel very comfortable. Our room was small but very comfortable and met all our expectations to include a very comfortable rain-shower feature which was great after a long day of walking.

There is the skeleton of a cafe but when I asked about it I was told it doesn't open any more - no explanation, no apology.'Complimentary morning newspaper' never appeared.'Business center in the lobby' is one PC, printer and chair.I made a point of emailing before I visited to ask if cards for deposit payments are just authorised or if payment would actually be taken then refunded - they confirmed payment wouldn't be taken but when I checked out, big shocker, the funds had been taken from my card so I'm now waiting for the refund.My room was clean and the size I expected but not the standard - see pics for unsightly wiring/trunking and an exposed threshold into the walk in wardrobe/safe area which is pretty painful to step on/stub your toe on.Dark lower wall and carpet colours make it feel dingy and dull. The heating system is awful - unit build into the wall which can be set on 'fan' or 'heat' ... and there's no middle ground for either so the room was cold and then after 10mins set on 'heat' it's stifling. Only 2 or 3 of the channels on the TV consistently received signal, the others repeatedly dropped out. Don't know if you'd class it as a motel but it's definitely not a hotel.Location wise if you're a tourist I'd recommend being in the Fisherman's Wharf area instead (unless your budget allows for a Union Square hotel)","February 14, 2019","8    Hotel Vertigo

My friend and I were met by Christina at reception. Warm and welcoming. Which is great after an 11 hour flight. Smooth and easy check in. Great recommendations for food in the local area and given a map for directions around the city. We chose to upgrade to a 2 bed room. Great facilities in room. Coffee, tea, shower over bath, fabulous quality of toiletries. The shampoo is amazing.safe and ironing facilities. Water is $2 a bottle but that's the average price for a 500 ml bottle. After the jet lag kicked we were wide awake so stepped outside for some fresh air at 02.30 am. Welcomed back into the hotel by Sam the lovely night desk watchman. As our next flight changed schedules once again reception staff Christina and Cynthya service shone through and assisted us with shuttle bus bookings and recommendations for things to do whilst we have a few hours left in San Francisco. The housekeeping teams have kept our room nice and clean and topted up with refreshments and toiletries.So our stay has been even more brilliant, as the hotel has felt like a home from home. With there excellent service with that added human touch which has made all the difference. I will happily stay here again and will recommend this hotel to anyone. Thank you to you front line ladies and Sam. You've made our stay such a joy and has made our trip here that extra bit special. Keep doing what you do. You are all a credit to this hotel and company.","February 2, 2019","8    Hotel Vertigo

499,"The Hotel Vertigo is outdated, cramped, and lacks the additional amenities that are expected of a hotel. They are in the process of renovating, but from what I could tell the changes were superficial. When I was there, the coffee shop was closed and there was no onsite restaurant. Had I spent more than a few hours awake in the hotel I could have been bored without easy access to coffee, limited tv channels, and slow internet. ","January 28, 2019","8    Hotel Vertigo

500,"This hotel was somewhat better priced than the larger chains, so I decided to book and was glad I did. The business center is very basic. However, the lobby is comfortable, and the WiFi is reliable. I was able to get my work done. The architecture and decorating are fascinating. Although I visited during an unusually rainy period, the views are very nice. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I had a heating issues in my room that could not be fixed, so they promptly placed me in another room that was very comfortable. The cafe was closed, so they recommend Mr. Holmes Bakehouse around the corner. The coffee and pastries were delicious and quite reasonable. The surrounding neighborhood is safe and has many conveniences such as a variety of restaurants, drug stores, and fitness studios.","January 18, 2019","8    Hotel Vertigo

502,"I had booked a room at Hotel Vertigo for a local conference I was attending. I had done my internet research on affordable hotels in the CBD in San Fransico and came across this hotel. The history and nostalgia of the hotel prompted me to make a reservation. Wasn't sure what to expect having flown 14 hours from New Zealand to San Fransico. When I had arrived I was greeted by a friendly staff who made my check-in seamless. The room was small but adequate for my 4-day stay. You could feel the history oozing out of the walls from when the hotel first made its debut in the 1958 Alfred Hitchcock movie, 'Vertigo'. The hotel was perfectly located in the heart of San Fransico making it easy to get to restaurants, stores and attractions. The highlight for me was walking down to the fish market at Fishermen's Wharf and enjoying the freshly caught seafood and a glass of wine. I love the character and history of this hotel and would definitely stay at the hotel again when in San Fransico next.","January 1, 2019","8    Hotel Vertigo

503,"My husband and I stayed here for the first few nights of a trip travelling in California, for our stay in San Francisco. There was a nice welcome from the hotel and the staff were friendly. But the room that we were put in to start off with was pretty awful. It was on the ground floor and whilst decorated nicely, the bathroom was very strange and the 'view' was of the fire escape! I couldn't reach the floor whilst sitting on the toilet, I'm not a short person but I thought this was quite strange. So we asked to change rooms and the friendly lady at reception said yes of course but not now. So we asked when we came back, only to be told we needed to ask in the morning! We asked again in the morning and eventually got moved to a much better room - with some daylight as a starting bonus. It wasn't an upgrade and from what they said at reception they had spare rooms, I can't imagine why you'd put anyone in our first room when there was another room free but hey ho. On the whole our stay was good but I felt a little disappointed with being crammed in the basement at the start. Tip for travellers - ask for a room on one of the upper floors, the lift is a bit of a pain but at least you feel human.","December 28, 2018","8    Hotel Vertigo

509,"This is typically a 3 star hotel. Personally i wouldn’t highly recommend it. It’s ideal for its position, close to buses, trams, cable car and a short walk to the BART. We saved $ by getting the bart from the airport to Union Square. The hotel room is big enough for a couple and the bed is very comfortable with white fresh bedding. However there is no view, just a brick wall. A coffee machine with cardboard cups, a fridge for your use and USB ports are available free of charge. All ideal for us as we were out from 8am everyday not returning before 8pm. If you wanted to spend any length of time in the room it’s probably not for you. Nice shower with shampoo and body wash, clean towels and flannels everyday. Gym on site that we didn’t use. Receptionist helpful for local information. ","November 19, 2018","8    Hotel Vertigo

The rooms are quite nice and clean, comfy bed, walk in wardrobe with safe, tea/coffee making facilities, t.v. and some toiletries provided. The location was quiet and we had good sleep quality.

511,We stayed in the Hotel for 3 nights as part of a family tour of Western America. At first we were unsure of the location as it is right on the edge of the Union Square area. Once we got settled we were happy that it was in a good spot. The hotel looks really stylish with a strong link to the film Vertigo (constantly played on the screen behind reception ). The rooms were a good size and functional with the same colour scheme as the rest of the place. The staff were very helpful and sorted us out with places to eat and transfer to the airport. We went to the top of the hotel to get the Vertigo feeling looking down. This was very impressive even though the hotel should be called acrophobia!

The trim on the lamps was worn out, the shower valve leaked, the toiletries were minimal and low quality, the molding was grubby...all small things but they added up to a depressing ambiance. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the room was quiet. The staff was fine - polite when checking in, but no greeting whilst I was coming and going - again, didn’t matter to me, but it might to you.

I did purchase pastries there and they were quite good. On the other hand, the barista informed me the coffee machine wasn't working, so all they had to offer was espresso. Mind you, I like espresso, but a single shot doesn't replace a cup of coffee, so I opted for double shots.

Our stay was only really let down by the guy on the front desk the first couple of mornings we stayed there. He was reasonably helpful until he realised we wouldn't buy tickets for the open top tour service (that we assume he got commission for), and then resorted to vague grunts and avoiding eye contact to give us directions to the nearest bus stops.

I’ve stayed before in the past. The Willows is a very humble bed and breakfast nicely decorated, amazingly clean, safe and well managed by a great team who are very polite and helpful. If its a five star hotel your looking for the Willows makes no claim to be so but there is five star service. There are a few things the guest needs to know before considering booking and I want to be honest with readers. The city of San Francisco has had for many years a large homeless problem which is visible in this neighbourhood. Some guests may find this off putting. It’s a fact of life in this city and not confined to areas around the bed and breakfast. The Willows has shared bathroom/shower toilet facilities. There are no en suites. These facilities are spotless.The business is well managed. There is a nice lounge sitting area and also breakfast buffet is laid out in the kitchen in the morning. I love this place. When out on the street it’s walking distance to the Castro. The MUNI, BART and Bus system is extensive and easy to use. ","June 20, 2019","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

525,"After climbing the long entry steps, we loved everything about the Willows Inn! Lively Castro District location; cozy, clean, safe and comfortable home base for my girlfriends-from-around-the-world reunion. Can't say enough about owner Mike and his friendly staff being so helpful and kind during our week's stay. Very reasonable prices on the 12-room accommodations in this refurbished mansion, with lovely antiques and mini fridges in each room.  Transportation, many ethnic restaurants, atmospheric taverns, Whole Foods, and even a 24-hr Safeway are within short blocks of the Willows Inn front door.  Our favorite group excursion over the last weekend in October was to get tix for a 2-day plus 1-night Hop-On Hop-Off Big Bus tour, which has 20 stops all over the city, and a live guided tour translated by earphones into 10 languages. Make sure to hop off in Haight-Asbury to walk the beautiful, historic main street filled with interesting shops, and hop off at Golden Gate Park to visit the Science Center, Imax, plus Aquarium for one price. And you can't miss Fisherman's Wharf to hear the sea lions argue and play with each other while you sample seafood.  Then, what a treat to retreat to our separate rooms back at the Willows, and convene in the Library/Sitting Room for our own happy hour before deciding on a dinner restaurant nearby. Our favorite was the very popular, delicious Spanish restaurant Picada down the street.

526,"This Bed and Breakfast Inn is very nice. The actual entrance is a door at street level. It was difficult to find at first. Once entering, there is a beautiful staircase leading up to check-in. The owners were wonderful and made us feel welcomed. There were historic, framed photographs from around SF on the walls and older furniture. Our room was another flight up but we had help with our luggage. Note: there is no elevator, so if you have special needs, you may want to make sure they can accommodate you. Our room was cozy and welcoming. Plenty of closet space and 2 robes available. There is a refrigerator in the room and a sink. There were nice toiletries. The bed was comfortable. We loved the thick Roman shades that really darkened the room in the morning. A short distance down the hall were water closets. They were very clean and private. There were also private showers. Although we didn't use them, they were also immaculate. There is a kitchen on second floor that had snacks available. In the morning, this is where the breakfast is served. We did not have time to try the breakfast but previous reviews have raved about it. The B&B is in the Castro area and convenient for enjoying the area or taking public transit to other areas of the city. I rated the place a 4 because parking is difficult. This is so convenient without a car. I wish we had left ours at home. The nearest parking garage is quite a distance away. And, the streets were having public works working on them.

530,"I stayed at this place during the July long weekend and beyond. When I booked, the owners sent me an e-mail with the directions to the inn from SF Airport. I followed the directions to the T, and had no problem finding the place. It takes almost 30-45 minutes in train/subway to reach from SF international airport to this place. Just make sure to have enough USD in cash with you, as the machines at the stations are not very friendly with credit/debit cards. (In fact, there is a man that makes money from tips by helping visitors on how to operate the machine)The location is very close the Church Street subway, plus you can take the bus/streetcar from the street to access SF downtown. I was given a room at the second floor. The room was clean, with fresh sheets on the bed, a table, drawers, a cupboard , a small TV and a basin with toiletries. The Wi-Fi speed is adequate.The staff was very friendly and helped me with directions to nearby restaurants and attractions. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance of this place. There is also a Safeway opposite this place. So finding a place to eat is not a problem, even if you happen to be a vegetarian (I am one).The place serves breakfast every morning. Yogurt with all the helpings of dry-fruit, all kinds of bread with spreads (I had my first taste of vegemite), cereals, cheese, boiled eggs, juice-coffee-tea and a freshly baked treat every morning (Although after a while it could get repetitive). I wish they included more savoury treats in the morning, but I know American breakfast doesn't include savoury/salty items.The washrooms and bathrooms were clean. No complaints there. I liked the request card about not wasting the water.The payment was upfront when I checked in. I found it bit odd, but on hindsight, I was in hurry when I was leaving and the payment process would have just delayed my departure. So don't regret having an upfront payment.During my stay, I saw people from all demographics. This place does not serve to just specific clienteles.Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this place.The reasons why I didn't give a 5 rating to the property1) This is an old house converted into a residence. So if you are carrying luggage with you, you are on your own when it comes to carrying luggage to your room. I have a bad back and wasn't happy carrying my bag to the room.2) The house is old and has that old carpet smell.3) There are no central or window AC. So either you keep the window open at night or use fan. Luckily, it didn't get very warm at night when I was staying. Opening window at night invites street noise.4) There are some shady characters loitering near this place during night. I am not sure if there is any care taker during night and the possibility of trespassing. (Yes - I am being a bit paranoid here)5) They gave me a key form the main entrance and the room. In case you lose your key and you come home late at night, I am not sure what would be your options.6) The washrooms were clean and had a hand sanitizer, but having to walk to your room to wash your hands just seemed a bit odd.","August 19, 2017","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

The Inn management were welcoming and helpful and kept the place spotlessly clean. We slept well and always went out full up and ready to go with a healthy and tasty breakfast and good coffee. Reasonably priced (for San Francisco!) and overall a very good experience.,"July 8, 2017","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

533,"I and my family stayed and The Willows Inn for 5 days end of April. It was a great pleasure and exceeded our expectations.Enviable location, just in front of a trolley, bus and metro stop, closed to Mission and Castro districts which are two of the most beautiful districts of Frisco.The hosts were so kind since the time of booking, helping us to find the best solution for our accommodation. The rooms are spacious and clean, restrooms and bathrooms in the common spaces are not a problem at all. Priceless the square chocolate you find in your room when you arrive. Really appreciated.Excellent breakfast where you can find all what you want, including a lot of organic food. It was also a pleasure to meet and have a talk with other guests during breakfast.I will absolutely come back to the Willows Inn when I return to Frisco and will recommend it to everyone asking me a suggestion where to accommodate in the city.","May 4, 2017","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

534,This place is so welcoming. The rooms are large and updated. Water closets and bath rooms down the hall. Fill out what you want for breakfast night before. Afternoon tea each day and wine and cheese each night. When you go out for night they turn down the bed and put a glass of port on your nightstand.

535,"It was a delight to check in here for the 3rd time within two years.Handy to lots of local public transport and within walking distance of the centre of Castro, the Willows Inn nevertheless provides a quiet and cozy home away from home. The rooms are charming and very comfortable, and there is also a lovely living room in which we can read, watch TV, watch a movie or chat with others.Please do not worry about the shared showers and toilets, as they are close to all rooms, and they are immaculately serviced, cleaned and maintained at all times.There is plenty of information available about the specifically GLBT attractions of San Francsico, as well as about all the many other fascinations of this amazing city.The breakfast room is small and friendly, and the cold buffet selection is excellent - breads & muffins with toaster, spreads, fruit, cereals, yoghurts, beverages. And for the Australians, they have Vegemite available!Above all, our hosts welcome us with very friendly courtesy, really valuing our patronage, and making guests feel at home over and over again, and being eager to help whenever they can.The F-tram, operating from Castro through Downtown and to Fisherman's Wharf, leaves from across the road, whilst MUNI trams and buses are also just across the road. In short - I just love this guest house, and can't wait until I can stay here again!","April 23, 2017","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

They announced an aperohour in the evening, but there was nothing. The inn is very clean and the rooms are cosy and you feel comfortable.

We liked the way breakfast was served with lots of fruit and bread laid out in the kitchen which you could put on a tray and take back to your room or eat in the kitchen if you fancied a chat with other guests. Was a bit worried about the shared shower rooms and toilets, but it wasn't a problem and never had to wait to use. The guest house was just round the corner from the muni station and trolley bus stop which meant it was very easy to get anywhere in the city.

540,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was amazing. Between the comfortable rooms, the friendly staff, the great location, and the reasonable price, I cannot say enough great things about the Willows. The staff were friendly and helpful, always ready with a suggestion on where to go or what to do. Their dining recommendations were always on point. Different people had different styles (some pointed us to their book of restaurants in the area, others suggested their favorite places to eat. They joined us for the wine hour in the library, which was a wonderful and relaxing way to get to know them better. Breakfast had a lot of options for us, which was good. The kitchen was a bit cozy, but we were always able to get in to get food without a problem. One morning we decided to eat in our room, just because of the space concerns in there.The rooms were clean and our room was quite big. We had gotten one of the larger rooms in the place, and the space was good for us. We did get to peek in some of the other rooms, and while they were smaller, they were not unreasonably so. The bathrooms were always clean, the showers were wiped down in between uses. We had a sink in our room, which was nice to cut down on lines to use the bathroom to brush teeth. You cannot beat the location. Right in the center of the city, with easy access to all forms of public transit available in the city. Most of it was right outside the door, and the BART was just a short walk away. And we're still blown away at the price. We had looked at hotel prices in the city and didn't think we'd be able to afford a trip to San Francisco, but then we found this place and it was like a dream come true.We absolutely will stay here for all of our future trips to San Francisco. I've recommended this place to friends of mine and their opinions have been the same.","September 25, 2016","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

541,"Very well located in San Francisco, near to bus stop and underground station, the Willows Inn is a quiet place to stay next to Castro and Mission. Several restaurants are nearby and it's not too far from SFO international. The bed and breakfast has very charming rooms, wide and clear, but not all of them. I stayed in a family room which was a little bit narrow for three and less confortable than other rooms I saw. The room was not very clear, we had a view on bins, but very quiet; the closet too was too small for three travelling with big suitcases. The strong points: the b&b has bathrooms and showers to share but everything works perfectly and it is very clean. Breakfast is very convivial in the kitchen and rich. Special thanks to Mike who is a really lovely person very helpful and patient. I will go back but I wiil ask for the queen size bedroom next time.","September 5, 2016","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

543,"It was a comfortable stay of 9 nights in SF from 12-21 Aug 2016. The place was nicely furnished, coming across as comfy. The room I stayed in had enough space to not feel cramped in. Staff were professional and helpful.Great location, less than 1 min walking distance from Church station, and good eats around the area. A downside to road-facing rooms is the noise level at night, which is contributed by frequent muni metro/rapid transits, and bar clients from the 2 adjacent bars, the latter of which dies down by 2+am. Not recommended for light sleepers.All in all it was a good stay.","August 21, 2016","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

My room was scrupulously clean with a really comfortable bed and for people with worries about shared showers/toilets - don't! Both were always available when I wanted them and always very clean. All hosts were friendly and they provide lots of written information about local transport and how to get where you want to go. I stayed just before Pride so there were lots of friendly gay/bi guys to talk to at breakfast who also gave their own recommendations of places to go. It was my first time in San Francisco and I hope to come back. If I do, I would definitely stay here again.","July 12, 2016","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

545,"We stayed in the Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn for a total of 11 days (a weekend away over the period) in April-May 2016. It suited us perfectly. We loved the conviviality of chatting with other guests over breakfast (great variety - lots of fruit, cereals, pastries, breads, yoghurts, etc), and, when we could, relaxing with our hosts and other guests over a glass of wine (or beer) in the sitting room / library before going out to dinner in the evenings. Willows is located in the vibrant Mission / Castro district, and a few dozen metres from excellent buses, trams and metro - very easy to go down town or elsewhere in the city, or to the BART, CalTrain or highways to head out of town. We stayed in room 32 for our longer period - on the top floor, beautifully decorated and spacious with a bay window facing south, so lovely and sunny in spring while we were there. Double glazing helps keep street noise down if windows are closed, and windows can be opened for cooling breezes. The WCs and showers are separate from the rooms, with two of each on each floor and are not a great difficulty (at least while we were there over a relatively quiet period) - robes provided for each guest and there is a basin in each room, and toiletries provided. This means the room price is relatively low for the quality of the rooms, service, convivial atmosphere and the location in this expensive city!

547,"What a great B&B! We always try to stay in a B&B on our travels because they provide the most personable experiences. We were a little apprehensive about The Willows because the nightly rate for our room was so much less than we expected, and they only asked us to pay for the first night when we made our reservations. In a city like San Francisco, we expected much higher room rates and to be charged in total up front. Just the beginning of a great visit! I just have to mention that what really makes this place SPECIAL are all of the little touches such as robes in the room, small baskets filled with shower essentials including a shower cap to take to the shower, oversize towels, room service daily if desired.We made these reservations in May 2015 for our visit the last of Feb and early Mar 2016. We were first attending a ""Destination Wedding"" in Cancun Mexico and decided to fly on to San Francisco from there for a few days. We had never been to S.F. before, so this was our first experience. We absolutely loved it and our four days there.The Willows Inn is sort of hidden between two businesses with only a sign and a door with a bell to ring. Once buzzed in, we were greeted by one of the four guys (Michael, JoJo, Mark, & Gary) who operate the Inn. We were faced by a long flight of stairs up to the next level where the B&B was. Seeing those stairs made my heart sink because I knew I could not possibly carry my bags up those stairs (I am 70 and have had two heart surgeries). Thank goodness the wonderful man who greeted us took our bags and bounded up the stairs. Our room was actually on the next level (LOL!), but it was not yet ready. We checked in and took the innkeeper's suggestion that we go get a bite to eat first. He gave wonderful directions and recommended a great place for lunch. Upon returning to the B&B, we found that he had moved all of our belongings upstairs to our room, and he gave us a tour of the full place.There are so many things I want to mention about this great place! First, the location is perfect. It is ideally situated with easy access to the underground trains and to the surface transportation. We loved riding the ""F"" streetcar line to the Embarcadero and Fisherman's Wharf and then the opposite direction to Castro Street. History was just everywhere!Free WiFi was excellent. Our room was cozy and very clean with a queen bed, tv, minifridge, and a wash basin in the room. All rooms shared shower rooms and water closets that were very clean and private with four of each on both floors. There is an expanded continental breakfast each morning in the breakfast room with a wide variety of foods and a local newspaper. The breakfast room is available to guests 24 hours a day. Early each evening an innkeeper serves complimentary cocktails in the sitting room. We only took advantage of this once because we were always on the go, but it is a very nice touch. One of the highlights of our stay was meeting other guests for breakfast and chatting with them and the innkeepers.We cannot wait to return to San Francisco, and you can bet we will be at The Willows!","March 20, 2016","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

549,"I was recently in San Francisco with a friend and we searched for a modest place to stay on the business/play trip to the City. We found the Willows on line and booked two rooms (none have private baths but there are plenty and super well cared for. Showers and toilet rooms are separate and rooms have skinks). It was only later while further reviewing the website that I discovered that I had been their with my husband and other family members also 40 years before. The place was much the same (it is not at all handicapped accessible and it is a steep stair case up. Even at my 70 some years, it was not that daunting). The place is filled with books and books. The staff is super helpful but that there at night. We enjoyed complimentary wine in the library one night and that was very nice. Right next door, by the way, if a Vietnamese restaurant (we French when we were there before) and it is well worth eating there. Another plus - transportation is just down and up and street. Maps are available and directions by bus and muni right on the table by the office.Breakfast is self serve and continental but it is generous with fresh breads, hard boiled eggs and loads of fruit. Good coffee too. We will go back.","January 9, 2016","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

The Willows is centrally located a few blocks outside the Castro and steps from the Muni and buses to Golden Gate Park, Embarcadero, Fisherman' Wharf, Cliff House and all parts of S.F. The Inn is on 2 floors, has a large comfortable sitting room filled with books, tv, movies and during their daily cocktail hour, interesting people. Each day we had a large healthy breakfast in their sunny breakfast room & had great conversations with people from Chile, Portugal, Santa Fe and N.Y. The 3 owners have decorated the Inn beautifully and keep it spotless. Our room was spacious & comfortable. Each room has a sink but the bathrooms & showers (2 of each on both floors) are in the hallway. I was concerned this would be a problem but in our 10 day stay, I never had to wait for the facilities.

559,"I spent three nights at the Willows B&B. Its location at Church & Market Streets makes it only steps away from the Muni, and a short walk away from Castro Street. The place is very affordable, and the area is a nice change from the crowded downtown Union Square hotels.I stayed in a two-room suite with another couple. In retrospect, I would have preferred to book two separate rooms, because I had to pass through their room in order to use the bathroom and shower down the hall. The two-room suite would be perfect for family members, but it was a little tight for two couples.That said, the place was very clean, and I never had to wait to use the bathroom or shower rooms. Each bathroom and shower was private and clean. During office hours, I noticed that a staff member went in to each shower after its use and made sure to freshen the room. Nice touch.The continental breakfast was also nice, although the room could be a little crowded. The place was very quiet, as well. My only small gripe was that the pillows on the bed were flat as a pancake. I'd advise them to get new pillows soon! Otherwise, I highly recommend the Willows if you don't mind the shared bathrooms situation and a steep stairway to the guest rooms. NOTE: I'd request a third floor room next time, because the bathrooms upstairs are much brighter because of the skylights.","July 30, 2015","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

Normaly i prefer more modern places but in this victorian building it all fits very well. All staff i extremly friendly and professional. Allways some good advice... restaurants...places to go etc. Breakfast is served in a little kitchen with a ""join me table"" Every more you can meet fresh fruit, cereals and very nice and interesting people. A gread place for singles to stay as there is always a chat in the morning. Shared bathroom is normaly a ""no go"" for me but willows tought me other. The 4 Bathrooms are always perfectly clean. I never ever experienced any problem. Its almost magic ... how do you do this guys?. I stayed in one of the smaller rooms. Good Bed, big fridge, and very good Value for money. Location close to market castro... and a huge safeway across the street.","June 23, 2015","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

564,"As my daughter lives in the Castro, we wanted to stay in the area during our stay in the city. So we chose the Willows Inn. Good choice, I have to say. We were received very friendly, our room with two beds was conveniently sized and adequately equipped (but only had a rather small window on an alley, where there can be some noise at night). The beds were very comfortable. Everyhing is meticulously clean and the people there are very helpful. Bathroom facilities are shared. Although that never caused an issue (keeping in mind that the inn did not seem to be very busy at the time), that is the only thing I did not like about the place. We didn't eat breakfast there as our European systems need another type of coffee in the morning, so we can't judge that one. Fair prices!","March 29, 2015","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

566,"The Willows is a friendly, clean and homely B&B. From the outside it looks small, but looks can be deceiving as inside this is a large two storey dwelling. Staff are friendly and on hand should you require anything. Bathroom facilities are shared, but this was never a problem for us, so you shouldn't worry about this. Continental Breakfast was plentiful and had a nice selection of fruits, cereals, yogurts and breads. Likewise Tea, Coffee, Milk and Juices are all provided, and they even wash the dishes for you. The only problem we encountered was with noise at the rear of the property where our room was based. We booked the 2 bedroom suite and this room sits next to a large fan from the restaurant below the B&B. The droning of the fan/exhaust stopped me getting an early night on the first night we arrived. The fan eventually gets switched off around 11pm. So if you're noise sensitive, I would avoid this room, which is a shame because it's a great room otherwise. Overall we had a great stay and would definitely return. However we would choose another room away from the restaurant below. ","January 8, 2015","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

The Inn was super clean and the guys were so friendly, and the breakfast was the best I've ever had for a self-serve. They had so many options and the best fruit and yogurt! I loved that we could make tea at night or get juice and not have to bother anyone.We didn't have a car and took public transit everywhere (buses, trolleys, subways, and cable car). We had no problem getting around. The Inn is perfectly situated so that you can get anywhere reasonably fast. We found an amazing breakfast spot around the corner (Duboce Park Cafe) and were right next door to Safeway where we could buy lunch for our day trips. Ice cream is just up the street and ample places to eat at night. The nightlife is fun and only a few blocks away but the Inn is quiet enough that you don't notice the hustle and bustle.Overall, a 10!","December 3, 2014","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

The location is fantastic and the rooms homely rather than stuffy or sterile. A good choice of foods for breakfast each morning as well as teas and coffees available throughout the day.

If shared shower and toilet facilities scare you off, don’t be. They were immaculate (probably a lot cleaner than mine at home). The breakfast wasn't fancy but more than enough to get you to a good start before exploring the city. Special thanks to Mike for shipping back the jacket that I left behind.

Mark was very helpful and accomodating. From the minute we got there, it was apparent the hotel was excellent. Little touches like ghirardelli chocolate, magazines to read, happy hour with free drinks, a binder with local menus, muni passes for sale, and an innkeeper on staff to provide concierge service made our stay enjoyable. We were pleasanly surprised at the quality of breakfast provided. We expected muffin and juice.

572,"Willows Inn was an ideal base for my recent week long visit to SF. Conveniently situated just off Market Street with easy access to Metro and street car transport and in an area packed with cafes and a nearby branch of Wholefoods, this was a great find. I stayed on what the Americans call the 3rd floor (2nd for us Brits) and my room (like the place In general) was cosily furnished, a trifle old fashioned perhaps, but a pleasure to stay in. The wifi works, the communal kitchen/breakfast room is stocked with juices, fruit, yogurt and teas ideal for a late night return if you are peckish - lovely. There are books on the landings and in the sitting room which is a nice touch in these gadget obsessed days. Very tasteful indeed. The cocktail hour between 6 and 7pm is a great way to meet other guests, though my busy sightseeing schedule meant that I only got to it 2 or 3 times during the week. Friendly and helpful hosts too.  Altogether I was very pleased with my choice.","September 18, 2014","9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

Staff were friendly and helpful, and rates were reasonable, especially given how expensive San Francisco is. Great location, too. My only complaint would be that there were no hot items at breakfast, which Bed and Breakfast usually implies there will be. Still, overall just a great experience. 41 y/o mother/wife: Great location for a very reasonable price. We really enjoyed our two-room suite. The staff were helpful and attentive. It was quiet, by and large, for the city.13 y/o daughter: This place was awesome. The rooms were nice and clean and the beds were comfortable. There wasn't a lot of noise from the street, which was really nice. Everything in there just gave off the feel that it had been done very thoughtfully.

It does have a somewhat older appearance, which is slightly daunting at first; however, the room and bathroom, although small, were clean, and the sheets appeared to be newer. The staff was also very helpful- the general manager sat down with me the first day we arrived, after we checked in, and gave me a map and drew out all of the bus routes we might need during our visit, and showed me how to buy tickets on the Muni app. Other staff also booked a shuttle for us to go back to the airport, since we did not have a rental car.

We stayed twice in SF, once without a car and once with so this property is ideal for those needing a car spot. Its a no frills kind of place and in a very expensive city, its room price is what you expect for the location.Staff are friendly and a approachable and willing t help and advise. Breakfast is included - its low key but meets all needs. The breakfast room is small but people don't tend to linger so just wait for long enough and you'll get a spot. Rooms are clean, the bed is big (which makes the room small!) but its comfortable and has everything you need. There's a great pizza place and a supermarket just next door and the Presidio is a lovely place to walk.Now to the ""be aware"" point. I am not used to lodging places that are so dog friendly, we had three in a row in our stay. This is not the norm in Australia and I am not keen. The room next door had two very large dogs, one a German Shepherd and one something else. One barked some time after 10pm when it wanted to go out. It did the same thing at 4am. It didn't bark for long but then in a small place it only takes one or two barks to wake everyone around it up. It did about 4 or 5 before its owner managed to quiet it -4 or 5 barks are very loud in the room next door at 4am. The future learning point for me is to find out how dog friendly my accommodation is and make my choice accordingly.","July 1, 2019","10    Travelodge by Wyndham Presidio San Francisco

We did not have a problem getting a spot as we came and went. The free parking appealed to me as I did not want to incur any extra costs on top of the hotel per night cost.Staff: Absolutely wonderful, helpful, pleasant. Raymond the manager was fantastic for city recommendations. He knew his stuff about the city and genuinely enjoyed sharing his knowledge and helping you out and plan your day. We also had multiple rooms for a few nights and the staff was great to accommodate different people coming/going at different times, charging different credit cards, putting rooms near each other, etc.Room: The room was very basic accommodations, clean and comfortable. Don’t expect luxury, but you’ll have everything you need for a good night’s sleep. Some rooms seemed a bit smaller than others so space was a little tight, but we were literally using the rooms just to sleep so it was exactly what we needed.Breakfast: Having a small selection of breakfast goodies with coffee each morning was a nice bonus to rely on each morning before we headed out.Overall, I think this is a great hotel for the value we paid. While not the fanciest hotel, it’s a great budget option with a few hidden amentities that really made it worth it for me and my friends.","November 15, 2018","10    Travelodge by Wyndham Presidio San Francisco

We were quickly settled in. The next morning when we went down to breakfast their was a manager there that was extremely helpful answering questions and even took us in to an office and outlined a route we needed for later in the day getting back to the hotel. The staff also allowed us access to a microwave later in the evening to warm up some food. In the afternoon they had hot chocolate and cookies available. Much appreciated! The hotel itself was very basic and a place to sleep which was all we were looking for. There is a deli and pizza place just down the block. We also were able to walk to a Walgreens that was several blocks away. The neighborhood seemed fairly safe, although there was loud voices outside our room one night. We later learned someone had wondered onto the property and the police had to be called because they were knocking on doors and wouldn't leave. We did feel safe while we were there. Overall, the staff made our stay comfortable and went above and beyond on what that did for us!","November 11, 2018","10    Travelodge by Wyndham Presidio San Francisco

The Travelodge is located a little bit away from Fisherman’s Wharf however is about an hour walk to the Golden Gate Bridge. The parking lot is relatively small and you are not guaranteed a space in the lot as there are more rooms than spaces. However, upon arrival, a staff member rushed out to make sure we could find a parking spot. If there are no spots in the lot, they help you park on the street which is free. The outside isn’t much to look at (as another reviewer put it) but don’t let that fool you. Once you’re in the room, it’s clean, spacious and great for a night stay in San Fransisco.

About the hotel, it's cleaned, compliment breakfast in the morning. Have little snacks and coffee available during daytime. Little issue is not enough parking, you may need to park on the street. Also the air conditioner inside the room is bit noisy when it's on. Somehow it affects me to sleep.

618,"Oh, where do I start? I was literally impressed from check-in to check-out. I’m a person who is very big on customer service. This hotel staff from the front desk to maintenance/housekeeping knocked it out of the park!! When I was planning my San Francisco trip, I was blown away by the cost of a lot of the hotels. Typically, I stay at hotels within the Hilton network when I’m on an extended vacation and hotels that fall within the Wyndham network for one night stays. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a hotel because I planned to spend money elsewhere so I decided on this hotel because of the online reviews and the fact that parking was free unlike many of the other hotels. Our flight arrived way ahead of the check-in time (9:15 AM) to be exact BUT the staff was willing to accommodate us with an early check-in. My husband was given recommendations on where to eat and he even got a map of San Francisco that outlined the location of various attractions. Again, customer service was nothing like I had ever experienced at my usual 4 star hotels. I tip my hat off to the management here because it is apparent that EXCEPTIONAL customer service is a requirement at this establishment. For example, I left my suitcase by the stairs and I think the guy was the manager, he brought the suitcase up the stairs and to my room door. I thought that was so nice of him because he probably saw that I needed help and he jumped right in to help. So, this is my honest review of this hotel and keep in mind that I am hard to please. 1st, customer service is EXCEPTIONAL. 2nd, the location is within a 2-4 mile radius of everything that you may want to do in San Francisco. 3rd, parking is free but the parking spots are limited (TIP: Park your car after check-out and use Lyft/Uber/BART to get where you want to go it’s not expensive. That’s what we did for some stuff. On the other hand, you can avoid a car all together.) 4th, BART runs right in front of the hotel. 5th, this hotel is NOT rundown as stated by the person in the previous post. This is coming from a picky person. It has that old San Francisco charm like a lot of the other buildings in San Francisco. 6th, the hotel is located in a safe area. 7th, the hotel has a good continental breakfast, 8th, the rooms are nice, clean, and spacious. They also have a nice size fridge and a microwave. The beds are very, very comfy. I definitely will stay here again on my return visit. The service that I received here surpassed any service that I have received at a Hilton. Please don’t be deterred by the fact that it’s a Travelodge and rated a 2 Star because it does not paint a true picture of the quality of this hotel. Lastly, if you are staying at the Travelodge like I, chances are the other hotels were out of your price range so don’t get on here trying to bash this hotel when you know that this was all that you could afford. Your hopes shouldn’t be as high knowing that this is a 2 Star hotel. I personally didn’t know what to expect but I was on a budget and I didn’t want to break the bank. However, it worked out perfectly for me because it surpassed my expectations. ","April 6, 2018","10    Travelodge by Wyndham Presidio San Francisco

Bus (#45) around corner from motel (Lyon St) takes you down Union St (many shops and restaurants), then over Russian Hill to North Beach (base of Telegraph Hill), through China Town and finally to Union Square. For seniors the bus is $1.35 and you get a 90 minute transfer. The 300+ Lyon St steps just a few blocks away are a popular exercise area for younger persons (we climb them once a trip).

Buses, shops and restaurants are only a 5 min walk away. The hotel is in a very safe neighbourhood. The hotel staff (Ray and Bob) are very kind and friendly and eager to assist you to enjoy your stay. They are very knowledgable on the local area for buses and places to visit, etc and worth talking too. The cost of the rooms include unlimited continental breakfasts always a bonus for hungry family. two Petrol stations are about 1/2 min from the hotel. I would highly receommend this hotel as a base for SFO. The hotel has been awarded several recommended hotel awards from 2010 to date and I can totally see why.

This boutique B and B consists of two houses close to Castro with peaceful gardens, a bright breakfast room and lovely sitting room with a fire and a decanter of brandy. The room was fine with a comfortable bed and excellent linen. But it was the people who made it for us. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful and we met some fascinating fellow guests at the wine social each evening with nibbles and bottles of local red and white to sample. There's a tram stop at the bottom of the road and - once you master the public transportation system - it's not difficult to get downtown and to the parks and museums. Two minor quibbles. The quality of the breakfast and wine social nibbles seemed to depend on who was on duty. One morning's buffet breakfast featured a very poor selection compared to the usual big bowl of fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, toast, yoghurt and very decent coffee. And don't try and walk from the BART station with heavy bags. Take a taxi. Apart from those very minor issues, we couldn't recommend this more.","May 29, 2019","11    Parker Guest House

638,"Parker House is in the heart of SanFrancisco, with the trolley stop one bock away. Easy access to the transportation system. The property is actually two old houses that have been converted to a great bed and breakfast. Has a backyard with comfortable places to sit and chill out. Breakfasts are served buffet style, all you can eat. Wine and cheese hour every afternoon. Just a few blocks from the famous Castro district and a short walk to Market Street where you can catch a bus to downtown, Fisherman's Wharf, the Ferry Building where you can board the ferry toSasalito. We've already reserved for this coming fall again. Reserve early- it's affordable (for San Francisco) so it fills up early.","May 7, 2019","11    Parker Guest House

641,"My husband and I enjoyed 2 great nights. I have read some of the previous reviews regarding the room and the reception (friendliness) during their stay. Yes the corner room may be a bit noisier - but it is the city, and a city that is well known to have trolleys and other traffic that is noisy. Personally I think it is not unexpected to have noise. A recommendation is to either bring ear plugs (they are cheap to buy reusable ones) for staying in cities or other multi-use places (like hostels, Airbnb, hotels, etc) - or have available at the front desk for individuals requiring them. I did not have an issue with the noise. The bed was very comfortable. We were also very impressed with breakfast options: there was a wonderful selection of choices including fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt, hot porridge, coffee and other options. I was quite pleased with this, as I had not expected this wide of selection and had not mentioned a dietary restriction of no gluten. The fresh fruit, yogurt and coffee were great for me. Staff was friendly. All areas were well cared for and clean. The outdoor area was beautiful and well cared for as well. As far as heterosexuals not feeling welcome - this surprises me. We felt very welcome and comfortable there. We were sad that they didn't have availability for an additional night! We decided at the last minute to stay another night in San Francisco and it unfortunately didn't work out to stay another night. The place was quite interesting and beautiful, with all the woodwork that was well maintained.","March 29, 2019","11    Parker Guest House

651,"I recently stayed at the Parker guest house for the second time, and I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Firstly, it has a great location, being just a few minutes walk from the Castro area with great Cafes, restaurants and funky shops and bars. I've always felt it is a safe area to walk around and the area has a great atmosphere. Secondly, while the Parker is not located in the middle of downtown, it is only a short trip downtown, and I'd rather have the better location and atmosphere! There is a Muni stop right at the door, several lines run to the Castro, there is the heritage trolley car, as well as buses and Ubers. And it's only a 15 minute level walk to the Bart station if you want to take the train to SFO. And most importantly, staying at the Parker really feels like a home away from home. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and the living room areas are really nice to sit and read or work, especially in front of the open fire in winter! The breakfast room is filled with light and I've met some amazing people to talk to over breakfast. After a long day in the city, it really does feel like coming home. And the staff are just amazing. So if you have a chance to come to SF, stay here. You won't regret it.","February 17, 2019","11    Parker Guest House

664,"First let me say, Great Staff!!! The Parker Guesthouse is a real gem in San Fransisco. The guesthouse is two properties next to each other with a courtyard in between. The grounds are nice and on nice days you can have a relaxing afternoon or evening. The staff here is friendly and if you need anything they try to help you. Wine is served from 5:30-6:30 each evening and offers a nice opportunity to meet fellow guests and travelers. We met several nice couples each night. In the lobby sitting room a decanter of brandy is always available and provides a wonderful opportunity to meet people. We have come down each night and have met some very nice people and enjoyed the evenings. I can't say anything wrong about the guesthouse. I can't say enough about this place, trams are out the door and a block away or if you want another one it is 5 blocks easy walk. Restaurants are all around again within just a few blocks. Again I found this to be a real gem. I have seen the reviews and met the people who stay here and many have been coming here and staying for years. I think that in its self says a lot.

The staff are brilliant and go to great lengths to be welcoming. I was travelling alone and it was really nice to be treated like a friend. The breakfast menu was substantial and had a wide variety of food items - from cereals, muffins, bagels to fresh fruit, yoghurt and coffee. The service was excellent - menu items were replenished as soon as they were running low.The room I stayed in had a great corner aspect - with two windows looking out onto Church Street. It was a bit noisy with the tram going past, but I consider that part of the charm of San Francisco. I got used to it pretty quickly. My room was attended to every day - and it was nice to get some Parker dark chocolates in my room when I returned at night. A nice touch.I chose the Parker at random when I was booking my stay - and it was the best decision.Thanks to all the staff at The Parker Guest House for helping to make my stay in San Francisco FANTASTIC.I’ll DEFINITELY be back!

667,"Fantastic little hotel in a perfect location in San Francisco. Their pre-visit communication was great. I read that there were two buildings so I requested that our daughter's room was close to ours and when we arrived she was just across the hall from us. The rooms are very nicely furnished. There are two buildings - originally two neighbouring residential homes - which share a lovely patio garden. They are very organised and had very good systems in place with very nice touches such as fresh brew coffee in the second house's kitchen if residents there didn't want to go across to the breakfast room. The breakfast was great - 'continental' but definitely sufficient, with plentiful baked goods, fresh juice and fruit, oatmeal and yogurt and coffee and tea of course. It didn't bother us but the only drawback I could envisage for anyone considering booking would be the number of stairs; there are quite a few up and down between the houses and accessing the main building. The staff are absolutely lovely and will assist with luggage etc but it's not ideal if you have any real mobility issues. The location of this place is also great; you can get on and off the yellow J line from just up the road on Church Street and the J line takes you into the main centre of town and access to all other lines so we bought a 3-day clipper card from Walgreens and went everywhere by tram. It's also only about a 10 minute walk from The Castro area and we also walked from here to Mission, which was a bit further but not too bad. The ubers are also very reliable and cheap here though. Overall this was a great choice and a perfect end to a great vacation. And we will definitely stay here again if we go back to SF.","October 12, 2018","11    Parker Guest House

Although the trolley runs up and down Church, we didn't find the noise to be a problem (we enjoyed hearing it pass, in fact).Those who think they might be bothered should request a room in the back.The trolley is actually a great reason to stay at The Parker; just steps from the front door,it can take you directly or by transfer to just about every corner of town.We enjoyed the breakfasts, which we shared each morning with an international clientele (visitors from Germany, Spain and Australia while we were there.) Afternoon wine and snacks was a plus.When we left after four nights (we really didn't want to) we were even given farewell hugs by the staff!Can't wait to get back to San Francisco--and The Parker.","September 30, 2018","11    Parker Guest House

670,"It was our first trip to California and it began with four nights in San Francisco at the The Parker Guest House, before heading on down the coast. We wanted to stay in a location with more of a feel for the real San Francisco and not just the touristy side. The Parker Guest House was perfect. Within walking distance of Castro and Mission District with many shops and restaurants and so close to Market Street. The staff greeted us and showed us around the property and to our room. I would like to say that we felt the staff were very professional, friendly and made you feel comfortable from the minute you met them. Our room was in the building adjacent to the main house. After reading some reviews about noise along the street, I specifically asked for a room in the back when I made our reservation. We had Room 40 on the 3rd or 4th floor (depending on which door you entered from) with private bath in the back section of the building and it was perfectly quite. The room was a bit small but it accommodated us fine. Ample space in the bathroom and it was very clean. No elevator so be prepared to walk up stairs. The cleaning staff always did an exceptional job of keeping the room neat and tidy. The bed was very comfortable with quality linens and pillows. There was a small kitchen area in the front of our building where you could make coffee or tea. It had a refrigerator and we left an unopened bottle of champagne in it for a couple of days and no one bothered it. We walked over to the main house for breakfast in the mornings and a couple of afternoons we stopped in for the wine and cheese social. It was nice meeting and talking to people from different countries and states. And the outside grounds were great. With the private gazebo, fruit trees and fountain. They had private parking for our car (which was a little tight) but very secure. The hotel was completely secure. You had to have a key to enter the grounds/property. We enjoyed the city (except for the crazy drivers) and we opted to take Uber for the most part. We walked around the neighborhood and really enjoyed the feel of the area. Be sure to check out the Clarion Alley Mural Project. It was fantastic! We drove ourselves around exploring the city one day and drove over to Muir Woods, Stinson Beach and Sausalito another day, but you should get familiar with their traffic laws first! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here would definitely choose The Parker Guest House again on our next visit.","September 16, 2018","11    Parker Guest House

671,"We stayed at Parker Guest House with our two daughters at the start of our mini-tour in California. We arrived from the U.K. after a long flight but right from the outset we were made to feel right at home. That for us was the best thing about our stay; the hospitality. It was faultless. That’s not to say there was anything wrong with its location; in fact that was ideal too; right on the J Line and only a few blocks from BART and the historic streetcars on the F Line. It was lovely to escape the crowds and live like a local. No shortage of places to eat and drink locally either. That said, after the amazing breakfast of fresh fruits, yoghurts, pastries, bagels etc it was a while before we needed anything! At the other end of the day, the wine social was a great way to start the evening.The main guest house building where we stayed is a 1907 building with plenty of features and character. The only slightly adverse comment I would make about our stay is that in our downstairs rooms (20 and 21) we heard footsteps from the public lounge area above at around 5am which seemed a bit early. That said, this is still absolutely a 5* establishment and this was only a very minor thing.We look forward to having an opportunity to return to Parker Guest House.","September 8, 2018","11    Parker Guest House

672,"Greetings! Our son recently moved to San Francisco.This was our first visit and we wanted to stay near his apartment. Although this is billed as a guest house, I would consider it more like a boutique hotel.We were bummed when he moved from NY city,as there were so many cool hotels in the area. But we found a gem in San Fran! The Parker guest house probably has around 30 rooms. The home is beautiful as are the rooms. We stayed in 2 separate rooms,neither in the main building,and they were both clean,nicely appointed,with up-scale toiletries,water pitcher and chocolate.They were also able to accommodate our daughter with a rollaway bed. There is a lovely wine hour in the evening with snacks, and breakfast is provided. There seemed to always be coffee and sweets available in the kitchen.We loved all the areas to relax.... the beautiful den with fire place and brandy available,all the cute little sitting areas outside! I believe I sipped coffee or wine in every outdoor space!! You must see the beautifully landscaped back yard to believe it! Being from Baltimore, I was amazed by the lemon and apple trees! Having traveled all over the world, and being a self proclaimed"" hotel snob"", This property can hold its own against any luxury hotel. What stood out the most was the staff!! Kind without being phony,professional without being too formal or stuffy. They were always ready to chat,answer any questions ,and help in any way possible. Scot was the best,as was the young gentleman who worked during the day and the lady at the front desk( I'm sorry I don't remember their names)!! I have found my home away from home when I go visit my son! If you have the opportunity to stay here,do it, you are in for a treat! Cheers and happy travels!

674,"This was our third visit to this brilliantly located guesthouse and we were disappointed. Previously we have stayed in the main house in two different, lovely rooms. Both rooms had a decent amount of space and were really nice places to be. This time, however, we were housed in the second building across the garden and our room (Room 35) was extremely small. To move around the bed we had to negotiate past our suitcases as there was no way to put them out of the way. There was not even room for a solitary chair. The bathroom was a good size and was fine. Perhaps we had been given complimentary upgrades on our previous visits but we presumed that all their rooms were of that standard. We would not have paid the high price to stay in the little room we were given had we realised that the Parker Guesthouse had rooms like that. The bath was not clean when we arrived and did not appear to be cleaned during our four day stay. Getting out of the bath with other people’s long hairs clinging to your body is not good. The wine social was fun and is a generous addition to a stay at this place. The continental breakfast offers a lovely selection of pastries, bagels, toast, eggs, cereals and yoghurts. Very good. This guesthouse is perfectly located as the J line is just outside and The Castro is a short stroll up the road. The staff is friendly, the garden pretty and the building is gorgeous. Our two previous visits made this one of our favourite places in the world to stay. This time, however, was a disappointment on a number of levels. We will probably look for an alternative when we visit this great neighbourhood next year as we don’t want to pay $250+ per night for a room that is too small to be comfortable.","August 30, 2018","11    Parker Guest House

We booked the King Deluxe Room was clean and good sized, no air con and we had to prop a window open with a book to get some air circulating. Staff were great and extremely welcoming and helpful with local knowledge and advice. Garden area was very nice to relax in. Negatives - trams pass by and can be quite loud, if your a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Breakfast - simple but basic, if your staying more than two / three days would be a bit repetitive. No tea/coffee making facility in room, although available in the kitchen, first thing in the morning having to traipse downstairs in your nightie to get a morning cuppa was a pain.

A bit larger than a B and B, it still had the charm and personal service that one receives in smaller accommodations. Staff was engaging and helpful, rooms were immaculate and location was just ideal for me. I was visiting a new granddaughter and it was a nice walk to where I had to go. My only issue is that it would have been ideal if they had a mini-fridge and coffeemaker in case one wanted a late night glass of wine , yes, coffee or soft drink—- or needed to store meds that need refrigeration.

Great to see a lady on the front desk too this time. The staff are so welcoming and friendly. The rooms are well appointed and it’s the small touches that make this palace a delight to stay at. Definitely one of my favorite places in the world to stay. It does appear to be becoming more mainstream though and less and less gay guests over the years. Not sure if I was imagining this though as that would be a shame. Didn’t see a pride flag - but I could have missed it. Great to see the guest house is so popular among travelers.

684,"Located a block off of Union Square, the Donatello was a perfect base of operations for a week in San Francisco. The 1970s ('80s?) concrete exterior did not prepare us for the large, beautiful (and recently updated) room. Staff were welcoming and helpful at every point. As timeshare owners with another organization, we found a number of things that exceeded what we get with our membership (e.g., daily maid service and evening events in the club lounge). We talked to non-member guests who were equally happy with the choice of staying there. The Donatello will be our choice for suture trips to the city.","July 12, 2019","12    The Donatello

686,"I had stayed at this hotel/timeshare about 10 years ago. Rooms have been updated since then, and we had a fairly large, comfortable room on the 7th floor, (king sized bed, pull out sofa, desk, chairs, small mini kitchen area, and nice sized bathroom). Bed was comfortable and plenty of space to unpack, (large closet area w/ shelf space), for our week long stay. Plenty of counter space in bathroom, and fully stocked w/ towels. Water pressure was a bit weak at times, but nothing to complain about. Wifi was free and no problem w/ connecting, (although we did have to put in the password everyday). Never a wait for elevators, and staff was friendly. Only downside was how long it took the Wyndham rep to finally accept that we WERE NOT interested in attending the presentation. (I started off w/ a polite, ""no thanks, not interested""...and finally had to say a firm ""No"", and just walk away.)The hotel is in a great location---a block or two from Union Square, and close to a variety of bus/trolley routes, as well as BART. We bought a week long MUNI pass, ($45), good for cable car, bus and trolley. We did not use the Powell Street cable car, as the wait was always LONG.....but did take several rides on the California cable car, (never a wait/never crowded). We found several good pubs/cafes in the area. We did go to the rooftop lounge to relax & read the paper.....but mainly spent our days touring this beautiful city. The Donatello has a great central location, yet isn't in the midst of all the crowds. Highly recommend.","July 3, 2019","12    The Donatello

Of note, we were in a club room and would not even have known this was a timeshare if I hadn’t read reviews to that effect here. We never saw or heard from any individual trying to sell us a timeshare.

The cable cars are a great way to get around the city and you can buy a one or two day pass. Don't miss Fisherman's Wharf, a tour of Alcatraz, and a free tour of the Cable Car Museum.

It was a careful selection and a hotel I was really looking forward to staying in. Check In was laboured due to being passed over to the concierge to introduce Wyndham properties which after a 10 hour trip was unneeded. No mention of the reason for our stay, let alone upgrades or gifts we had received in most other Cities. The room was nice, but nothing impressive and the pre visit photos had been carefully taken to suggest a bigger room than it was actually was, and clear to see why no pictures of the bathroom were posted. No enquires when we left as to our stay and only the concierge and bell boys wished us a safe trip. Overall, a good hotel in a great location but I’m sure better value for money to be had at almost $350 a night. ","June 8, 2019","12    The Donatello

693,"Our usual San Francisco hotel wasn't available for the dates we were there, but we found a great deal for the Donatello and decided to take the chance. I'm glad we did! First, a week before our stay, I received a phone call from a concierge asking if there we had any special requests. I said no, just a quiet room--the view wasn't important.Honestly, the hotel isn't much to look at from the outside; its a tall piece of 1960's concrete Brutalism dropped in the middle of historic Union Square buildings. But the interior is another story. The lobby is small but easy to navigate, and the front desk person had us checked in (early) within five minutes. They turned us over the concierge who gave us a rundown on current events and a discount book, plus a low-pressure pitch for ""Club Donatello"", which I gather is a reserved time-share type of arrangement on the hotel's top floor. When we told her we weren't interested she let it go.The room (a king) was large for San Francisco and the bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows (a big plus since we like reading in bed). There was a kitchenette area with a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and its own sink, plus a full set of dinnerware, plates and bowls, plus dish washing liquid and a sponge. An alcove held a closet with bi-fold doors and a chest of drawers plus the luggage rack, so it was all out of the way. The long desk made a nice place to eat. There are power outlets and USB charging ports on all lamps and built into the desk.The bathroom, though small, was spotless (a big deal to me) and the shower was roomy with plenty of water pressure. The room was cleaned very efficiently early in the day, so after a long day of walking The City we came back to a freshly cleaned room. All of the staff were friendly and helpful.As someone who has visited SF regularly for 25 years, the Donatello is someplace I'd definitely consider again.","June 5, 2019","12    The Donatello

Hotel should inform us of the renovation during booking so we may choose another hotel.During check in, the senior lady staff is more interested in getting us to attend timeshare selling session. She also try promoting us to a list of restaurants which she even mentioned she can earn commission (if we eat there). After a full day in the road, we just want to get our room and rest.Despite being informed we are 3 guests during booking. Bed for 3rd guest was never set up.

711,"I was a little nervous that this time share hotel room would be too small for a couple and our 6 foot teenager, but it was just perfect. Immaculately clean, spacious, nicely appointed and with possibly the best king-sized bed we’ve ever had.The location is terrific for visiting all around SF. Within walking distance is Chinatown, Union Square, Westfield, the Business District and the cable car turnaround. Heaps of good restaurants and cafes, Walgreens for grocery and pharmacy goods, Starbucks and self serve or drop-off laundromats. The only negative was the anticipated time-share hard sell. Not only did they grab us during checkin to push the “free breakfast” and sales push, we were called twice on the first night by the concierge urging us to take them up on the offer. The second call was at 8:30pm - after we’d been asleep for over an hour due to our international flight.This practise needs to stop, as it just detracts from an otherwise perfect hotel experience.A note re the homeless situation in SF: this hotel was well situated with very few homeless people or panhandlers around. You will see them though where ever you go in SF and it’s shameful so many people have to live like this in such an affluent country","December 15, 2018","12    The Donatello

716,"We have been here two times in about three years and both times we had very nice rooms and fine service. Except to the obligatory sales pitch from the time share salesperson, checking in would have been very quick. I realize that the salesperson has a sales quota, but applying pressure to attend an orientation is not the right thing to do when the travellers have spent much time to get to this destination and may be in need to get to their rooms. They will not take a ""not interested"" at this point and continue the pitch when they must realize that their target will probably be a no-show or turn down any offer made.The room was very clean and we liked the service bar that had a microwave oven and a full-sized coffee maker, seldom seen with single server machines used in so many hotels, and real plates and cutlery. There was also a small service sink that could be used in rinsing out dishes and for filling up the coffee maker. The bath room was very ample and there were plenty of towels. We were up around the sixth floor and it was very quiet considering the usual city noises.The car valet service worked like a charm and the parking rate was reasonable. One can find independent garages via internet parking service sites, but many of the ones close to the hotel were cheaper but did not have in-and-out privileges. The location is very good for downtown and it was close to the restaurants we had planned to visit and shopping was about two or three blocks away.We will return to this hotel, but would be a lot happier if I could somehow bypass that timeshare sales desk the next time back and give the hotel a higher rating.","November 16, 2018","12    The Donatello

Our room on the 11th floor was clean spacious quiet and had everything we needed while 2 floors above was a comfortable rooftop lounge where you can take your own drinks or take advantage of the complementary tea coffee and hot chocolate on offer. There are also leisure facilities on this floor with a sauna spa and small gym.

The area around Union Square has plenty to offer and is a safe and pleasant environment, with most forms of transport close by. The hotel was very presentable, and everything functioned as it should. Our room on the 9th floor was very spacious and clean, looking out to the rear and hence largely unaffected by traffic noise. The staff were universally pleasant and helpful, and we appreciated being able to take advantage of the hospitality facilites on the 14th floor.That said, there were a couple of downsides: the sales pitch for the timeshare group (of which the hotel is part) was unwelcome on arrival, as our body clocks were at the middle of the night after our transatlantic flight. Also, the on-site restaurant was overly expensive for what was simply decent quality Italian food - maybe a reason why there is no menu in the room other than room service!","October 7, 2018","12    The Donatello

We were in the regular hotel part on the 10th floor, and our other family members were in the Club Donatello section on the 11th floor. Our room was a little bigger than theirs, and we had a table and chairs which they did not. The rooms were large with great views of the city. The staff were so accommodating in every way. The bathroom was a little small compared to the overall room size, but we were very comfortable and were happy to have the kitchenette with small fridge, microwave, sink, and countertop space with dishes and silverware. They also provided dish soap and sponge. We had a unique parking need because we were in a big SUV with a small luggage hitch attachment on the back. They had two oversized parking spaces right outside the front door for this situation and did not charge us anything additional (parking is $35/day, which is reasonable for San Francisco hotels). The front desk staff was very friendly, and the concierge gave us helpful information on the area and a city map. The best part: the lounge on the 15th floor! It had a small self-serve coffee/tea/water area, tables and chairs, a fireplace, and nice views of the city as well as doors to an outer patio area for some fresh air and closer look at the views.

The Hollywood Cafe across the street was yummy and is a better choice than the breakfast at the restaurant downstairs. The valet was $60/night but everywhere else was pretty pricy too. They have area near the lobby with games such as ping pong table and a few others games. A staff closed it up early at 8 pm indicating they have an event the next day but saw that it was actually 2 days later. The room was packed with guests playing the games and waiting to go see the fireworks on July 4th.

Valet was a little steep at $59/night, but that's SF. Valet also offers in/out privileges.","June 26, 2019","13    Hyatt Centric Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco

750,"This is my first time at the Hyatt Centric San Francisco and the location at Fisherman’s Wharf was perfect. Walking distance to attractions, tours, and dining options. I’m little disappointed in the service of the staff. A week before my stay, I emailed the hotel to inquire how to get to the hotel from SFO via public transportation, I didn’t get a response. I’m also a Hyatt Explorist member and I wasn’t recognized for my status or was thanked for my loyalty. While I didn’t get a room upgrade, which is upon availability, I was surprised that I didn’t get a preferred room. I was given a room on a lower level with no view, just of another side of the hotel and the roof. I didn’t feel appreciated as an elite member by the staff verbally or by room assignment. The room was modern and clean, and the hotel does have a great fitness room and pool. I hope the service will improve, but this hotel is one to consider.","June 26, 2019","13    Hyatt Centric Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco

763,"My wife and I recently visited San Francisco and chose to stay at the Hyatt Centric Fisherman’s Wharf. First off, I would advise ignoring the counsel to avoid Fisherman’s Wharf. We found it to be convenient to everything we wanted to do and it (or the starting point for it) was all in easy walking distance. The FW area is about a 30 minute or so ride from SFO. There are several other property brands within a block or two including a Marriott, Sheraton and a Holiday Inn. From outside, the building is fairly unimpressive. Everything in the area appeared to be a bit dated but in the case of the HC, nicely maintained and mildly updated. We didn't have a car but I believe parking was $60 a night and there is a resort fee of $23.The lobby is a bit cramped primarily due to its long, narrow design. There is only one lobby-level elevator to the guestrooms which can get backed up but there are more available a level below. There is a large function room in the lower lobby that had ping pong and air hockey tables in it when we were there. There is a snack/convenience store that serves coffee next to the registration desk. There is also a very nice restaurant and bar onsite.We were greeted cheerfully by the front desk staff who very pleasantly and efficiently got us on our way to the room. My elite status with Hyatt was recognized and got us an upgrade to the Executive Suite and free breakfast. General décor was nice and as with the exterior and the lobby looked to be updated and well kept. The room was huge. There were separate living and bedroom areas and a large bathroom with a double vanity. The living room had a gigantic flat screen and a sectional sofa along with a bar housing the coffee service and a mini-fridge. There were plenty of outlets, updated connections to the TV and everything was in working order. The bedroom was nice with a (slightly obstructed) view of the bay bridge. It was large and had a large flat screen TV. The bed was comfortable except for the pillows (my only real complaint with Hyatt properties). Bathroom amenities were mid- to high end, the shower had been updated and there was good water pressure.There is no lounge at this property but we enjoyed the buffet breakfast every day. Wait staff were way pleasant accommodating a few special requests and taking extraordinarily good care of us.We enjoyed eating at Scoma’s, Ghirardelli Square is a short walk and the Big Bus Center is about 3 or 4 blocks away. They are right in the middle of it all.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, will stay here again if we return and highly recommend it.","May 29, 2019","13    Hyatt Centric Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco

Got a connecting room to a king room where grandparents stayed. Everyone had clean rooms. Great housekeeping. Free big bottle of water each day we stayed. Location excellent and close to the wharf. Would stay again.Downsides, I found room pricey. With exchange was basically $500/night. Maybe its the location, not sure but staying at the Wharf seemed to be the spot for everywhere we wanted to go or any tour we had to meet. Outdoor pool lovely but since it's so windy the closer you get to the water and the wind was quite cool, we really only took advantage of the hot tub which is a max of 6 people so my family filled it up! Our room had a very loud ""tinny"" sounding heating/cooling unit. I couldn't sleep with it going at night so I had to wear my earbuds and play white noise.Didn't use room service or anything. Had no issues, so cannot comment on service that way or response times.I would stay again as I did find it very clean, but again, very pricey!!

We received excellent customer service from Luz at the front desk.The only small drawback if any, was that the free breakfast is not available unless you are considered a Globalist through the Hyatt Rewards program.

Also the safe didn’t work but they sent a tech to replace the battery rather than give me another room. After the first night I wish I had pushed harder for a new room without having to incur a fee because I noticed the following: the bathroom door was sticky and unclean and the sheets on the bed had holes in them (see picture). The bottle of water isn’t complimentary (the note states there’s a $20 room fee that covers the water—- pricey bottle of water), however they didn’t bother to replenish it after they cleaned the room the following day. I didn’t get a good night’s sleep due to the constant noise & vibrations but I didn’t know where they were coming from.

790,"Overall the property was nice. The rooms were clean and felt updated. No complaints about the stay. We were rushed while eating dinner at the restaurant on site, which is pricey. The food was okay. There is a destination charge that is added on to your stay. I don't feel like you get good value for your money with destination charge. You get 1 bottle of water and some other discounts. There was also a coupon book for the wharf that didn't have many good deals. The location of the hotel was perfect, but I would look for one that does not charge a $30 destination charge.","March 31, 2019","13    Hyatt Centric Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco

792,"Reserved a room here for 2 nights based on reviews, location to our event, and photos from their website, which are misleading. The desk clerk was extremely welcoming and helpful to me and my daughter - we were on a road trip from Tennessee to Seattle and we stopped in SF for a friend's graduation. The hotel decor was worn, but charming. I enjoy staying in small boutique hotels and liked the idea of a nice bed and breakfast, especially after a road trip of staying in chain hotels along the highway. Our room was fine, seemed clean on first inspection. Again, a bit worn. It was very hot in the room, so I turned the thermostat to a cooler temp and even cracked the window. Decided to head to the lobby for the cookies and sherry that they offer in the late afternoon. That is when I saw the first mouse run across my path.So, yes, we are in a big city in a small hotel - this did not bum me out too much, actually. We named the mouse Annie - lol. Then I looked down to see a big fake fingernail on the floor at my feet. Ugh. Oh, and another mouse. Back to the room - it had an odor of dirty feet and the comforter seemed a bit suspect. I didn't want to use it, but had no choice when the sun went down and the room turned cold. Ok, turn the thermostat up, no problem. Nothing. No heat, no cool, nothing. Not sure if it even worked. A call to the front desk indicated that nothing could be done until morning. Just to be clear, at this point, I still wasn't completely turned off by the place. I decided to take a shower to warm up - that's when I saw the mold on the shower edges. Coming back into the room from the bathroom, I looked toward the bed and saw some gross smudges on the bed skirt - right where one would wipe one's hand as they were laying in bed. Still willing to give them a chance of redemption, I thought breakfast would be nice, just like their pictures on their website. I'm no snob and certainly appreciate the included breakfast at a Hampton Inn or similar place. I know what to expect there and am not disappointed. And I got the same thing but worse, literally the same flip flop Belgian waffle maker, the same kind of stale muffins, etc. at the Queen Anne,. Breakfast was better at the Hampton Inn that I had stayed at the night before in Bakersfield. I was done - bailed on this hotel and booked a room at the Omni - for practically the same price. Best decision I could have made.","June 29, 2019","14    Queen Anne Hotel

That price was right for a Tuesday and Wednesday stay and we booked the two nights. What a neat surprise when we got inside. Unless, of course, you hate old victorian buildings and furniture. We loved it. The place had been a finishing school for young ladies in the late 1800's and early 1900's. We had a king room with fireplace and overlooking the street.

Bed impossible to sleep in, very hard, with questionable throw pillows and bedspread. Furniture worn and tatty; didn't want to trust my clothes to the dresser drawers. It was chilly but I looked in vain for a thermostat to turn up the heat - there was none. On the way to the airport, stopped in for the complimentary breakfast and left almost immediately.

802,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Queen Anne, both times for the same reason: a training conference held at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness Avenue, six fairly short blocks from this hostelry. I consider this a great secret for other conference-goers in the neighborhood, as the Queen Anne charges almost exactly half the rate at the larger hotel. Did I miss any amenities? Absolutely not. My room was on the top (fourth) floor and may have originally been used by an employee, as my ceiling had a sharp slope that probably allowed for a dormer window I couldn't see. The bed was comfortable and the well appointed bathroom roomy, with a shower that was easy to operate and provided full coverage. In addition, I was offered a full breakfast buffet--and I do mean full! Fruits, juices, cereals, hard-boiled eggs, breakfast meats, an array of breads and quite possibly more things I don't recall, were displayed attractively. I had fun creating my own light waffle in a rotating pan, and it was delicious. We guests ate in a dining room that seemed, by virtue of how it is arranged, to encourage friendly exchanges and mutual offers of help and information. During my first stay, the hotel was undergoing the final stages of refurbishment. It is now completely decorated, and charming. The employees were, without fail, friendly and helpful. During both my visits, I was allowed to leave my car in the hotel lot at no extra charge during the second day of the conference. This is no small gift in San Francisco where street parking is practically non-existent and garage parking, if spaces are available, is very expensive. A final note: I didn't give five stars because that might lead folks to expect a very polished, perhaps elegant place to stay. This is more like a charming inn or B&B.","February 16, 2019","14    Queen Anne Hotel

805,"Upon arrival Queen Anne still had extensive Christmas decorations everywhere that suited the Victorian style. Everything looked magical.Our room 415 on the 4th floor complete with peacock wallpaper was fine. We were going out the first evening, so we needed to iron clothes. The iron didn't work, neither did the night lamp. The iron was quickly exchanged, the night lamp was never exchanged. We were spending 6 days in SF at the Queen Anne. Breakfast the first morning was a disappointment. In the reception it's called an ""exclusive continental breakfast"". Check out the posted pictures. The boiled eggs were green inside. Nothing home-cooked, but cheap muesli, pastries, etc. No yogurt or healthy items. Bananas got more and more rotten along the way. We ended up having breakfast other places even though breakfast was included.We asked the concierge for assistance booking a table for 5 for our last evening. She didn't get through on the phone 5 days before we wanted the reservation and never followed up. We ended up walking to Octavia 1 block away and made the reservation ourselves. One of the last evenings while sitting in the impressive living room by the fireplace, at least one mouse turned up and ran around the room. This was addressed to the receptionist, who jotted down my name. The next morning I also mentioned it, where the receptionists reaction was ""this is a first time "". This attitude combined with lack of cleanliness (staircase wasn't vacuumed during our 6 days stay even though I addressed it after 3 days) was the last drop. Therefore the rating 2.

The lounge area was a nice place to sit as alternative to being in the room and there’s tea and coffee available at all times. The location is great for people who don’t want to be around the more touristy areas of union square or wharf - central for getting to different parts of SF.

There are plenty of places to eat around there including the famous Tommy's Joynt, Miller's Rest, Lemoncello and the amazing Brenda's French Soul Food.

811,"I was looking so forward to our stay in a true Victorian Painted Lady in San Francisco...I was quite disappointed, this Lady has truly seen better days. I know the age and ongoing upkeep can be daunting on a hotel of this age, however my complaints are on the overall cleanliness, a crevice tool needs to be used on the stairs, which at all times of day appeared to need vacuuming. The rooms bedspreads and curtains need replaced. My impression is the owners have made a cheap attempt to decorate, the framed paintings and pictures are very cheap replicas. Attention to detail is so important, especially if you want return guest. The breakfast while a nice offer , leaves so much to be desired we chose to eat elsewhere, even the coffee was not good. While looking forward to our overnight, I certainly would not recommend the Hotel to friends or family, and I do not think we will return, I wish I could say I would.

815,"Booked this hotel by reviews and was disappointed. This was not my first stay in SF but it was my first stay in the neighborhood. The good: beautiful lobby, safe neighborhood, decent breakfast (included), free cookies and sherry every afternoon if you're in the hotel mid-afternoon, one room has a fireplace. The bad: 1. One of the two rooms was tiny (smallest room according to the floor plan) but that didn't bother us so much. 2. The carpet in one of the rooms smelled bad (think old carpet smell in your grandma's house) - so bad that we had to leave the door open during the day. When we forgot to leave the door open one day, we came back to an awful smell again. 3. The windows was those old kind of windows without any noise insulation at all - such that at night a car driving by woke us up. Unexpected for a hotel in San Francisco in 2018. 4. Heat made a horrible sound - it almost kept us at night. 5. Our door did not close naturally, we had to actively pull it open every time we left the room. Again, this is a $200/night hotel in 2018. 6. Wifi did not work in our bed. Our room wifi only extended to the hallway and in the bathroom. 7. They charge $30 a night for parking, but neglect to tell you that there is free street parking at night time in this neighborhood. 8. Not the hotel's fault, but the neighborhood this is located in (Japantown) basically only has Asian food places and is mostly residential - not many bars/restaurants/cafes located within 10-15 min walk. We liked the quiet atmosphere but this is something to know. Overall, this place could be a great hotel but right now it's pretty shabby and needs some updating to bring it up 2018 United States standards.","July 28, 2018","14    Queen Anne Hotel

Wish every hotel I stayed at had this type of person available to travelers. The hotel does come with breakfast but don't expect more than your usual chain ones. I was expecting just a bit more considering the hotel's Victorian image.","May 5, 2018","14    Queen Anne Hotel

823,"I loved our stay here. From what I hear room 410 is the most haunted. We were placed in the room below, 310. We had some wacky moments that made it seem like this place is certainly haunted, like smelling a distinct perfume waft through the room and green/blue colored orbs following us around in our pictures... my husband and I love that stuff, so it made for an interesting stay. The victorian decor, complimentary cookies & sherry, and wild parrots flying outside the hotel all add to the unique experience. If you like bizarre and beautiful, this is the place to stay.","April 22, 2018","14    Queen Anne Hotel

824,"This is a nice, old, historic place to stay. Rooms are fairly quiet. Breakfast is ok, I thought coffee tasted fine, but cups are way too small. Staff are polite. They say the hotel is haunted. I heard noises but nothing that was a definite ghost. Could have been a noise from someone else in hotel. The morning that we left something interesting did happen. It was around 6:30am. The doors to the breakfast area were closed and lights off inside. No one else was down there except for my husband and an employee. It was cool outside so no need for heating. We had been down there for about 15 min waiting on our Uber. I was fixing my last cup of coffee when the door to the breakfast area opened by itself. Could be a normal occurrence, but it was a little spooky to me.","April 2, 2018","14    Queen Anne Hotel

825,"The lobby was wonderfully charming with decor that completes the victorian esthetic (my primary reason for choosing this hotel)! Although there were fancier rooms available, I opted for the simpler Victoria King room since the nightly rate was ideal. The Hotel offered a free ""Deluxe Continental Breakfast,"" which was pretty satisfying, along with afternoon tea during happy hour (4-6pm). Best of all, Queen Anne Hotel is nestled in a great location!!! Just a short walk away from shops and restaurants on Fillmore St. or Japantown! I would definitely book this hotel for future stays! (FYI, this hotel is apparently on a ghost tour for allegedly being haunted, however I never encountered anything out of the ordinary/supernatural in the room or hotel.

Don’t stay here if you seek the new version of SF, the modern, slick and high tech one.Queen Anne has been my home away from home when I visit San Fran for 15+ years. It’s grand and old school, romantic. I used to live in San Francisco, grew up in the Bay Area and now live in Brooklyn. Love that it’s NOT near Union Square or Fisherman’s Wharf. It’s a nice neighborhood and staying here lets you live like a local, not a tourist. The 4pm sherry and cookies are worth coming back “home” for after a day of kicking around the city. Fillmore street / lower pacific heights neighborhood is a few blocks away, as is Japantown. Lots to do within walking distance, but an easy car ride to everything else.

The location is marvelous, right in Japantown / Pacific Heights.Well, the property needs a serious upgrade. It is a very nice Victorian that with the right level of taste and care could be a spectacular hotel. As it stands, sadly, it looks dated, smells musty, and the holidays decor is in poor taste. My recommendation to the hotel: Call Bernardo Urquieta, a San Francisco architect who lives on Lake Street and has immaculate taste.Get the place redone.ASAP.It's a gigantic wastage of a fantastic property to run it with such poor taste and lack of care.And it is way too expensive the way it is at the moment.","January 1, 2018","14    Queen Anne Hotel

We knew nothing of the hotel supposedly being haunted. I half awoke one night to experience a feeling like someone was tucking me in and gently pushing on my collarbone. I thought it was a strangely comforting feeling. The next day, we found out the hotel was supposedly haunted by the former headmistress, Mary - who ran a boarding school for girls. We were told she likes to tuck people in at night! I was shocked and a little freaked out by what I’d experienced the night before. It wasn’t a scary experience, it was comforting.

834,"We visited San Francisco to see La Traviata at the opera, and came across this hotel somewhat accidentally. We were looking for a high quality hotel under $300. We ended up loving this hotel (and the staff). This hotel is like a time capsule from 1890. The first floor public rooms are filled with comfortable antiques that seem in almost new condition. The first floor has a large number of comfortable places to sit and read (including by the fire). Our room was on the 3rd floor. There's a modern elevator, but at least once you have to take the stairs to get the full 1890 effect! Our room faced Sutter street, and we didn't encounter any street noise (and I'm a fairly light sleeper). The breakfast room is large, and also appears from 1890. There were cereals, hard boiled eggs, sausage, waffles, muffins, and a number of other items. The one thing I thought would be a negative (being about 15 blocks from Union Square) turned out to be a positive- no crowds and VERY easy to get an Uber or Lyft. I never had to wait more than 3 minutes. At Union Square, you're competing with dozens of others, and how does your driver find you? We liked this hotel so much, we're going back in December.","October 5, 2017","14    Queen Anne Hotel

Asking the concierge, he explained that yes, the building is from the late 1800's. let that sink in for a minute. Now imagine the walls, the furniture pieces, the hand rails to the stairs, the wallpaper, carpets and everything else that is this Queen Anne Hotel. It turns out, that the Hotel as it is today is actually only half of what it once was. The famous fire of 1906, which was destroyed or consumed 80% of the city. Breakfast made you feel like you were Royalty. All the squeaky floors as you walked and the elevator....had the same bench from what I assume was the person who ran the elevator for their guest 100 years ago?

Our stay was pleasant enough, and the decor quaint, although the room was a bit smelly, but maybe this was the effect of Mary Lake?

Of the four, I prefer the Stanford Court because I find their standard rooms to be the largest. However, you can't go wrong at any of the four especially since they are all located where California Street crosses Powell where all three cable car lines stop. One nice feature of the Mark Hopkins and the Fairmont are their rooftop lounges with wonderful views of entire Bay area.","June 6, 2019","15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

859,"Luxury abounds in a historic hotel perched on the highest hill in San Francisco. Anything you wish for is just a phone call away and available in over 20 languages and sometimes even more. The views from the historic top of the Mark cannot be beat, from morning fog rolling in over the mountains too sunsets over the Golden Gate bridge. Nothing is too much to ask for and you are right next to two different trolley lines that you can catch right outside the hotel. The famous Tonga room tiki bar is directly next-door in the Fairmont. George, the concierge, is a wealth of knowledge. The dress code from years ago is now California casual in a tasteful and respectful form to bring joy for other international travelers. Bedding is luxurious! Windows open to catch the fresh, and chilly, ocean breeze. Lyft & Uber are always on stand by. Just six minutes from Pier 34.","June 4, 2019","15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

863,"The personal touch from each employee. I was welcomed by Hailey the front desk agent. I knew I was checking in early and she said the room was not ready yet, but had a room ready two floors below. So she got me in and new I had a long flight. The Front desk supervisor came out and welcomed me to the hotel and thanked me for being a IHG rewards member. Roy made our stay memorable! He always welcomed me with a smile and his willingness to help. He truly cared about my experience in the hotel and he made clear his pride to work at the Intercontinental. He took the extra mile to find out the nature of my stay and he made sure to ask me how things were going on a daily basis. When he found out that my wife was joining me later in the week, he couldn't wait to meet her and to make her birthday special. He is a genuine person and he made me proud to be a part of this company. Anna was outstanding as well. She greeted me on the first day by my last name and went over all the details about the club lounge. She did a great job on convincing me to order the room service since the food was so good. The club lounge team is awesome. Having the housekeeping staff say good morning every day made my day. Jaap Doelens the F&B Director came over to me in the club lounge Thursday night to see if I needed anything. The F&B team was really helpful and room service was really good. The food options was outstanding. The bellmen helped me with packages and assisting me opening them in my room. I know it is hard to find good staff, you have a great staff at this hotel. Thank you all for making my stay one of the best.","May 29, 2019","15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

864,"Weekend in San Francisco and good rate for club room relatively last minute. Old fashioned (good way) with professional and charming staff. We had an 11th floor room with good views over Grace Cathedral and distant views of both the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Location was very peaceful at weekend and nice to walk down to both Fisherman's Wharf and the Embarcadero (you will need to take a cable car/taxi/Uber back due to being on top of a very steep hill)The club lounge is a little strange as it is in the middle of the small bar/restaurant on the ground floor. The area is well policed albeit we had some interlopers enjoying the evening snacks one night. There are very few ""comfy"" chairs - most are stools/high tables, but the décor is classy and service attentive during the evening. Complimentary cocktail food was high quality and the open bar had a small selection of beers, wines and spirits available 5-7pm (it would have been nice to have more soft drinks such as cranberry or tomato juice). Breakfast was a little more chaotic with club guests mixed with the main breakfast service in the small restaurant. Once you were identified as club you were pretty much left on your own after the first coffee was poured. We found Orange Juice at the waiters stations and the buffet had a reasonable choice of breakfast items and was available until 11am if you wanted a lie-in. Fresh fruit (including home made smoothies), cookies, hot and cold beverages were available all day.We really enjoyed this piece of San Francisco history. I would rate it 4.5 stars - not overly luxurious but charming.","May 28, 2019","15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

For starters the hotel is beautiful and the staff is friendly and welcoming; we ran into the general manager Mr. Pace who gave us a great recommendation regarding good brunch spots. Our room was amazing with views of what seemed to be the whole city; as we stayed in a suite and the window in the living room was a direct view of Grace Cathedral.

Check in was a breeze, was able to head to my room in minutes and then up to the Top of the Mark for a drink and some amazing views. Before heading out for a bite we saw a couple get engaged to everyone's applause - it was a nice, fun atmosphere. After eating, we ended up back there for a night cap. The place was rocking - the band wasn't playing the type of music I'm necessarily into, but it was fun to people watch and see so many people having a good time. Headed back to my room - bed was comfy and clean - slept really well. Buffet breakfast the following morning was extensive and well stocked with something for everyone. Staff were attentive and kept the coffee coming! Check out went smoothly and my car was brought round in minutes with the minimum of fuss.

The rooms are a bit dated and the beds a little uncomfortable. The appearance of the rooms and fitting in the bathroom appear elegant but the sink and bath often good blocked. It is an old building so as expected the water piping was noisy so sleep was effected when other guest flushed the toilet etc. Overall, we are glad we stayed and accept an old building is difficult to rennovate to modern standards.

I remember thinking at the time that I doubt I would ever be able to afford to stay at such a hotel.Well, little faith I had at that time, for this past week my wife and I stayed here for 5 nights. Loved our stay.I would have to say, the service here was exceptional...whether it was the welcome you receive when checking in, or the doorman grabbing the door for you. Our room was always spotless and made up everyday. Loved the location at the top of the hill...kind of centrally located for our needs. The room had all the amenities we needed and the internet was fast and reliable. Tried breakfast and the bar downstairs...excellent. Unfortunately we never made it to the Top of the Mark...next time.The only negative I can offer is the bed...not as comfortable as I would have hoped.

We were also amazed by the architecture of the hotel itself and the decoration of the bedroom and lobby.We both were very happy with our stay, and would immediately recommend this hotel.

891,"The Intercontinental Mark Hopkins SF is a gorgeous hotel—but exteriorly only. After walking in, there are only 5 registers to check you in and 3 very small elevators to take you up. Each elevator can only hold about 6-7 people (less with luggage) and they run exceptionally slow. During evening hours, one is designated to Top of the Mark and you’re down to 2 elevators. When asked to take the stairs, we were told they don’t go to the 5th floor (that was a lie). Bottom line for the elevators, be expected to wait 5-10 minutes to ride on one. Onto the rooms...While I understand this is a historic icon, the decor is very dated and run down. The bathroom is incredibly small and narrow. There are no outlets by the night stands and only one near the desk. Overall, this hotel needs some renovations to accommodate the influx of customers. It definitely doesn’t hold up to the standard 4 star hotel. The only saving factor for this hotel is the name and location, otherwise it’s very disappointing.","January 4, 2019","15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

892,The Mark Hopkins is a San Francisco classic. As such there are some minor inconveniences that come with age. One such inconvenience is the elevator service. The three elevators are small and two service the busy Top of the Mark. During prime times be prepared to wait a long time for an elevator. I recommend the 15th floor for the best elevator service. The middle level floors are difficult for down elevator service. Otherwise the hotel is excellent in all ways. The staff is friendly and efficient. The rooms are clean and spacious. The location at the top of Nob Hill is nice but may be difficult for some to navigate. In summary the Mark Hopkins is an experience to try at least once.

893,"I stay here a couple of times a year when in San Francisco for events or visiting family and not wanting to drive the hour and a half home, or just to have fun in the City.This most recent visit Thanksgiving weekend was my best because of an upgrade to a suite with an atrium and private terrace. In the past I have upgraded myself (paid) for a room with a large outdoor terrace but it did not have an atrium. I think here is only one room in the hotel with the atrium and terrace.Because this was an upgrade (not paid for) I did not have access to the InterContinental Suite like I have had in the past when staying in a suite here, and that was fine because I have never found the Club InterContinental here to be very exciting. (Although on one stay the Club on the second floor was closed for some reason and they instead were using a hospitality suite on an upper floor - the Mark Hopkins Suite, I believe - and it was much better than the regular Club.)What's not to like about a private atrium and terrace with views of the Golden Gate Bridge all the way to the Bay Bridge? The large bathroom also had a big whirlpool tub which I enjoyed very much. And I love the REAL plants in the suites and rooms at the Mark Hopkins.Because of the wonderful suite I had most meals in and as always, the room service is excellent here. And one evening I got to speak with the room service order-taking person Carolyn who remembered me from past visits. I do feel like family at this property.The only bummer on my stay was a rather tactless bartender at the Top of the Mark one evening.My cousin joined me for the holiday Sunday brunch at the Top of the Mark and while very pricy, the food is very good and you cannot beat the view.Thank you Mark Hopkins for the wonderful upgrade and I very much look forward to my next visit.","December 18, 2018","15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

894,"We had a girlfriends’ trip to San Francisco planned and were very excited to stay at the Mark Hopkins. We were so very disappointed and would never stay there again. There were so many things that tarnished our stay. The overall property is tired. The furniture in our room was chipped and scratched, there were not enough outlets or mirrors. The beds are very small as well. The hallway was cluttered with dishes and trays outside of doors and it looked like the hallway carpets hadn’t been vacuumed in a very long time.The elevators are very slow and we took to walking the stairs to the 12th floor. Many people are coming to The Top of the Mark , but they really should have a separate elevator for them. We went up to enjoy a cocktail at The Top of the Mark, wish I could say we did. We waited to get in...no problem, but the waiting area is so small. People were jammed in elbow to elbow. When we were finally seated, we waited 45 minutes and never even got a glass of water, which we asked for twice, We realize a wait is inevitable, but 45 minutes for water is not okay. We ended up leaving because there was no point in waiting any longer. We let the hostess know why we were leaving and went elsewhere. We also let them know at checkout about the experience. We’ve been on many girls’ trips and don’t expect perfection. We do expect good customer service from a highly touted hotel. I can not recommend this hotel and would suggest splurging and staying across the street at The Fairmont.","December 17, 2018","15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

895,"This hotel was originally built in the 1920s. Hotels of this age can be pretty quirky with small rooms and tons of architectural character. But this place is fantastic. The rooms are spacious with huge windows that have fabulous views of the San Francisco skyline in the higher floors. From our room in the 9th floor we had views in three directions. The windows open bringing in lots of fresh air, yet the rooms are quiet and comfortable. The service at the hotel was fantastic. We only experienced the breakfast buffet which was excellent. They offer Asian styled breakfast, Italian style breakfast, and the normal American favorites. The service in the dining room was super friendly and warm. We were there during the Christmas season and there were choirs in the lobby and Santa was also there visiting with children in front of an enormous Christmas Tree. A very, very festive holiday spot. Great for just a visit if not a stay. Location at the top of Nob Hill was perfect. Close to Union Square and all the holiday deliciousness and festivities. Plus the price was outstanding. I have a love for Intercontinental properties as I’ve stayed at some great ones and this one does not disappoint.","December 16, 2018","15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

I'm glad to say that my 2nd experience was just as excellent as our 1st and I'm very glad that I came back. Location is excellent, but be prepared to walk uphill/downhill from every direction. I enjoy walking so that didn't bother me and you'll be a short walk to Union Square, Polk St, Chinatown, Ferry Building, North Beach, Financial District...you get the point. It's all right there and if you don't want to walk, it's incredibly easy to find Uber or taxi. Powell St Bart station is just 10 minute walk away.Check in/out was incredibly quick and easy. Service was just as friendly as my last visit and room cleanliness was great. Bed was super soft, nice amenities including a decent fitness center and wifi is reliable and fast.

916,Hotel Zoe is pretty much what you might expect from a city centre hotel It was well furnished with a nice large lobby offering water all day and coffee in the morning.The staff were generally very helpful and any requests were dealt with promptly. The reception did get overwhelmed quite often. I felt the concierge wasn’t particularly keen to find out what we wanted but more to offer things that they get a commission on. However she was helpful with general information.There was a small bar and the drinks were quite expensive but nothing out of the ordinary for San Francisco. The room was smallish but well catered and serviced every day.The outside area off the lobby was pleasant and also the fire in the main area - we warmed ourselves at it a few times after coming in from a foggy walk along Fisherman's Wharf.The location was excellent - two minutes from Fisherman’s Wharf and near the trolley bus to Union Square. We thought the Italian restaurant attached was quite ordinary foodwise and the dinner menu expensive- dinner seemed to offer less choices that lunch leaving on the more expensive options for evening dining. Staff were lovely though.They pulled the stops out getting an taxi for the airport when our SuperShuttle let us down badly - being able to summon a taxi immediately.

The concierge is very helpful and the rooms are ok. Front desk staff were very hard nosed and made absolutely no allowances for the fact that we were staying six nights, which I think is poor on their part. Every request was batted straight back from a later checkout to a quiet room. I paid up front in April and was then emailed with a special offer by the hotel of $20 a night spend in Pescatore. All I got was one $20 spend which in the small print said it was only valid for lunch and dinner-not breakfast. This is penny pinching your guests and not good customer service.

There is a fridge in the room. The staff is wonderful. We only had breakfast in the morning, but the fresh fruit was outstanding. Every fruit in the bowl was at the peak of ripeness and freshness. The coffee was probably the best drip coffee that I have ever had in a restaurant. The location of the hotel can't be beat. There is a trolley station just a couple of blocks away. You are only a couple of blocks from the heart of Fisherman's Wharf as well. There is a Safeway store right next door. Would definitely stay here again.

937,"First thing first; the front desk lady who checked us in was just plain rude from the start. And, this was even before we officially checked in. I think being a boutique hotel doesn't mean you don't train your staff. I was traveling with my wife and 1 year old kid, and was staying for 3 nights. This hotel is not a kid friendly place; we were given room on 1st floor where there are about 8-10 flight of stairs from the lobby. I requested if they can allocate a room that has elevator access such as a 2nd floor, and the message I got was this was the last room and we are fully booked. There isn't a ramp where you can take your stroller; we have to literally lift the stroller when our kid was sleeping up and down the stairs!!! They couldn't provide with very basic things that every other hotel in San Francisco provide, such as - Microwave/Kettle to heat milk, and Baby Cot. For the price we were paying, we could've as well gotten at the bigs ones such as Hyatt or Marriott as their staff will be properly trained and are kid friendly. The cleanliness of the room was subpar; we noticed hair on the bed upon checkin and when complained, was moved around to a different room on the same floor. So they did have rooms available; they just lied about it.","June 18, 2019","16    Hotel Zoe Fisherman's Wharf

954,"Stayed at this hotel for the 2nd time in one year. Got to stay in the upgraded room which is pretty neat except for the noise. The loud sounds of the elevator are so disturbing through the night that their fancy sound conditioner failed to beat! However we left very disappointed because my 2.5 year olds’ stuffed animal got lost from our room. We probably left it in our bed and during cleaning it may have been taken away accidentally by the cleaning staff. It could’ve been something more valuable and it just goes to show how careless their cleaning staff is. I tried reaching out to the front desk, lost and found and then also the manager about it but they couldn’t do anything. The issue was reported within an hour and still they couldn’t do anything about it. Hard to believe they couldn’t track their laundry and don’t know where it went. We left very disappointed because our 2.5 year old has no way to understand what happened to his baby shark and is pretty sad. I hope they are able to still find it and ship it to us as they promised and also are very very careful in the future when making the beds and cleaning the rooms to not be wrapping up people’s precious things in.","July 12, 2019","17    San Francisco Marriott Marquis

I am in a Repton said you didn’t tell her I made an honest mistake and I didn’t know that! She whispered in the phone he says he didn’t know that.

I stayed here to attend a conference at Moscone Center and it was just walking distance from the hotel. It wouldn't be wrong to describe that the hotel is located centrally being just walking distance from Union Square and other landmark places.Its a very busy hotel and yet the front office is smooth and prompt in its service. I got to stay at the 19th floor at one of the newly remodelled rooms - as the reception executive described- and i found the room spacious and accommodative. The window overlooked the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) and St Patrick Catholic church. The room came equipped with a wifi Tablet providing info about the city and the hotel. Many services of the room could be time managed with this tab - which is a good feature. The room had utilities like iron/ironing table and an electric kettle. The breakfast at the hotel was very substandard but I truly believe that it was so because the rooms were bought as a block deal by the conference managers who decided on a low cost menu to boost their own margins. The hotel shouldn't have agreed for such a third class breakfast plummeting their own standards.

The newly renovated hotel included the following deficits: inexplicable flashing light on the phone, lamp by the bed did not provide enough light to read a picture book, no adjustable desk chair, only one chair in the suite (bedroom and sitting room), no luggage rack (actually nowhere to set luggage except the floor or in the sitting room), the sofa was no more comfortable than sitting on a park bench, and no room service. The biggest problem is that the shower stall had absolutely nothing to hold onto - someone is going to fall and the hotel will be vulnerable.

The newer room was beautiful, with an incredibly comfortable bed and pillows and a fabulous bathroom with walk-in shower. Around the hotel are a variety of restaurants, and the sights of San Francisco are a short cab ride away (Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Chinatown, Presidio, Golden Gate bridge, etc.).One thing to consider, however, is this hotel and this city is EXPENSIVE. It's also difficult to see so many homeless people passed out on the street, outside of restaurants and in the parks. Lastly, regarding the conference: the space itself was fine (but in the basement, like many other hotels so no natural light) but the food that was served each day was HORRIBLE. Some of the worst conference food I have ever had. The first two days we were served the same dry kale salad (just dressed a bit differently each day), the same tasteless dry chicken breast (just prepared differently each day), with no option for something else to drink but water or coffee/hot tea with dessert. The continental breakfast was also EXACTLY the same each morning, except one day they didn't offer the boiled eggs that were served the other days.

The location of the hotel was good because it was a short trip to the BART and cable cars. I didn’t take taxi/Uber/Lyft one time. Not the hotels fault but be prepared for quite a few homeless roaming the area and asking for things. My room was spotless. I opted to not have my room cleaned in exchange for free WiFi which is absurdly expensive for WiFi. My biggest complaint was I bought a soda from The Pantry that was 6 months expired. Overall I would stay here again for the convenience it brought getting around and the cleanliness of the rooms was better than most hotels I stay at. ,"June 6, 2019","17    San Francisco Marriott Marquis

984,"My husband, son and I were first-time visitors to SF and after searching many hotels decided to go with the touristy area of Union Square. We are very pleased that we chose this hotel since it was close to many things we needed and close enough to the sights we wanted. We got an Executive King Suite which was very spacious with the much appreciated extra room for sitting and hanging out after long days of walking around and exploring the city. We got a room on the 9th floor - no view of the city - but we were fine with that. The windows were big enough to let lots of natural light in when we needed it and we didn't hear any street noise. The floor itself was super quiet and we heard nothing from other guests. The hotel was busy but big enough that it doesn't feel crowded. Check-in was a breeze. Staff is exceptional. We opted not to rent a car, using public transportation and rideshares and it was perfectly fine since the hotel is within walking distance of many places we wanted to visit or as a starting point for the tours we did. The option to rent a car was provided by a Hertz in the hotel. We also were able to book a tour to Muir Woods through the hotel and were picked up in front the hotel. All very convenient. We had a lovely time in the City by the Bay and would definitely stay at the Marriott Marquis again. ","June 5, 2019","17    San Francisco Marriott Marquis

The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.The View lounge on 39th Floor is well worth a visit for an evening drink to enjoy the atmosphere and city lights. It was very busy when we visited at the weekend.The hotel is walking distance to lots of the city - we even walked to the Pier for Alcatraz - around 30 minutes.

The new cotton/fiber duvets are just not as comfortable as the old feather ones.After checking out we still had more of the city to explore before we started our drive down to Los Angeles. The hotel was able to provide complementary luggage storage for us while we explored the city which was very helpful.

However, a recent change to the rewards program now denies access to the Clum M lounge to Gold members (it is for Platinum only). The benefit and value of this for breakfast, and an occasional snack previously made the premium price of this hotel worth it. I was disappointed to be denied access to the Club M, and even asked a manager for an exception. I was told it was too busy that week, yet in passing by I often saw lots of empty tables. Now it seems that the only benefits that saves any money that is available to members below Platinum level is free internet, which any level member gets. I loved my corner room with a view, but will have to evaluate my total budget for my next trip. Colleagues stayed at AirBNBs and a diff hotel nearby, and saved considerable money.

1013,"My mom and I stayed here for two nights in the suite on the first floor (room 1). Overall the experience was great, but I don't think it was worth what we paid for the room. The room was clean, and the beds were super comfortable, but overall it felt just a little bit run-down. The breakfast was great, they have bread from a local bakery and a good selection of other continental breakfast items. It was very quiet, I was worried about being so close to the front door but I didn't have any issues sleeping. The staff was friendly and helpful. A great option in an area of the city without a ton of hotels to choose from.","October 2, 2018","18    The Grove Inn

1014,"This little Inn is part hotel, part B & B. The hotel has the charm of an authentic large residence, rather than a sterile hotel. Each room has its own bathroom and is well-appointed and quaint. The bathroom is modern and very clean. The mattress is very comfortable and the sheets are ironed. The rooms are quiet. The Inn is located in a very quiet and safe residential neighborhood. It is only blocks from Alamo Square and Painted Ladies and less than a mile from the famous Haight Ashbury neighborhood. There are not a lot of restaurants in the vicinity. We used inexpensive Uber rides to get to various districts with no waiting time. We also walked to a nearby stop to catch the Big Bus Tours. The Inn is an excellent value. For under $225, we were able to drop off our luggage first thing in the morning until we landed back to the Inn in the evening. The next morning, the staff provided a buffet-style Continental Breakfast in two sunny adjoining front rooms. The following day, we were able to leave our luggage for the entire day, prior to departing the city. We saved a lot of money, even factoring in Uber rides. Mark, the manager, was professional and welcoming. You will be happy if you choose this delightful experience! ","July 28, 2018","18    The Grove Inn

1015,"Sometimes you book hotels based on the Internet pictures and are disappointed. This beautiful old Victorian inn did not disappoint. It was small and had no elevator, but this added to the quaintness and authenticity of an old inn. It was clean, the breakfast was very fresh and good (European style), the bed was great and we had a nice sized room with a queen bed, a private bath, and a bay window. We wanted to be close to UCSF Hospital as my daughter had a surgery planned there, and we were 2 miles away. The bus stopped right at the corner so we could catch it there. Also, there were so many beautiful homes to see in the neighborhood. We walked and rode the buses everywhere. THe staff gave us good advice, such as use the local bus service and streetcars ($2.75 per ticket which is good for 90 minutes and $1.35 for seniors!) We were in walking distance of the Painted Ladies, Alamo Park, and Japan Town food. There was also a McDonald's close by. We enjoyed our stay here.","July 10, 2018","18    The Grove Inn

1016,"We were in San Francisco for a couple of days for an event at Civic Center Plaza and wanted to find a place within walking distance. I'm so glad we came across The Grove Inn! On our check-in day, we arrived early. The room wasn't available yet, but we were able to store our bags and one of the Inn attendants gave us restaurant and coffee shop recommendations.We stayed in one of the upstairs rooms facing the street and it was very comfortable! The place has a unique ""old house"" feel to it, which was very cool. For breakfast, there was coffee, tea, orange juice, fresh bread from a local bakery, as well as other assorted breakfast items (cereal, oatmeal, etc.). Between the friendliness of the staff, the charm of the building, and the convenience of the location (walking distance to Alamo Square, many restaurants, and Civic Center Plaza), this is undoubtedly a place to which I'll be returning.","June 6, 2018","18    The Grove Inn

1020,"The Grove Inn occupies a lovely Italianate-Victorian style building with plenty of curb appeal, its crisply clean exterior decorated with charming historic accents. Situated in a low-key, peaceful neighborhood, it is within easy walking distance of Alamo Square Park, the Painted Ladies, Golden Gate Park, Haight-Ashbury, Japantown, and many other attractions. Nearby you’ll find grocery stores, bars, and restaurants, including a good seafood place right across the street. It has ready access to public transportation, or, of course, Uber. We arrived in the afternoon and were smoothly checked-in by Mark, the warm and friendly manager. The stairs were somewhat daunting, but we knew this place had stairs before booking. Immaculate and comfortable, the room had two big windows providing pleasing daylight, a desk (the television was on it), two nightstands, and an excellent bed. We stayed in a corner room overlooking a side street. Yes, there was traffic and trolley noise, but it didn’t bother us. The sink is in the sleeping area, not the bathroom. This also didn’t bother us. For one night, or even two, this place was perfect for us. The rate we paid was more than a bargain, and you’d be hard-pressed to find better value in the immediate vicinity. The breakfast was a simple, mostly “dry” self-serve buffet, which was fine.But, if you’re like me, the little things that you can overlook for one night grow into annoyances the longer you stay. We stayed three nights, and several things wore on me. There is no thermostat in the room, and no way to control the temperature other than asking someone at reception, which is not helpful late at night. The oddly configured bathroom has no towel rack immediately accessible from the shower. The shower stall was too small (I’m 5’ 5” and 130 pounds), and the shower curtain plastered itself to me each time I stepped too close to it to avoid the suddenly changing temperature from the touchy shower control - yuck. The room has no clock, no fridge, and no microwave. The hotel has a shared fridge guests can use downstairs in the breakfast area, which is locked at night. We knew about the fridge when we booked, but we did end up missing having one in the room. The customer service changed somewhat on the weekend, when two different young women replaced Mark, and neither was overly friendly.A note to first-time San Francisco visitors (we have family here): I described the neighborhood as peaceful, but you should be careful to maintain situational awareness at all times when you are out walking, especially around the parks, and particularly at night. A little caution will help you enjoy a safe, problem-free visit.Overall, the Grove Inn is a clean, pretty, professionally run and comfortable establishment in a perfect location, providing great value and a reliable home base for your San Francisco stay.","January 18, 2018","18    The Grove Inn

1021,"The very friendly staff checked in with me prior to arrival to see when I might be arriving, invited me to joint he continental breakfast even if my room was not yet ready that morning, allowed me to store my backpack in the lobby area until I could properly check in and also the next day when I had to leave early and keep my belongings there all day. The room was comfortable - the very high ceilings give it a spacious feel that is rare in an urban hotel, even in a bed and breakfast. The TV was mounted very high into a corner, but I didn't mind too much. The tall ceiling made the shower stall and bathroom feel especially large which was really nice, along with the option to use the handheld showerhead or the fixed showerhead. Cute small set-up in the room for coffee, tea, and water. Wish my schedule allowed me to partake int he continental breakfast, but all I needed was a good landing spot, and the Grove Inn suited my needs nicely. The location is an easy walk to Alamo Square, the Castro, or the Haight, and also near many public transportation bus/train lines to get anywhere else in the city. It is centrally located so rideshares are also inexpensive to other destinations.","October 9, 2017","18    The Grove Inn

1022,"Well, perhaps just secret from me. I lived in the city for a long time and hence didn't know too much about the hotel situation here, but in our search for lodging for a weekend trip, we found the city to be very expensive! The Grove Inn, however, had a great price (best price I found, incidentally was booking directly with them) and good reviews. So I was a little worried before arriving, but as it turns out, I shouldn't have been.It's somewhere between a traditional B&B and a hotel. It honestly felt a bit like we had an apartment and were living in SF instead of just vacationing for the weekend. Something about the facade of the building, and the fact that it's on a very residential street.Our room was small, but nice and clean. Staff is very friendly. Some reviews mentioned having trouble with the lobby door, so we were a bit worried about that. But this must have been an old issue. It's now a key fob system and it gave us absolutely no trouble.There was one hiccup with breakfast, but the staff proactively made it right without us having to say anything, so they honestly scored points with this.This will be my go to SF hotel from now on.","September 25, 2017","18    The Grove Inn

1023,"We just stayed one night at The Grove Inn. It's quite a nice place. We travel to England frequently, and it reminded me of the B&B's we stay in there. The room was fully outfitted with a coffee maker, a jug of water, etc. We were on the second floor so were able to sleep with the windows open - that along with a tower fan made the room very comfortable. Our room was right by the busy, noisy street, but it didn't bother us. They do offer earplugs. The room is clean and they had quite a nice continental breakfast. We slept well though the mattress was not very comfortable. The only downside for us was the parking. It is only 5 blocks away so I guess that's not so bad. This is a nice place with very friendly staff.","September 20, 2017","18    The Grove Inn

1024,"The room is as shown on their website. Room itself was clean and tidy. Bed was comfortable. Check in was easy. Location is quite central that it is about $10 Uber ride to most places in the city. One girl at the front desk was not very friendly, but the other was really nice. Most people follow the rules, so it was fine. A lot of good coffee shops within walking distance. The problem is the bathroom. I understand San Francisco is not a cheap place to stay, but I would expect my room to come with a more proper bathroom. I booked a ""Deluxe Queen with Bay Window"". It is supposed to be the second most expensive room on the estate (the most expensive is the suite). When I opened the door of the bathroom, I was surprised. It is dated and only got a tiny shower. The sink is outside of the bathroom near the entrance of the room. The slide door does not lock properly because the property is older so the door was slightly out of alignment. Lucky that I was staying with my husband so we could still sort it out. Toilet button is broke although it still flashes properly. The toilet seat rocks it bit too (I am only 110lbs). Grouting in the shower is moldy and I found 2 hair inside of it too. I remembered the bathroom on the website was much nicer and I found they put ""your booked room may differ slightly from rooms displayed in photos"". Great, but I would not say that is ""slightly"". The room is 4 stars for a small inn, but the bathroom over deserve 2 stars even being generous. Therefore I will only give it 3 stars.","July 27, 2017","18    The Grove Inn

1025,"Nice little B&B where it’s located in residential neighborhood, close to bus stops, and if you drove, the parking garage that they recommended has a very good value ($20/day). Very close (walking distance) to famous Painted Ladies – famous Victorian and Edwardian houses – and Alamo Square Park. About 2-3 miles to City Center (Union Square) or Fisherman’s Wharf. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, but the bathroom was a bit too small. No elevator if you got a room on second floor and/or has a big suitcase because this B&B is a typical SF Victorian style house with only staircase. Breakfast was good and quite standard with cereals, variety of breads and pastries, hard boiled eggs, and fresh fruits (oranges and bananas) and coffees and teas.

1040,"We began our search for interesting accommodation about 2 months ago and noted that the The Grove Inn was already starting to fill. After comparing options with hotels ($$$$), Air B&B (little selection) and other Inns/B&Bs (smaller with limited availability), we found ourselves returning online to look again at this location. We took the plunge, booked two rooms and have just finished seven nights there. We are glad we did.The Grove Inn is located just one block away from the Painted Ladies, which you, after walking around the neighbourhood, will realize are just another bunch of attractive Victorian homes. The Inn itself is a moderately well-appointed establishment that has a history of accommodating people back to the mid-1800s. There are about a dozen rooms in various configurations and our two rooms were the Queen with bay window and the deluxe double room. The room is well-sized, but not huge. Bedding is crisp and white and beds are moderately firm with a pillow top. The only discussion point might be the compact bathroom, but the shower pressure is good and the toilets flush quietly. Unlike many other B&Bs there is no common area with comfy sofas, but face it: one is not in San Francisco to hang about the hotel. There is no onsite parking, but other reviewers have suggested options nearby.The inn staff members are attentive and helpful and work from the office for about 12 hours per day, locking up at night. Late night arrivals can be accommodated, though, because the staff can buzz you in remotely and you will find your keys in an envelope just inside the front door. Breakfast is continental, with a couple of cereals, fresh fruit, boiled eggs, OJ, and some excellent baked goods from The Mill bakery on nearby Divisadero street. If you have to check out early to catch a flight, the staff will leave a tray of food in your room the night before. Finally, several great dinner options exist within walking distance (about 4 blocks away) in Hayes Valley and there are a couple more good eating establishments on Divisadero. In short, the Grove Inn is a really great place to stay if you are not wedded to the idea of being in a big hotel downtown.","November 19, 2016","18    The Grove Inn

1045,"This is a very sweet, but still clean and modern inn. There is a continental breakfast that is more European than American, reminds me of a lot of breakfasts I had in hostels and hotels in Europe. The breakfast isn't super impressive, but will be enough to fill you up for a day of sight seeing. When we arrived, someone showed us our room but mentioned that there was a suite available if we would rather have that. We were traveling with an infant, so we were thrilled to have the suite with an extra room so that we could still have a light/the tv on after the baby went to sleep. The only negative was that the inn did not have any cribs, which was somewhat surprising. However, luckily I had called ahead to ask about the crib so we were prepared, and rented a pack-n-play from a baby rental service. But that is the only negative I would say about the inn, so if you don't need a crib, then I would highly recommend. I loved the area it was in, and actually booked the inn after asking a friend who recently lived in San Francisco where to stay. This was not a touristy area at all, but felt more like when you stay in an air bnb and are really in a neighborhood where locals hang out and live. Painted ladies is around the corner, Patricia's green area is nearby and has a beer garden and other great bars and shops, the Inn is on the corner of Fillmore street and if you go a bit north on that there is a great shopping and dining.","October 24, 2016","18    The Grove Inn

1048,"We stayed here when San Francisco was having a heat wave. There was no AC. Room temp were almost 90 degrees. For a northerner, this is tough. Opening the windows let fresh air in and the noise. It is right next to a bus line. There was no parking and the nearest garage is 4 blocks away. Walking back to the hotel late at night might bother some people. The rooms were comfortable, the bed was okay. The breakfast spread was good. The coffee excellent.

1050,"In all this place was acceptable. We chose it because it was slightly away from the touristy areas. We didn't find it to be spectacular. The room was fine but the breakfast leaves much to the imagination. Whilst a gluten free option is given, it really its just a bagel so don't get too excited! We didn't find the staff to be particularly friendly, but they weren't rude. Just seemed to not want to be there. We were pretty disappointed to have been told to park 5 blocks away in a parking lot for $20 per night when we arrived late on a Friday night and the weekend free street parking! In all it isn't awful, but from the great reviews and cost of the B and B we expected a little more. ","September 16, 2016","18    The Grove Inn

Last time in SF we stayed at an overpriced Hyatt - NEVER AGAIN (+$550 a night, no extras, $50 a night parking, surrounded by homeless/drug users.) The Grove Inn cost less than half of that per night, for a cute, quirky, historic stay in a former Gold Rush rooming house. Our room had a pretty bay window, and high ceilings. Extras included a nice breakfast, and coffee maker in the room, coffee all day, fruit and internet. The rooms are small and crowded, a sink was in the room, the bathroom was minuscule, and there is a steep Victorian staircase up to the room. None of this bothered us, as the price was right, we simply embraced the unique aspects of this quaint, inexpensive, friendly little B & B.","July 26, 2016","18    The Grove Inn

Breakfast was a pleasure staff very welcoming and friendly. Omelettes made to order and a self service pancake maker. Room was small/compact but had everything we needed and was cleaned daily. We were on the second floor and had no view except of heating/water systems but also had no noise either. Beds were very comfy and travel size shampoos and shower gels were supplied. Our room had a safe mini fridge and tv with cable channels. Although there is no gym in hotel you do get full access to a local facility (2 min walk). I would definitely recommend this hotel for both staff, facilities and location. You can get cable car directly outside and the local Starbucks opens at 4:30am .....

The bed was comfy and room was the perfect size for two. We very much appreciated the fridge, operable windows, and ceiling fan. One of my favorite things, though, was that since this is an old building that hasn’t been messed with, is that it was one of the quietest hotels I’ve stayed at in recent memory. Plus, if you’re child free like me, I think the fact that most rooms have just one bed keeps things extra quiet.Other things I loved?

We had to keep window open often, as it did get too hot at times, especially after someone showers, but the fan they provided was helpful. I learned this hotel was haunted after I booked, but we never encountered any paranormal activity during our stay.","April 30, 2019","19    Chancellor Hotel on Union Square

1088,"This is an older hotel, that is in need of some work. We stayed in a suite on the top floor. The room was large enough, although we would have preferred a king sized bed. The suite had two bathrooms, with different showers (shower in bath combos). One was better than the other. The furniture, carpets and fittings are all in need of an update as they have aged. The front desk and bell service was good, and the buffet breakfast, while small, was fine.Happy hour at the small hotel bar was also a nice spot in the afternoon with the sports on and full bar available. Bar staff were fantastic. The location can't be faulted, right next to union square and on the cable car stop which can be taken down to Fisherman's wharf.Although it does have it's ""quirks"", I wouldn't have a problem with staying here again as it was good value for money compared to other hotels in the area.I do need to know however - why a bottle opener was installed next to the toilet roll holder in the bathroom ?

1090,"This is a great little boutique hotel. The staff was very friendly. It is in a very good location in Union Square, close to restaurants and shopping. There is also a Walgreens and Starbucks right on the corner of the street that the hotel is on. When people say that the rooms are tiny, they mean that the rooms are tiny! But they are comfortable. The beds are nice. The toilet is about one inch away from the wall, but otherwise the small bathroom is nicely done. Water pressure and temperature were both great in the shower. It’s a very deep tub, so be aware if you have mobility issues that you do have to lift your legs quite high to get in and out. Remember this is an old building! The corridors and elevators are very narrow! A fuse got blown in our room and I called guest services and they came immediately and fixed it. I couldn’t believe how fast they arrived. WiFi and TV service were not the best. Overall, no complaints, I would stay here again and would recommend it. ","April 24, 2019","19    Chancellor Hotel on Union Square

Very close to Union Square though if that's your need. Free coffee and cookies most of the time in the lobby. Rooms are tiny, compared to most other rooms in chain hotels. The bathroom reminded me of an aircraft toilet, but with enough room to swing your elbows. Everything was clean and smelled good though. This area of SF is engaging enough that you don't spend much time in a hotel room.

I tried to order a bottle of water to take to my room, but they didn’t sell water and directed me to the local store! First time that happened to me, they really should stock water. They had a water dispenser near the receptionist but not everyone likes cucumber flavoured water.

1102,"We spent one night in SF to see a show and the Chancellor’s location at Union Square was perfect! It’s within walking distance to most big theatres like the Golden Gate and the Curran, plus it’s next to many terrific restaurants like Roxanne’s Café, Maru Sushi, and next door to the landmark Sears Fine Food.The Chancellor’s lobby is warm and inviting like a little jewel box. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. We did offsite parking one block away for just $20, the cheapest rate you’ll find in SF! Our room, 1402, was clean, fresh and very stylish. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens were top-quality. The towels were plush and the soap/shampoo were high quality. The hotel doesn’t pretend to be something it’s not (like a boring cookie-cutter chain) but rather it celebrates being an old-school, elegant SF property. Just two cons: there isn’t any air-conditioning, which didn’t pose a problem in March, but may be an issue in August or September. However, there is a modern, well-run ceiling fan, an extra fan in the closet, and widows that open all the way. The second con: no coffee in the rooms. To their credit, I was fully aware of both cons before I booked the hotel. We didn’t eat their offered breakfast ($18), but went next door to Sears Fine Food (we’d been wanting to try it). Otherwise we would have tried it. The variety looked delicious. The value for your money was well worth it. Yes, it was March (likely a shoulder month) but at $159 plus taxes it couldn’t be beat. I’m torn between telling everyone or keeping this place to myself, but I think the secret is out! ","March 3, 2019","19    Chancellor Hotel on Union Square

So often now staying at hotels you feel like you just have a sheet on the bed here.

1108,"I recently stayed at this hotel with my husband while we were in town for a conference. It was more affordable than the conference hotel and conveniently located in Union Square - a vibrant, walkable area with plenty of restaurants, entertainment and large retail stores. It's a quaint hotel, but we enjoyed the complimentary coffee and free cookies in the lobby! We didn't have much of a view; our room was facing a couple of buildings. However, it was not something that was super important to us on this particular occasion.There are a few things in this hotel that we did not take advantage of because we were on the go, such as the buffet breakfast for $18 a person and the bar (they had a 2 for 1 drink special). However, we appreciated at least having those options available to us! My only complaint about the hotel is that once daily, someone from the staff knocked on our door at a random time - once about a radiator out in the hallway (that was not ours), once about replacing a shower curtain (which we did not request), and once about something that we didn't bother to find out about because we did not want to be disturbed and therefore didn't answer the door. There was no 'Do Not Disturb' sign to put on the door and I'm sure the hotel staff were well meaning, but during the few moments of downtime that we had in the room outside of sleeping at night, it would have been nice to not have anyone knocking for random things.Overall, this is a nice hotel that provides many amenities and is in a great location. My only recommendation is to have 'Do Not Disturb' signs for all of the rooms. It's possible that the one for our room was simply missing, but I'm noting this anyway - just in case!","January 26, 2019","19    Chancellor Hotel on Union Square

On checking in the receptionist was rather abrupt and we were given a room upstairs which was very musty and had mould on the walls. We requested to move rooms, and were given a room on the ground floor. This room still smelt but there were no obvious signs of mould. The rooms were fairly comfortable, but they were not as clean/ modern as they look on the photos. The walls and ceilings are very thin, so we were woken very early each morning when the room above us woke up. We had a car with us, and the free hotel parking was very useful. We were lucky to always manage to have a space during our stay (there are not enough spaces for all rooms).The location was fine, and we could get everywhere we wanted to via bus/ taxi, and there were a few nice restaurants within walking distance.

The room, bathroom and linen was clean and the beds very comfortable. Luckily we were on the ground floor as there is no lift so bear this in mind if travelling with a lot of luggage! The room could do with a bit of a facelift in terms of the carpet and paint however it was comfortable. The continental style breakfast was a nice touch and enough to get us started for the day. Very good daily housekeeping. The Inn is in an excellent location. The Bay Area/Gharardelli square is about a 20 minute walk and Fisherman’s Wharf another 10 minutes. There are excellent views on the way if you walk over the park area opposite Safeway. The Hop On bus goes from just up the road (5 minute walk) and is easily accessible for the trolley buses and cable cars. There is an excellent Safeway supermarket about 10 minute walk away and there are a couple of convenience stores around the corner. The main downside for us was that there is no safety deposit box in the room so we had to carry our cash and passports everywhere. We were offered the choice to leave these at reception but would have preferred a safe in the room. It did not have the luxuries of some hotels but if you are looking for a place to lay your head after a busy day it is a clean and comfortable choice in a safe and easily accessible location.","May 3, 2019","20    Seaside Inn

I can’t see what that has to do with a hotelier!

1124,"Good location on Lombard street within walking distance to the port where you can get the tours to Alcatraz and visit nearby fisherman’s Wharf. We rented a car at the airport and dropped it off at beach street as we were getting on a cruise and this worked out cheaper than taxis. There was free parking at the hotel and once we parked we didn’t use the car until the last morning when we went to visit the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a short drive away.I did observe that all the while we were there (Thursday -Saturday)that there was enough parking for all the guests. Lombard Street is busy so there may be some traffic noise but it wasn’t too bad. We certainly slept well in the comfortable huge bed. The rooms are fine with a nice shower. A light breakfast is available free of charge in the reception area. We arrived around 2 pm and were allowed to check in. We then walked to fisherman’s wharf and spent the rest of the day there and nearby which was very nice, with plenty of dining options ,before walking back (around 30 minutes). On day two we walked to Alcatraz landing,where you get the Alcatraz tour,again around 30 minutes, I highly recommend taking this tour but make sure you book in advance. After Alcatraz we walked to the nearby (10-15 minutes), cable car terminus and took the car to Union square ($7). This was very good and once we arrived we had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Macy’s which was on the top floor so a nice lunch with good views. Afterwards we walked to Coit Tower (warning: there was a a few tough hills to negotiate with the one near the tower being particularly hard). This walk also took you through China town and took 30-45 minutes but took us longer as we looked around etc oh and of course we had to rest a few times! Once at the tower ($8 entry) we took the elevator to the top and enjoyed some lovely views of San Francisco. After this we walked to Lombard Street and up the crooked street(it’s steep!). This took about 30-45 minutes. Luckily our hotel was on Lombard street about 20 minutes on (walking) from the the cooked street. A shower and a glass of wine concluded our day. The next morning we drove to the Golden Gate Bridge and parked up ‘this side’ of it. I think it’s around $4 per hour to park although we got there around 6.15 am (jet lag?) so it’s free until 8 am. This was plenty of time to walk across and back. This was a great experience with lovely views. I hope our review of the hotel and what we did is helpful and please feel free to ask any questions.

1125,"Overall this worked well for us. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds which was cosy but manageable. Rooms are clean.Breakfast is laid out in reception and is a collection only to take back to the room, but it was ok. Coffee/juice/tea, bananas, apples, packaged pastries, croissants and muffins. The staff are all really great - very friendly. This has the feel of a family run business with everyone bought into giving guests a good experience.Parking is limited but adequate for the number of rooms. It is however free which compared to other hotels, saved $25-30 per night on other options we researched.Be aware that it’s not located close to Fisherman’s Wharf or Union square - it was a 30 minute walk to FW ... and an estimated 50 mins Union Square (but we just got an Uber). Also despite being on Lombard street, this isn’t the crooked zig zag part of the street which also isn’t close. The major improvement would better WiFi. Forget about streaming. It’s good enough for emails (without attachments) but even social media catchups weren’t good. Overall this worked well for us and we were happy with our choice. ","April 21, 2019","20    Seaside Inn

1131,"OK: this is a motel on a main road. The rooms are accessed via the car park, so they are very noisy, as the doors are not insulated, and are on the access route to the other rooms so you have to keep the blinds closed all the time unless you want everyone going past looking in. In fact, you cannot open the windows so there is no way of getting fresh air into the room without leaving the door open. The room really needs redecorating and refurbishing in parts. the furniture looks as if it dates from the 70s, and is really showing its age. Clean, but with quite an unpleasant smell of strong products to mask underlying dirt. The TV remote was particularly grubby. The room only has disposable (recyclable?) cups, which is a shame; even cheap B&Bs give you real mugs and glasses. Also, sound insulation is poor; you can't avoid hearing people next door. Plus side: the hosts and staff are friendly and helpful, free wifi (with needs refreshing daily), individual heating/cooling, continental-type breakfast which you pick up from reception (it would have been good to have some jam/honey and yogurt), good bathroom (which needs regrouting), iron, fridge, microwave & coffee maker in the room.

1133,"After thoroughly researching prices for our chosen week, we booked directly with this hotel. We had apparently picked a very expensive week in San Francisco, so we chose not to pay ridiculous prices for a 4-star hotel. The manager of the hotel was extremely accommodating,as were all of the employees we encountered. She gave us an excellent rate for our first night since we had to arrive after 1 a.m. and we thought that was very fair. We much appreciated that.The furnishings are a little tired and could use some updating, but the staff keeps them extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. We did hear traffic noise. If that bothers you, you might not want to pick this hotel. This didn't bother us at all, since we put in two very hard days of San Francisco sightseeing and were exhausted when we got back. The area is not scary at all. We utilized the bus system for most of our time in the city, and it was a safe walk to get to the stops that we needed..

1169,We spent 3 nights here whilst in San Francisco. It's located a few minutes walk from the bay and bridge views. There are a couple of bicycle hire places nearby. It's a cheap taxi or uber to Pier 39 or Union Square. There is a shopping/dining strip about 5-10 minutes walk away. The room was spacious enough with a comfortable bed. You could hear a little bit of noise from the room next door especially if they stomped around. It was good value for San Francisco.,"October 10, 2017","20    Seaside Inn

1170,"From the outside, not so great. Looks like a 50's motel. All outside entrances. No elevator. We were on the second floor of two. Not really a big deal for us though. The rooms, however are very nice and super clean. Bed was really comfortable!!!. Bathroom spotless with nice shower. The rooms have obviously been redone. was a little noisy but not bad at all. The management was really nice and let us leave our luggage in the office until check-in. 15 to 20 minute walk to pier 39.. great walk down by the water to the pier, etc about 2-3 blocks away. Beautiful view of the golden gate bridge as you walk. Light breakfast in the morning in the office. Croissants, muffins, sweet rolls, bananas, apples with juice and coffee. Certainly enough for us. Oh yes, the rooms have a microwave and mini fridge. Dish tv with large flat screen. Nothing is cheap in San Francisco!!!!! All in all we were very pleased with this motel and would for sure stay here again. If you are looking for luxury, this is not your place, but a nice, clean and comfortable room... you will get it.

1190,"We recently stayed at The Seaside during a 5 night stay in San Fran. This hotel is close to everything, you have plenty of choices with Lombard Street but we chose Seaside for it modern look and its reviews. We were not disappointed. Yogi at the front desk was extremely helpful and cheerful. I have since read some mixed reviews about this place and I have to say, the service is of a high standard. Although Lombard Street is busy, you are a short walk from the beautiful Filmore and Union shopping districts as well as a short walk to the Marina district. We spend a bit of time in both places. Fisherman's wharf is a longer walk but absolutely doable, or you can take an Uber which will only cost you $10 or so. We walked everywhere, a few Ubers out at night and a bike ride from the hotel thanks to the hire store next door. The rooms are spacious and clean, with modern fit outs. We slept four friends in there comfortably. A little more space for luggage would have been helpful but not an issue. Wifi was excellent and although I've seen some poor reviews in terms of breakfast, it was actually a bonus that it was provided. We just grabbed a piece of fruit and headed out, if people want a sit down breakfast then perhaps they should book more than a 3 star motor inn. Our only issue was on our last night when the couple next door decided to make a LOT of noise at midnight until about 3am. The walls are perhaps not as thick as first thought! We soon called Yogi and the noise ceased. No noise was heard from the street from our room, which was at the back of the building.I would stay at Seaside Inn again when travelling to San Fran","February 2, 2017","20    Seaside Inn

Which means that you are checking the various motels on Lombard street.I can tell you that choosing this place is an ok choice. The location is fine: you can rent bikes on the street (the rental location 3 blocks west is 10 usd cheaper per day); and there are public busses on Chestnut which bring you to Fisherman’s Wharf. The expensive tourist hop-on-hop-off bus stops 2 blocks away.From the inside the rooms have been nicely updated; to a decent hotel level. It’s not very spacious; but nothing is in SF. The wifi works, the fridge works and there is a microwave in the room.Tips: if you come by car; you can park for free. But there are more rooms than parking spots.And if you have 1 of the 2 rooms with a window on streetside: eventhough you have double-glass in the window, it is very very noisy. And don’t count too much on breakfast: there is coffee and juice to drink or you can chew on some banana’s, croissants or prepacked rolls.

1207,"This hotel was a great start to the beginning of our USA trip. We were greeted warmly by happy staff. Check-in and out was very quick and efficient. Staff were able to answer all questions we asked and we were given all the information we needed about the hotel, places of interest and the surrounding area. The complimentary nightly social wine and live music is a great way to meet and greet other hotel guests from all over the world and share stories of your travels, just a wonderful idea. We loved the quaint and unique décor which makes you feel right at home. The rooms are just like pictured on line, very quaint, clean, and the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is modern and very clean. Be mindful of: 1) There is no fridge in the room - although not that big of an issue really; and 2) Inconsiderate guests that travel in groups and they have rooms on the same floor, leave their doors to their rooms open and have conversations from room to room, from outside their rooms into the hallways, speaking very loud and at times laughing till late into the night, not realising that there are other guests staying there that can hear all their conversations as well, although this isn't the hotel's fault, guests should be more considerate and respectful to other guests.We would definitely stay here again if we ever return to San Fran. The hotel is in an excellent location. Loved it here.","July 3, 2019","21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

1208,Old dated hotel room that appears new on the picture. The hallway smells and the rooms smell. Our closet smelled like smoke so we told the staff. They came to spray it but failed to open the windows to air out. Had to sleep next night in the room with the nasty chemical spray. Didn’t offer to move us or anything. The only thing that’s good about this place is the location and water filters on each floor. For the money you are paying to stay there definitely not worth it. Parking overnight is $30. ,"July 1, 2019","21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

1209,"This place served its purpose just fine but wasn’t anything special. The room was very small but clean, however it was very loud making it tough to sleep. When we checked in the person doing it didn’t tell us anything, so we didn’t know there was any ice, and that there were refrigerators available upon request etc. I wouldn’t stay here again just because I don’t think it’s a good value, but there wasn’t anything overtly wrong with it, just personal preference.

Whilst the foyer and reception was informal, the staff on duty were welcoming and informative, although a little pushy trying to book you on to trips, etc. The room, 414, was at the back of the hotel, not much of a view, but quiet. Well equipped, save for a fridge which was shipped in before we got to the room by the housekeeping staff. Very clean with everything we needed. Nightly complimentary wine in the foyer during a happy hour. Food in the restaurant was good in the evenings, less so at breakfast. We were advised by the reception staff to “always turn right when leaving the hotel”. Why?

The restaurant was within the hotel but not part of it, it is expensive and you have to complete a form if you want it added to your room. Whilst the location isn’t bad, it is quite a walk to all the key attractions, if you have any mobility problems this is not a good location to stay and there were no accommodations made to help anyone with a disability.","June 12, 2019","21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

1223,"Hotel has great character but was lacking in a few areas that I would think would be easily corrected. The Wi-Fi is atrocious; don't rely on it if you need it for work or something else important. They charge you 15 bucks a day for the privilege of using the barely functional Wi-Fi...along with some filtered water and a daily paper.The room was cramped, but a different layout could improve that and add space for more countertop/shelving to place luggage and items. Most of our belongings stayed on the floor. The rooms include a Keurig coffee maker with fantastic coffee pods, but they're chintzy on supplying sugar packets, which seems weird given the rest of the great coffee setup. Our biggest beef was that there is no fridge in the room. Even cheap Motel 6's have a mini-fridge in the room! There is a large closet with a safe and an ironing board and iron, which would be easily big enough for a mini-fridge (or more shelving/countertop space).Complaints aside, the hotel is tastefully decorated, has great character and the staff are all first-rate and very helpful. It was a pleasure to speak with any of them, but Theo in particular was a fantastic ambassador of the hotel and the city overall. As long as a visitor is aware of the shortcomings, I would recommend the hotel.","May 21, 2019","21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

1228,"It's not the fanciest, newest or most deluxe hotel by a long shot, but the Hotel Carlton (a 1920s charmer) is a great value in a screamingly expensive city and with all due respect to SarahFromChicago, it is well located with plenty of nearby sights and conveniences.Where do I start? The staff. What a nice group of people. When we arrive a computer glitch was preventing keys from being programmed so Gianni (Johnny?) swept us and our luggage upstairs and made us comfortable. The desk staff are a delightful bunch who remember you and wave hello and goodbye and do what they can to show they care. Leo (again name?) has actually organized musical events with free wine at cocktail hour--and those bands and singers, musically diverse combos, were a real pleasure and not just a noisy feature.Room 317 had no view at all but that simply didn't matter. It was quiet and comfortable and the cleaning staff were efficient. Unlike several places we have stayed recently, there was no arriving back at 4:00 and finding the room had not yet been tidied. The rooms are modest in size but again--unless you have several people spending a lot of time in the room, just how much space is necessary? The television was decent sized and good quality. The bathroom was efficient and well lit. There was ample space in the closet and several large drawers in the bureau. On every floor is a watercooler and a pitcher in the room makes that a truly nice feature. Oh, and the glasses are actually glass and the coffee cups are ceramic. I can't tell you how pleasant that is. Ice is on the main level as is a microwave should you need one. We used ice daily and the microwave twice. We had not originally planned to have a car, but we ended up borrowing the grandson's car so we could get back and forth--and because the garage on the immediate next corner, really only a hundred feet away has a $25 hotel rate. The staff there are delightful and in the end, this great value saved us a ton on Ubers.Need a Walgreens? It is two blocks away. Want to return your Alamo rental? The service at Union Square is a pleasant 1/2 mile walk. Need a bite? There is a huge range within 1/2 mile and mostly much closer. Common Sage offers Ramen. There's Middle Eastern inside the hotel and across the street. Two blocks further up Sutter is the Slider Diner for those that just want an excellent burger. Next to the hotel is the relaxing Miller's Rest. And my favorite, across Sutter and a few doors down is Le Marais open at 7:30 am with its French pastries (amazing pain aux raisins!) and hot coffee. Light lunches also available. Okay, SF MoMA is perhaps a bit too far to walk but there are busses and there are Ubers. So many Ubers.And the parks and Fine Arts Museums in them are a couple miles away or so, but parking is a headache and public transportation of some kind is a much better choice.The effect is a little shabby chic with a touch of South Asian color and a wee bit of camp. We were entirely happy with it. I would unquestionably stay again and recommend the place highly.","May 16, 2019","21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

1230,Stayed here for 2 nights during our tour of the west coast and its fairly average once you get past the reception. Rooms are basic and the bathroom facilities that of your standard budget hotel. Prices within San Francisco are very expensive so i will say this offered a good rate in comparison to those closer to fisherman’s wharf. I can say that the scent they use in the reception is amazing! It really makes you feel at home. A word of caution for guests venturing out at night! Its not in the nicest part of town. But be streetwise and you’ll be fine. All in all i think i’d spend a bit more and go closer to the action next time I’m in the Bay Area. ,"May 10, 2019","21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

1246,"I read a lot of reviews before booking at the Hotel Carlton. Some of the negative comments concerned me but I decided to take a chance because ""the price was right."" We were very pleased with our 3-night stay here. Upon check-in we received a warm and friendly welcome at the front desk (thank you, Theo). Our Deluxe King room was on the seventh floor and faced east toward the Financial District. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was spotless. In fact, the tile work and fixtures seemed to be brand new. The bath towels were oversized and absorbent. To address some of the negative comments I'd seen in other reviews: 1) yes, the walls do seem to be thin. On Saturday night of our stay there seemed to be a ""girls getaway weekend"" going on and we did hear voices through the wall. For the next two nights I believe there was a guest in the same room but we didn't hear a peep. 2) The neighborhood. We found the street to be quiet and safe and there were several really great restaurants and coffee shops within a few blocks. Just down the street we stumbled upon Chisme Cantina which was a new discovery to us and so delicious. It was also nice to have a Trader Joe's just a few blocks away to stock up on snacks and drinks. And as you walk up into Nob Hill the neighborhood is full of interesting nooks and crannies to explore.We found the other guests to be friendly and people seemed to enjoy being there. Overall, the hotel met all our needs and we'll be happy to stay there again.","March 29, 2019","21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

The bed was plush and comfortable and I slept well. Check-out was smooth and fast; I don't know how they recognized me, but I didn't even have to tell them my room number.

1292,"I really enjoyed staying at this property a few years ago and looked forward to visiting it again. Just like before, I willingly paid extra for an upgraded patio room - Room 103. In fact, I think I stayed in the same room the last time.Unfortunately, this time the HVAC system was defective. Whenever it would cycle on, approximately 4x/hour, it would make a huge noise. It literally sounded like someone tossing a metal trash can across a concrete driveway. This disruptive noise occurred 24x7.Also, the sliding glass door that opens onto the public patio could not be locked. After the little lever was moved into the locked position, any movement of the door handle or shaking of the door would cause the lock to disengage and become unlocked.The little bedside tables have nifty built-in outlets and USB charging ports. However, the table on one side of the bed contained defective ports - the bedside light worked fine so there was power to the table, but the ports were dead. Of course, my wife didn't notice that until the next morning when she discovered her plugged-in phone did not charge overnight. Lastly, the in-room refrigerator was barely cool... probably no colder than 55 degrees. There was no control knob or other means to adjust the temperature downward. I reported these problems to the front desk staff and the response was, ""Oh, I see... we'll have someone look at it."" The guy didn't take any notes or indicate surprise. I have to believe these things didn't mysteriously fail when I appeared. They were most probably on the maintenance list for a while but were simply ignored.Paying nearly $700 for two nights lodging with these deficiencies is unacceptable. As mentioned above, I stayed in this hotel previously and enjoyed my visit immensely. I wrote glowing reviews about that visit on social media praising the facility and staff. I do not plan to return to this hotel.","March 13, 2019","22    Kimpton Buchanan

1310,"Hotel- Kimpton Buchanan (San Francisco, CA) Date: 03jan2019 – 04jan2019Overall: Average. Japantown location. Friendly staff, Limited facilities. Accommodations- Average. We were assigned a Balcony King room. The bedding was enticing & comfortable, and the room contained the usual furniture. Some furniture should be repainted/maintained; the bathroom door had no handle or latch to keep closed. A refrigerator was provided but the usual Kimpton minibar was not present. The heater had limited functionality, only very limited space was available on the bathroom countertop for toiletries. The balcony, bed, & television met expectations. The carpet was in really good shape.Loyalty Program Recognition- Above Average/Very good. As a Kimpton Inner Circle member, my room was upgraded. A welcome amenity of chips, nuts, water, and 2 sodas which was present in the room upon arrival, and we were given branded cloth bags containing water, chips, nuts, & Kind bar, as a substitute for a minibar. No ‘Complementary Chefs Taste’ was applicable.Staff- Excellent. Ed, at the reception, was excellent; he checked us in and explained the hotels amenities and offerings, along with a handout of local stores for food & shopping; Prior to checkout, he helped with printing & faxing service. He was a model employee and deserves special kudos. Emily, the manager, was very kind and professional. The wine hour ‘sommelier’ could not pronounce the wine offerings. For this Kimpton, appetizers did not accompany the wine hour, but two select alcohols were.Housekeeping- Poor. The bathroom was not good. The tub had scum buildup around the sides and bottom, and on the floor at the bottom of baseboards, dirt was accumulating, in part due to flooring choice. A bug was smashed on the ceiling. The carpet appeared clean. Scuffs were present on the walls. The bed was clean in appearance.Pool/Gym: not evaluatedMeal Options-. Average. The restaurant Mums provided the only food and beverage available within the hotel, and no room service is offered. The food is excellent, in price, taste, & service. Unfortunately, not even a menu is available in the room; you must go to the restaurant to even check what is available. It is not a Kimpton restaurant, but can be charged to your room, we were told. A full mall is located across the street, as an alternative, during select hours.Laundry- Poor. No laundry price list was available. Not evaluated further.Computer/Printer/WiFi- Good. WiFi was strong, and video streaming was possible. No computer or printer were available; printing had to be done via emailing the front desk. Property Appearance- Good. Exterior- The building is seasoned. The entrance was inviting; steps leading downward bring you to the lobby & reception. Interior- The lobby was appealing. A ceiling artwork created from glass bottles captured my attention, many of the other decorative items and furniture were appropriate.","January 11, 2019","22    Kimpton Buchanan

I stumbled upon this place as I was googling French Hotels near me. As I went on their website, I was completely surprised that my stay included dinner at their lovely french restaurant on site as well as parking and breakfast! We didn't know what to expect. From the moment we parked we knew it was going to be a wonderful experience! The parking garage is literally right across the street from the hotel. We approached the front desk and the gentleman checking us in could not have been nicer! We were greeted by a beautiful golden retriever. Joseph, the bellman let us into our room and explained all the lovely art we were seeing. We felt spoiled! The room was a cute room with a view. Very comfortable beds. Every one we encountered were so friendly. During the dinner, a violinist played and when it came to dessert, there was a candle in it for my mom and the violinist played for her personally.

1317,"Stayed for two nights in the ""junior suite"". The rooms are small, but comfortable; the elevator -- straight from the 20's -- is charming; the location can't be beat. The more-accomplished-than-one-would-expect mini-murals are, dare I say, delightful :-) They certainly make the exploration of all the floors, and the downstairs, and the two sitting areas into an adventure. We also had a dinner at Jeanne de Arc restaurant in the bowels of the hotel which I will review separately. The minor quibbles are as follows: 1) the hotel has no room service, even for breakfast. I understand it's a bit of hassle, but breakfast hours are a bit short. 2) the ""room+dinner"" special ended up costing $50 more than simply booking a room and having dinner separately. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it was the very same standard prix fixe dinner.3) because they now only offer free breakfasts if the hotel is booked on their website (which is not a great website, by the way, with disappearing and re-appearing specials and unclear availability, but I digress) -- they have a system of little coupons that one must carry to have breakfast for free. It seems that saying your room number should be sufficient and the restaurant should get a daily list of the ""entitled"" rooms. It is precisely these points of friction that unnecessary detract from an otherwise excellent, friendly hotel. Would we stay there again? Certainly.","July 2, 2019","23    Cornell Hotel de France

1322,"In selecting this hotel, I did note the decorated walls and extensive range of artefacts throughout, all emphasising the french theme. Entering the hotel, the décor was initially a little overwhelming, with painted flowers on walls and ceilings everywhere, an enthusiastic homage to French impressionist art and in the restaurant, to Jeanne D’ Arc. Vases with fresh flowers are a welcome touch. The 1910 elevator is a piece of the history of the building. Located in Bush Street, the hotel is convenient to the cable car and it is an easy walk down to Union Square and major galleries. It is close to the Financial, Downtown and Nob Hill districts. There is definitely a French presence in this section of the city: there are restaurants, cafés and the Eglise Nôtre Dame des Victoires nearby. Throughout my stay, I gained a genuine appreciation of the excellent service and practical assistance with local information. This family run boutique hotel is small, cosy and friendly. Tea and coffee making is available in one’s room and downstairs next to the lobby. A comfortable lounge area is convenient to sit in and read the paper. Arriving too early to check in, I left my bags and went walking. On my return, my bags were in my room, my coat in the wardrobe for me.  Dinner in the Jeanne D’ Arc restaurant was a treat, and next day’s breakfast plentiful. Again the service was efficient and pleasant.

1326,"You don’t have to be a Francophile like me to find this hotel charming and a great found gem of a place for its great location, clean, quiet room and friendly staff.I found this hotel by chance after all the hotels catered to my convention were all booked out and I choose it for the price and its rating 8.9/10. I spent five nights here but had to move to Fairmont hotel, a 5 star hotel a block away for the 6th night when I decided too late to add on an extra night. I would give Cornell Hotel de France 9/10 and Fairmont 5/10 for its location and value. Cornell Hotel de France is 15 minutes walk to the convention; passing several coffee shops and eatery on the way as well as the cable car and neighborhood convenience stores are just blocks away. I would definitely look for this hotel for my next stay. I had sent this email to the establishment:Salut!C’était un grand plaisir de passer un petit séjour à Cornell Hotel De France.Je pourrais dire que j’ai trouvé un coin de la France dans le coeur de San Francisco.Merci bien et à la prochaine.L.

1328,"Having dined at the lovely Jeanne d'Arc restaurant at this hotel in the past, my husband and I decided to try the hotel, which came highly recommended. We were not disappointed. Our room on the sixth floor, overlooking Bush Street was reminiscent of Paris apartments that dominate the city. The old-style elevator is a treat! In the room, there was a small nook with a table and chairs for a nightcap, and the decor - wall fresques and French paintings- were a lovely touch. The cleanliness of the room and bathroom were impeccable. Most remarkable was how quiet this busy street became at night. We slept very well and heard no noise. Finally, this hotel is centrally located to the tourist mecca, Union Square, and offers an excellent rapport quality-price. A special thank you to ""Joe"", who personally carried our luggage and showed us to our room. We will be back!.","May 9, 2019","23    Cornell Hotel de France

It offers old world charm and the staff was pleasant and helpful, There are some gritty areas in the city at night, however, we felt fine walking back to this hotel from Union Square. A freshly prepared hot breakfast was included with our stay since we booked directly with the hotel. The coffee is excellent! They even offer gluten free bread for toast. It is served in the hotel's restaurant area located on the lower level which is not serviced by the elevator. Not a problem for us.

1330,"First of all, I highly recommend this hotel for those who wish to be in a central location in San Francisco. Our room is extremely clean and the hotel has all of the crucial things I look for--closets, coffee, full body mirror, chargers for both USB-type and plug-type devices on both sides of the bed, and a small table. It's perfect! The bathroom toiletries are all L'Occitane, which I really like--the scent of their shampoo is divine. There is artwork and stylish French-inspired decor everywhere you look and the ceilings/walls are artistically hand painted. Pretty impressive! They also offered valet parking just across the street with ""in-and-out"" privileges at a discounted rate. I've been to many hotels in Europe, North America and Asia. This place is head and shoulders above the rest. I highly recommend that you experience San Francisco while staying in this stylish hotel.","May 2, 2019","23    Cornell Hotel de France

1332,"Friends suggested we stay in this hotel for at least one of our nights in San Francisco, and it was not disappointing. The elevator is tiny as is common when they have them in Europe, but we enjoyed using the old stairs to the 2nd floor. Our room had a window overlooking a tiny, hidden pathway, and old style radiator heaters that fit the European decor. One caveat, we couldn't control the heat and our room was too warm, but when we asked the front desk sent a fan to our room. With it in the window it brought back memories of France. Service from the porter, the valet and the office personnel was friendly and efficient. We had other plans and didn't get a chance to eat in the cafe, but our friends recommend it and we plan to include it on another visit.","April 15, 2019","23    Cornell Hotel de France

There is no ramp through the front door for anyone wheelchair bound, but I was able to climb with assistance. Finding an room with two double beds was a huge bonus.

I had a ""salad"" that was a delicious flaky puff pastry with scallops inside and a sauce that was so good, that I'm still thinking about it a few times a day, over a week later! (the filet mignon was a little disappointing, though) Don't forget to get a discount card from the front desk when you are staying at the hotel. We only stayed one night, but we're so glad we did.

The hotel is a climb from Union Square and not as convenient as it may look on a map. Inside the hotel the stairs are steep and the elevator is iffy. At first I thought the dogs (there were at least two while we were there) were neat, but their barking at odd times was annoying. The rooms are heated by a radiator, which I like because it is a great type of heat, but no room controls meant our room in the back was often very cold with no way to warm up with a note telling us not to attempt to adjust. Although the room was advertised with breakfast, it seemed to be a simple coffee and toast affair in a cramped and crowded room. We skipped and went down to Sears Fine Foods for an enjoyable experience. I would return, but only if no other options were in the area.","January 27, 2019","23    Cornell Hotel de France

1367,Our room was super small and had maybe 1-2 feet of space from the bed to either wall. Our window was facing a brick wall which was unfortunate but at least we weren't in the room much. Super quiet and surprisingly large and clean bathroom in our unit. The receptionists and doorman were all very friendly. The elevator was a cute surprise as it's the old french style ones with a door you have to open. You can't beat the price for the location though (2 blocks from Union Square). Great cafe and restaurant just right across the street. Parking at the garage across the street is $36 (includes tax) paid to the hotel which includes in and out privileges.,"December 9, 2018","23    Cornell Hotel de France

1368,"We were planning to be in San Francisco for one night during our recent road trip and wanted somewhere clean, safe, and not ridiculously expensive. After reading countless reviews of many properties, we settled on the Coventry Motor Inn and booked a room with 2 beds for our family of 4. The free parking, free WiFi, and location were all extremely appealing. Some reviews mentioned street noise and small rooms, but we weren't bothered by any noise (our room was facing the street and we brought a small white noise machine) and thought the room was very spacious with a separate seating area of a loveseat and a table and chairs. The bathroom came with toiletries and there was a coffee pot/coffee as well. The iron and ironing board worked like a charm. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean. The rooms are dated, but it wasn't stuffy or dusty or musty. We appreciated the air conditioning. The men working at the desk when I called prior to our stay and at check in/check out were very friendly. Our room happened to be ready prior to check in time, which was great for us. And they had no problem with us leaving our car until the evening on the day we checked out while we continued exploring the city. The Coventry Motor Inn was a very pleasant surprise and we would absolutely recommend it and stay here again for sure. We thought it deserved all the good reviews and was even better than a lot of them made it seem!","July 10, 2019","24    Coventry Motor Inn

1369,Good location. Well maintained property. Parking on site. Staff was terrific. Clean.Loads of restaurants in a 5 block area. I would definitely stay here again. If you're traveling to SF this summer be aware that some hotels do not have air conditioning. Coventry HAS air conditioning but does not serve breakfast. Ask for a room away from the street - it can get a little noisy in the morning.,"June 12, 2019","24    Coventry Motor Inn

The only drawback is that there was no parking the night we arrived and that is one of the things that attracted me to this Inn.

1374,"If you're looking for a good value and a good location in the city, here is your spot. We stayed here for three days and it served as a good jumping off point for sight seeing each day. The rooms are 'standard', but they get the job done. There is a separate table and chairs to sit at, so you don't have to sit on the bed all the time, which I appreciate. I would say the rooms could use a couple more outlets for charging purposes though. I travel with a power strip, so I was fine.As far as location goes, this hotel has FREE PARKING, which in the city is a plus! We left our car here and took a Lyft to the tourist areas most days, and due to the central location, each ride was less than $10...way less than the parking fees down at Pier 39, etc. In all, I would recommend staying here...I'd do it again.","April 23, 2019","24    Coventry Motor Inn

1375,"It’s not entirely clear to me how this place gets so many good reviews. I can only assume that they bought them. It is basically a motel with zero facilities and character to match. When I got out of the lift on my floor there was a funky smell which may or may not have been caused by the huge stain coming from underneath one of the vending machines there. This smell was still evident in my room. It faded over the days but I may just have got used to it.The room itself was OK. It was dark and outdated but the bed was comfortable enough and the WiFi worked well. In the bathroom the shower pipe came out of the wall at an odd angle which made showering a bit awkward.The real problem with the place, however, seems to be the management. When I attempted to negotiate a late checkout, the manager became rude and aggressive and could not have been less accommodating. In the end he suggested I should check out there and then. I couldn’t believe my ears. I have never been spoken to in such a way by any hotel staff. Not content with being a miserable jobsworth in person the manager chose to follow up on this by putting a nasty little note under my door the next morning. He also attempted to ruin my day by refusing to store my bag. How petty!! Fortunately, the hotel next door was happy to oblige.There never seemed to be many people around so I imagine that the place is on its last legs financially. I intend to help it on its way by never staying there again and I suggest you do the same.","April 21, 2019","24    Coventry Motor Inn

1377,"Clean, spacious room, although a bit drab, as reported by other reviewers. The bed is very comfortable; nice big t.v., hair dryer, toiletries, drip coffee pot and coffee, iron and ironing board are in the room. We arrived probably an hour or so before check-in time of 3:00, and they did not hesitate to allow us to check-in early. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is very safe and just a couple of blocks to several restaurants. We ate breakfast both mornings at Mel’s Diner, just down Lombard Street. The hotel is in walking distance to the curvy part of Lombard Street, but I would recommend against walking (uphill) to it; catch a cable car to it from Fisherman’s wharf, instead, and walk (downhill) back to the hotel. My husband and I are in good shape, and it’s not the distance but the crazy incline of that section of Lombard street that will challenge you. We took an Uber to catch the ferry one morning, and it was about $10, I believe. You could certainly walk it, but we opted ride to insure that we got there on time...stress-free. Our room faced Lombard street, and the traffic noise was loud in the evening but quieted by the time we were settling in to sleep. I would certainly recommend this hotel for your stay in San Francisco. The hotel has a good size parking garage attached, but we did not have a vehicle.","April 11, 2019","24    Coventry Motor Inn

Not many food places near but the Fisherman s Wharf was not too far away. If you can walk or get an Uber. The motel is great. Its clean and has everything you need .bed was really comfy and we slept like logs every night of our 4 night stay. The staff were really helpful and on site all night. Parking on site was really good. There was a little convenience store right across the street and we made the most of that.

1379,"This is seriously a no-frills, dated hotel. It was clean and conveniently located. The desk staff were all very pleasant and helpful. It was about 2 blocks to a bus stop, which we used rather than trying to park in various places. Bed was very comfortable. Cable quit working, due to equipment issues in building, so we were without a TV for 1/2 of our stay. Furnishings and decor looked to be from the 80s. One main draw was the free parking, which is difficult to come by. We chose the free parking over a place that had free breakfast. It seemed a little high still, for what it was, but it wasn't bad. I'd consider it a possibility if we were in San Francisco again.","April 1, 2019","24    Coventry Motor Inn

It had no restaurant and it would have helped if there had been a fridge in the room so that we could breakfast in the room. But within 5 to 10 minutes walk, there was a good selection of cafes for breakfast and other meals in Union and Chestnut Streets which were lovely shopping areas too. We were also around 10 minutes walk from Greens Restaurant which is a delicious vegetarian restaurant. We were able to travel on buses - the stops were a few minutes walk away - into town. It took about 20 - 30 minutes. I thought the area in which the hotel was located was excellent and felt safe, even when walking around at night. The reception staff at the hotel were very helpful and allowed early check in and a later departure.

Even though it's on a busy street, we didn't hear much noise because our room was on the backside of the hotel, facing the quiet neighborhood and streets. We were awoken by some trash trucks early in the morning but nothing too loud. Later on, more noise due to street construction, but not a big deal. There was no fridge or microwave in the room. This is a no pet, non smoking hotel, which I appreciate. Parking is free and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance (5 minute walk) The room is spacious, as well as the bathroom.

1384,"I stayed here for a few nights during the end of the year. The hotel does not serve breakfast, but does have free parking! I searched extensively but free parking is a rarity in San Francisco. Location: There is a good restaurant nearby where you can get great breakfast, it’s called Mel’s diner and is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. As an added bonus, this diner has the retro diner feel as you would see in some movies. The famous Lombard street is a 30 minute walk (partly uphill). You can get to the golden gate park with Lyft or Uber for around 16$. I wouldn’t recommend driving yourself in San Francisco due to the high parking prices and break-ins are a real danger in San Francisco. From the Golden Gate Bridge you can take bus 28 which will take you in 10-15 minutes to the hotel. Tickets for this bus can be purchased via the “muni” app (2.50$ for a ride) or via the driver (2.75$ per ride). Even fishermans wharf is a 30-35 minute walk. The hotel staff: Mo of the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Other staff members were also very friendly. Nothing to complain about that!The lobby is essentially located in the first floor of the parking garage, but there is also an underground floor. I read some reviews complaing about the parking garages being very narrow. However with our SUV Jeep Cherokee parking was quite easy. The room itself: the rooms and the hotel are a little old, but well maintained and propely cleaned. The airconditioning/heating might sometimes make a little noise, but nothing too major. You can easily sleep through it. The beds were also very comfortable!The price: the price might seem steep for a hotel, but if you look at the price level of hotels in San Francisco, this price is almost the lowest you can get for a decent hotel. On top of that there is free parking which will cost you around $60 per day in other hotels!","January 6, 2019","24    Coventry Motor Inn

1389,"We stayed here recently during our quick trip through the Bay area. We chose Coventry based on the reviews, the value pricing and our desire to explore the neighborhoods a bit more than just frequenting tourist spots and union square. We typically stay in nicer chain hotels but decided to try something different this time. The skinny: the hotel is decent but no frills, clean and well maintained for sure but make no mistake - definitely budget so it depends if this is for you. It was a reasonable experience overall for us but definitely marred by the check-in experience. After a long drive from the central coast, we were tired but grateful to be in SF. However the front-desk staff, a crusty old gentleman by the name of 'Vince' literally growled at us when we appeared for check-in. He was literally cursing under his breathe as he checked us in and could not have made us as guests feel more uncomfortable, we were glad to be done with him. Courtesy note to management - attitude makes all the difference in the world, please staff the front desk with individuals who actually care about service. Note to Vince - if you don't like people please do not work in the hospitality industry, simple as that. Fortunately, there all kinds and stripes in this world and the rest of the staff we bumped into during our trip from housekeeping to when we checked out were pleasant and courteous. We enjoyed our few days in SF, the location of Coventry Inn is quite good and you are only blocks from Chestnut street which has plenty of dining and shopping choices. A few tips, there is underground parking entry by the side of the building, it isn't only what you see on street level and go for a room facing away from the main street.","November 17, 2018","24    Coventry Motor Inn

There's a bike rental facility right next door, so we rented bikes and rode all over (it's quite the workout going up the hills). But it is close to Fisherman's Wharf and restaurants. There are coffee shops that are walking distance as well. The room was spacious and clean. A little noisy because our room was right on Lombard street. But overall a good place to stay!","July 5, 2018","24    Coventry Motor Inn

1405,"First time in San Francisco and we were not expecting much from this small inn even though the reviews were mostly good. It turned out to be better than we expected! For motels and inns in SFO, the room in this inn was considered a good size for 2-4 persons. We didn't mind the dated furniture as the beds were comfy and clean. We were lucky to get the room facing the side street so it wasn't as noisy as those facing the main street. But the walls and doors were quite thin so you can hear voices and sounds if other guests talked loudly. No breakfast here but there are some eateries within walking distance if you care to explore. Most of all, the staff are friendly and helpful in giving directions or recommending good eating places. Will definitely stay here again if we visit San Francisco in future.

The mattresses are double covered in mattress protectors, so you would not be able to tell unless you spent an hour taking out the mattress. They deducted $50 from our stay and put our clothes through their commercial dryer. When I asked how they would get rid of the bed bugs, they said they do a deep clean of all rooms every couple months. Only serious heat and fumigation will get rid of bed bugs.

1408,"We stayed two nights in a 2 queen room with sofa. We chose this property in large part due to the free parking for our rental car. We arrived before check-in for our first night (around noon). Mo graciously allowed us to park early so we could attend a Giants game. He also extended our parking time period for after our check-out because our flight departed late that night. Both of these gestures were greatly appreciated. We liked how our room was laid out, nice bathrooms, and extra seating. We were able to use the Muni very easily from a block or less walk from the property. However, we had a broken commitment about our room request. Mo had arranged, per our request at booking time, to have a room away from Lombard St due to noisiness. Upon arrival, pre-check-in time, there was a room scheduled to be available that fit that criteria but still being cleaned. We were promised we would get that room and not room 315 which was on the corner facing Lombard St. When we returned around 7, we were given room 315 by Vince since it was the only room left. Room 315 was incredibly noisy from the street traffic, and not even earplugs could completely block it out. This room needs to have a white noise or other background sleep noise machine. You can request a room away from Lombard St, but be sure to arrive promptly at check-in time for the best chance to get it.","June 1, 2018","24    Coventry Motor Inn

We initially stayed in union square when we first arrived in the stated but found it very busy. This motel is a no fuss place to stay in a safe area. A short walk to restaurants and bars. We used uber everywhere and when we ordered a car it would Leah’s take less than a 5 mins for the car to arrive. Decor is abit old but for the price you pay and the time spent In your room it is a bargain. Spoke to the front desk and they informed us that they have recently replaced all their beds. The bed we had was one of the best we had on our entire trip!! Mo at the front desk was great very friendly and very welcoming. Highly recommended ,"April 18, 2018","24    Coventry Motor Inn

We flew in to Oakland, took the BART to San Francisco, and the bus to Motor Inn. It was a two block walk from the bus to the Inn. We were early for check in, but they checked our bags, and off we went. Back to the bus stop and a five minute ride, we were at the wharf. And a very easy return. The rooms were a little dated, but clean and roomy. There were not a lot of amenities, but that's not why we were in San Francisco. This is mostly a residential area so it was pretty quiet. Near by there was a whiskey martini bar, but we were too busy to visit it this time. For the money there is now way you could beat this hotel.

We had seen it on previous visits, but we’re pleasantly surprised at how centrally located it is. It’s a small boutique hotel, and does not serve breakfast, although there’s coffee in the lobby in the mornings and a wine happy hour in the late afternoon. However, one of our favorite bakeries/breakfast and lunch places, La Boulangerie, is literally across the intersection from the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, both at check-in and when we had requests afterwards. They also have a “joyfully green” program, where there is partial service to help conserve energy (and really,who needs their room vacuumed every day?) which we opted for most days. We did have an inside room, meaning that it opened on the atrium and did not have street noise, and we heard someone at the desk asking to be moved, so perhaps it’s important to request an inside room.

The air conditioner didn't work ( they did fix it but that should have been checked before selling the room). The toilet overflowed all over the floor. It's ok but it's not a 4 star hotel.

Super shout-out to Jeffrey Rosenkrantz (perhaps the very best front office manager ever), Suzie, Jared, Jessie, and Joao, all of whom provided exceptional service. Friendly without being sappy and professional without being officious. Room was better than most San Francisco rooms, especially for the price. Free cocktail hour was an extra bonus.

1457,"When I arrived at the hotel after a long day travelling, it was the best feeling ever! The warm welcome and cosy reception was just what we were looking for. The location was brilliant - The hotel was really close to the metro stop for the train from the airport and there was a supermarket just over the road. There was also an Amazon Go store round the corner, which my husband was excited about! It's also within walking distance of China Town and Union Square, including the stops for the cable car and sightseeing bus. There did seem to be a lot of homeless around but think that's a problem everywhere in San Francisco.The receptionists were so friendly, really helpful with any questions we had and always said hello / goodbye as we arrived / left. Another highlight was wine hour every day! We missed it when we first arrived and they sent some wine up to the room. There was also free tea and coffee available in the mornings. The room on the small side but the bed was so comfy. Unfortunately, I had requested for no feather bedding due to allergies and we had feathers when we arrived. Although they did sort it out quickly. The room was a bit dusty in places and it was noisy with traffic and people so take you ear plugs! The wifi was good and there were lots of plugs for charging things! Nice touch with a torch in the room. There was a safe & a lovely big shower with nice cosmetics!There's a nice garden & walking track in the hotel but we didn't use it.There was a room tax but I think it's reasonable considering the pros of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.","May 24, 2019","25    Galleria Park Hotel

1464,"I booked a twin room and requested a rollaway bed for our party of three 3 months prior to arrival through Expedia. Upon arrival after a long flight from the UK, I was told they could not accommodate the rollaway bed in a twin due to fire regulations - which I accept. However, they could see my request on their system yet no-one thought to contact me so that I could make alternative arrangements. Instead they told me that I would have to book a separate room - effectively doubling what I had already paid. It was their error, which they admitted and were apologetic, however to expect a customer to just pay for a second room on he spot due to their error is absolutely unfair. They were not willing to offer any discount except waive the resort fee for the room. The whole situation caused so much stress and ruined the first day of our trip - that we had been looking forward to for months. I cancelled my booking with them and booked an Airbnb instead. Was probably the same price as two rooms but I didn’t want to give Galleria Park Hotel my money out of principle.","April 21, 2019","25    Galleria Park Hotel

1468,"Overall this hotel was a great choice. It was in a location close to restaurants and not far from the piers. Being in the business district it felt a bit quiet at night on the weekends but it was still a good location and easy to navigate to and from. Upon our arrival they were just finishing up cocktail hour in the lobby and offered us a drink as we checked in. The hotel was nicely decorated and had a comfortable lobby space with chairs and tables, perfect when meeting up with friends staying in different rooms. Housekeeping did a nice job every day as well. I would recommend this hotel.The only thing I would say wasn't fantastic was the size of the room and bathroom - super small but when I looked at the floor map it appeared that our room was among the smallest on the floor. Also, we were on the 8th floor but still could hear lots of outside noise (garbage and recycling handling) in the early hours.

As you all know the steep hills of San Fran can be tough and this hotel is located on one.Check in was amazing Michael at the front gave me a great room over looking the garden. The o Ly odd thing about the room was the bathroom door opened out to block the hotel room door. So if you left the bathroom door open and someone walked in the doors collided into each other.The rooms were clean and roomy. The garden is spectacular. I worked outside every morning while getting some great vitamin D. The bartenders in the hotel restaurant were great.

1482,"The Fairmont San Francisco is a beautiful hotel conveniently located. We stayed in a double bed room which was quite nice with good sized rooms and bathrooms. However, for what you pay for a room here you'd think what I would call ""standard"" amenities would be included (e.g. WiFi and fitness facility access). Instead, both these costs extra which I think is ridiculous.Also annoying was the fact that it took quite some time for the water to get hot in the bathroom, and the faucet in the sink was set too far back in the sink bowl.  You couldnt even wash your hands without hitting the back of the sink bowl. This could easily be remedied with a longer spout on the faucet. I also found it surprising that the front desk didn't have an Ethernet cable available when we asked.  My kids wanted to hook up their Xbox and this required an Ethernet cable to access the hotel's sign in page (you couldn't access the sign in page on wifi with the Xbox). Further, the bell man at front didn't give proper advice on Uber stops for getting to the start of the Golden gate bridge, which resulted in us paying more than we needed to for the Uber. I know this couldn't have been the first time someone asked where to stop in order to walk across the GG bridge.  So overall a nice hotel, but for the money I would expect the ""extras"" and better knowledge from the bell service.","July 2, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

When I went down to get assisted by the concierge, Payal was ready, willing to assist and was amazing. She made some recommendations and booked some excursions for us.The following time we needed services of the concierge and we made contact with the legendary Mr. Thomas Wolfe, wow! what a gentleman. The passion for his role reflects in the way he deals with guests, making each guest feel important /special and attention to detail and the professionalism of his communication and feedback is worth mentioning. All I can say to those working in his team, WATCH and LEARN!The fact that the hotel has a complimentary car service to transport within San Fran puts this hotel above its competitors/to another level, yes I know its based on"" first come, first serves' or availability but its available for guests to use it and we managed to use it when we really needed it.Then, the nightly wine down was just a great treat and the beautiful way of ending your day before going out for the evening or dinner, although, I would recommend a variety in wines but the cheese platters were amazing with good quality product. some locally sourced. The rooms were serviced daily by friendly and attentive staff however I was disappointed that a hotel of this caliber didn't have a turndown services and hotel slippers. Furthermore, if you are going to provide your guest with complimentary tea and coffee ( NB: great tea selection and coffee) , it would make sense to also provide them with complimentary water.Lastly, you really need to look at your breakfast selection and how its served. We had breakfast at the hotel only once and the other days we opted for eating out. The cost of it, is really not worth what it is served.

1484,"The Fairmont is a beautiful, historic hotel built in 1907. The location in Nob Hill is very nice and centrally located. We stayed in a junior suite in the main tower. It was beautiful and had a large sitting room with pull-out couch (the kids said it was comfy for sleeping) and a separate master bedroom with a king bed. The balcony was spacious with 4 chairs and overlooked the rooftop garden. The bathrooms are small but they placed a nice storage tower in the corner and the closet nearby is spacious. The lobby is all marble and very beautiful. We ate breakfast in the hotel each morning. The buffet is $35 for adults and $17 for children. They also have a kids menu with items around $8. Buffet is pretty standard... omelet station, pancakes, bacon, sausage, bagel/toast, pineapple, cantaloupe and strawberries. Be sure to have a drink or meal in the Tonga room on the lower level. We didn't eat there so I can't speak to the food, but it is a unique, fun experience. What used to be the hotel pool decorates the middle of the room and a ""thunderstorm"" happens inside the restaurant every 15 minutes or so. It is decorated like a ship with a Hawaiian theme.Also, check out the rooftop garden. There is corn hole and beautiful flowers as well as some nice couches to sit and enjoy the weather and views.Getting around from the hotel: It is too far to walk to the main tourist attractions, however both lines of the cable car have a stop next to the hotel. For $12 you can purchase a MUNI pass on your phone and ride the cable car unlimited for the day. An uber will cost between $6 to $15 each way to some of the ""main spots"" like Lombard, Little Italy, Pier 33 for Alcatraz, Fisherman's wharf, California museum, and the Presido beach area. There is also a Hertz rental car desk inside the hotel but be aware parking is $75 a night.

All in all, we were beyond satisfied with our stay and can’t wait to come back on our next trip. Thanks Fairmont Hotel!","June 27, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1489,"The hotel is a landmark. It’s beautiful inside. The room(s) we had were clean and comfortable, but boy.... for being a “4-5 star hotel,” this was one of the most disappointing experiences I’ve ever had. Pros: Clean, super friendly staff, good and timely food from room service. And that’s about it. We love the history of the hotel, and Nob Hill is a great location. Cons: 1st room - the AC didn’t work. It took hours before someone finally came up to check it out. The mechanic that came up was very nice and helpful. It was mainly the fact that the front desk kept telling us they would call us back. Meanwhile, our room was 80 degrees and stifling. We called several times before my fiancé had to get very stern. Finally that’s when the mechanic came up. They ended up moving us to an upgraded room, which sufficed. 2nd room - After hours of walking around San Francisco’s hilly roads, we come to our room to find that our keys are not working. We sit in the hallway by the elevators for about ten minutes after speaking with the front desk. A guy comes up with two new keys, not very apologetic, and tries to open our room with the new keys they made. Surprise, surprise.. these keys aren’t working either. “If my key doesn’t work, I’ll have to get engineering to come check it out.” Really? And what should we do? Sit in the hallway and wait? Like WTH. Sweet guy from engineering comes up, changes battery, and keys still won’t work. So we are stuck sitting here. Front desk could seriously take some customer service manner lessons from the engineering department. Those guys were apologetic and tried to be so accommodating. For the amount of money we spent, I just expect the bar to be raised. If I’d spent a few hundred less per night, this kind of stuff happening, combined with the front desk’s lack of hospitality would have been expected. When you spend money to stay in a place like this, you expect the highest level of service, and that’s just not what we felt we received. Again, the guys from engineering were the best part of the customer service that we received. One more thing - the first room we had, had amazing shower and water pressure. The second, which was a suite, had the worst water pressure ever. They had a little sign in the bathroom about low water pressure shower heads and preserving water. I am ALL FOR preserving our resources and not wasting water, but my showers took twice as long because I could barely rinse the soap from the hair. Just another thing that was annoying and made no sense. So, as beautiful as the hotel is, the rich history, and cleanliness, next time we come to San Fran, we will be looking at another hotel.

1490,"It's unfortunate to pay my money and for the past two days. I am not able to sleep. We complain to the front desk and they refused to switch this lady to a different and smaller room. If you have someone who snores so loud, you would think they will switch her to a smaller room and keep the bigger room full. Or make her pay for a private room since this doesn't bother one person. This is horrible","June 25, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1491,"Hubby and I stayed after a long tiring day, only to found that the room they gave initially was not cleaned. We were about to drink water when we found messy goblet(see photo) with wine. Also, we found spider webs inside the closet and bathroom was dirty. I called several times after 40 minutes, finally somebody answered my call to request to switch room. They moved us to 5th floor with roughly the same size. We were just so tired to request another upgrade and just ended up sleeping instead. Very sad and disappointed with breakfast buffet as well, we just enjoyed the fruits and paid 85 dollars. In summary, it is not the service and accomodation that we are expecting from a 4/5 star hotel in the SFO Bay unfortunately.","June 23, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1492,We spent 4 nights here while visiting the wonderful city and had an awesome time. When we arrived at the hotel it was in lock down with secret service everywhere. It was the same the next day when we arrived back after an exhausting day exploring the city's delights. Apparently the Polish President was also staying at the Fairmont - if it's good enough for him then it's good enough for us. Check in was very easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. We had a walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom was a little on the small side with the shower over the bath. The room was spotless and we had a reasonable but restricted view of the bay. There was a very good selection for breakfast with a choice from the buffet or from the menu but expensive. We also availed of the restaurant in the evening. I don't normally like to single out an employee but one waiter called Rami in the restaurant was exceptional. We received VIP treatment from him every time we dined there. The hotel is located at the top of the famous Nob Hill (which we walked up twice) and all 3 cable car routes stop outside it. It is close to China Town and the Union Square shopping centre but about 3 and a half miles from Fisherman's Wharf - all down hill. We would definitely stay at the Fairmont again.,"June 22, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1495,"I am still processing the experience of staying here. We upgraded from a queen/queen room to a main building balcony suite upon check in. Initially things were great. The balcony really is beautiful and quite large. However, the first night we were awoken at 1am by the sound of the guests in the adjoining room having incredibly loud intimate relations. I was shocked by how much we could hear through the wall. I called down to make a noise complaint and was told they would send someone up to knock. I have no idea if that happened but approximately 5min later we could hear the phone ringing in their room, and again 10min after that. Once again, it essentially sounded as if we were in the same room as them. We eventually fell back asleep but again, at 7am the next morning, could clearly hear the guests next door engaged in the same activity. At that point I called down and requested to be moved to a different room immediately. I wasn't particularly impressed with how the hotel handled the situation. They made it seem like they were doing us a favor by allowing us to move rooms. I appreciate the fact that they cannot control who stays in adjoining rooms, however the original price of a balcony suite is almost $800/night. The walls are basically paper thin. And it wasn't as if the room next door was playing music, we had to listen to strangers having sex. I hate to think of what would have happened if a child was staying in our room. We were eventually moved to a tower suite. We had no issues with with noise after moving and the views were quite nice.In addition to the noise issues, when we checked out I was told I had a balance owing of $900. I found this confusing as I had paid in full when I booked (through the Fairmont website). The woman at the front desk informed me that it was my room upgrade charges...however it shouldn't have been anywhere near $900. I paid the bill because we had to get to the airport but when I arrived home I called the hotel to get some clarity. I had to speak to three different employees (none of whom could explain the charges) until I was connected with the Assistant Rooms Division Manager. She also could not explain the charges and asked me to send her a email with my original booking. Within 24hrs, she had replied that it was an error on their end and they have overcharged me by over $300 (!). As a gesture of goodwill they refunded my destination fee ($30/night). I was shocked that such a situation could happen, and if I hadn't been persistent about the incorrect charges, I would have had to pay!The hotel itself is very beautiful and the location is great. I had read rave reviews of the customer service at the Fairmont San Francisco, unfortunately I didn't experience any of it. I would recommend taking a close look at your bill upon checking out.","June 19, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1504,"We stayed in this hotel from 13th to 17th of April 2019 in two signature king tower rooms with panoramic view. The hotel used to be of a high standard maybe ten years ago, however it is not the case now. To begin with, we were checked in with over an hour delay to one room and even with more delay to our second room. Thus, after a long flight from London, UK, we had to wait in a lobby for additional 1.5 hrs. Not a good start, I must say! Secondly, the hotel itself leaves a biter impression of warn out/outdated building, with dirty windows (there was no point really for us to pay extra for panoramic view for that reason). Room service at night? Not in Fairmoint, unfortunately. All of the above is far from what you expect from 5* hotel. But what was the most surprising yet disappointing is they way how management handled our complain: in a defensive, aggressive manner as if we had no right to ask for a slippers in the room, cup of tea at 1 am or were meant to sit in a lobby past check in deadline. AccorHotels had definitely lowered the bar and made one of the formerly best hotels in SF below average yet it cost a fortune. ","June 10, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1506,"This was our second stay at the lovely Fairmont San Francisco, perched atop Nob Hill, just to the north of Union Square, but sitting above it. We were back in San Francisco for a series of business meetings for my wife, and predicated on our previous stay in March, we returned in November, before heading to London for more meetings. We are also Fairmont Gold members, so there are usually a few nice “perks,” from the hotel chain.We arrived in the early afternoon, and checked in. We were assigned Room 1006.The Hotel:This Fairmont Hotel is located 950 Mason St, and sort of “overlooks” the City of San Francisco, and down toward Union Square. It is an wonderfully elegant building, both inside and out, and harkens to a more glorious time for travel. “Opulent” is the first word, which comes to my mind. While it is an historic hotel, it has been refurbished, and modernized in many ways, so while basically older, it does not lack for the accouterments that one expects from a luxury hotel nowadays. One of those accouterments is the in-room tablet, which control several functions in the room, and also acts as a “personal concierge” service for the hotel, and near-by dining and entertainment.We got to see many things, which we had missed on our previous stay.Room 1006:Room 1006 had an entrance foyer, a very comfortable King bed, with nice pillows (an issue for me, at so many hotels), a nice bathroom w/ walk-in shower (ideal for my wife, with two artificial hips) and a soaking tub, but only a single sink, with small horizontal flat space around it. The small sink/vanity area was one of the few weaknesses in the room. There was a desk, and chest-of-drawers, with a large, flat-screen TV. The décor was “turn of the previous century elegant,” but the furniture was much, much newer, and in great shape. While not the most spacious room we have had, it was more than adequate, and would have been comfortable for a much longer stay.Our view was different this time, but still lovely, and probably one of the most impressive aspects of the view, was the tower section of the Fairmont.We had more than ample storage areas (remember, this was a very short trip/stay), and could easily have accommodated a week’s worth of clothing. We had a safe, iron and ironing board, and a full compliment of Rose 31 amenities in the bathroom. This is the standard Fairmont line of bath amenities, and we find them very nice.We had plenty of AC outlets, and most were near horizontal surfaces, so plugging in a handful of devices, for charging, was easy.Room 1006 was very quiet (as was the entire property), and we heard zero noise from either the outside (even with the California Cable Car Line beside the building), or inside the hotel. The air conditioning system was very quiet too.The Property:As this was in early November, the lobby still had some of the Halloween pumpkins (including some from the employees’ pumpkin-carving contest), but the hotel was transitioning to Christmas, and a “dine-in” gingerbread house was being constructed in the lobby. Even in the transitional state, the common areas were lovely.We printed out our boarding passes for our upcoming flight at one of several computer stations in the lobby, and my wife got to do some shopping on-property, at the various retail stores, just off of the grand lobby.Roof-top garden was lovely..During our brief stay, we had the opportunity to dine on property, and also visit the bar off of the lobby.The Location:The Fairmont is located atop Nob Hill. which can be a bit steep, depending on where one is coming from..On this stay, we did not use any transportation to/from the hotel, beyond our driver taking us from/to SFO for flights, but on the past stay, the doorman always got my wife a taxi, within moments. Due to its proximity to two other major hotels, there are plenty of taxis on Nob Hill, and good Uber/Lyft service too.Conclusion:We had but few interactions with staff, but each was excellent, as the staff was friendly, welcoming and fulfilled our every need.In summary, this was a wonderful, though albeit too short stay, and I am just glad that my wife finally had the time to explore this grand property. We will be returning.","June 7, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1518,"This hotel was booked on a room only basis as part of a honeymoon package. The hotel is in the Nob Hill district and therefore more expensive than we would usually book. Location is ideal for visiting the city. 2 of the cable car lines have stops right near the hotel or it’s a half hour (max) walk down the hill to the bay. For a top end hotel however, it was disappointing that there is no free WiFi in the rooms. The lobby does have WiFi that lasts for a day. All the staff are lovely & helpful and the room was clean & services well. We did splash out on room service on the first night as we arrived late evening. Although they didn’t have the pasta option I had chosen, an alternative was offered. The food arrived in a reasonable time and was hot. On our last day we were able to leave our luggage safely while we went out until it was time to leave. We ordered the airport shuttle that is advertised by link on the website & on the Fairmont ipaddevice in the room. That was a poor experience as the shuttle is a minibus which has seen better days. The driver seemed rushed and had multiple collections which we had planned poorly. We circled back on ourselves several times downtown & it was packed. The seats were small & we were squashed in. The seat belts were a revelation! Definitely stick to Uber next time. We paid $48 coming from the airport plus tip. The shuttle was $38 for the 2 of us.

The front desk on arrival, and the concierge when we asked about a concert were indifferent, the only time the front desks ears picked up was when I informed then on the day we left that we had observed a take away container with left over food at the top on the fire exit stairs visible through the glass door when we arrived and it was still there 7 days later! We did have one breakfast in the restaurant, which was OK if you think $28 for continental buffet is good value, maybe it is for San Francisco. The room, we had one on the mezzanine; was comfortable, it had half a window which was ok, but as with any city with low floors you do get noise, including feeling the vibration from what I suspect were the cables for the cable cars when they start up at approx. 6am we had no need for an alarm, maybe I was sensitive to it. On a positive note it is in a very good location, close to the cable cars as I might have previously intimated.","May 19, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1521,"I was really disappointed by this hotel. We previously stayed in the Fairmont Miramar in Santa Monica, which was not great, but this was even worse. Quite frankly, the service in this hotel is below their standard and charges. I was already unpleasantly surprised by all the taxes being charged in California, but here they add another 30$ every day for ‘hotel services’ like WiFi or the Spa facilities. Even if not used, you are penalized for the heavy overheads in this hotel.The check-in experience was also very bad. We arrived late around 23.00h and finally after visiting the 3rd option room we were satisfied. The guy at the reception was really bad and not helpful at all. One of his colleagues finally solved the problem. Really terrible. No, this was not what we expected, but it seems the ‘standard’ in Fairmont properties.","May 17, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

The check in process was really quick and smoothly, friendly friendly staff from the concierge till the housekeeping.The room was quite spacious, with king size bed and an office to work. I did not tried the breakfast(as with all the taxes the rate was a lit of bit high) but on the ground floor it has a coffee shop for take away with excellent coffee croissant etc. The location for me is the best as it is walk able 15 minutes from the union square and not noisy at all. if i ever have the opportunity to go back to San Fransisco probably i would book again here","May 13, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1529,"Our family stayed at the Fairmont for two nights using an Amex Platinum rate over easter weekend. We booked the lowest rate rooms, had free breakfast and a $100 resort credit. For breakfast they give you $44 per person which covered us easily including juice, latte's, etc. The buffet was satisfactory for a hotel of this class, not particularly amazing. Service was good, seating was plentiful and the venue is attractive. There were two Easter brunches as well, we did not attend either. There was also an egg hunt that looked cute but our kids are way too old sadly. Our rooms were on the 6th floor and had beautiful views of the Bay (I think) Bridge, city and the water. Comfy beds, nice decor. The hotel is older and I did hear noise from the hallway on a few occasions though the hotel tries to encourage a 'quiet time' from 10pm to 8 am. The location of the hotel is excellent as far as I am concerned and if you like to walk, it is at the top of a STEEP hill. The hill top is spectacular with a darling park, historic church and several stately older building. A respite from some of the seedier and busier parts of the city. The trolly is right there to take you up and down the hill and other BART stops. We used Uber for the most part and never had to go much further than 15 minutes. We have stayed in other areas and find this location to be much more pleasant than the hotels in the downtown area. We would definitely choose The Fairmont or also The Ritz over other locations in the city.","May 1, 2019","26    Fairmont San Francisco

1531,"I booked the Green Tortoise Hostel for a one-night stay for $47. It’s best to book on their website as not all travel sites have access to their full inventory. The place is a very social & party headquarters, so this may not be the best selection for those expecting to get quality sleep every night. At check-in payment with credit card incurs a $1fee/night, so best to pay cash or use a debit card. There is a $20 key return deposit upon check-in. There are multiple bed rooms, so inquire for a room with fewer (4 vs 8) beds. Guests tend to be under 30 yrs. old. It is a non-smoking facility. **The reception is located on the second floor and there are no elevators. One thing that really impressed me was their info corner. This corner offered one of the best cheat sheets of TO DO/TO GO lists of any property I have ever stayed and this includes five star hotel properties. These little sheets, for example, listed FAQ’s, local foods, local coffee shops, local bars, a brewery list, and more. Each little sheet was pre-cut, so you could just grab it and go. The sheets listed hours for the businesses, clientele, mapped the area, favorite items to purchase at these businesses along with price categories. A simple idea, but excellent information source for all guests.Room:The rooms were probably a bit more dated, but still comfortable. The 4-bunk rooms were tight, but functional. Beds come with a reading light, power outlet, large storage area for each unit under the bunks. I was able to get my large suitcase under the bunk, just remember to bring your own lock. Linen is provided. I happen to be in a co-ed room.Amenities:Free Wi-Fi, free breakfast (07.30-10), pool tables/games, entertainment, lobby massage chairs, huge ball-room, computer lounge, laundry room, community kitchen and fridge storage, coffee/tea, and numerous free dinner nights in the community kitchen during the week. Check the activities board for numerous events each night of the week in-house and around the city. There is a sauna for guests by request only.Overall, the place is a bit more dated and the rooms can be cramped but the hostel certainly offers one of the best activity calendars of any of the SF hostels I have booked in the past. The staff is efficient and very friendly. More mature guests may want to take into account the youthful activities and events and may want to consider other hostels.","April 30, 2019","27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

Any questions you have just ask on front desk. Liked the idea of san Francisco landmarks and instructions to reach there. As a traveler you want to keep those info handy.Rooms are good with clean bed and sheets. Clean washrooms. Every evening new activity. Very nice ball room to hangout and eat. Pool table is an additional fun.Only drawback was kitchen utensils hygiene. Probably when I was there the washing area tap was not fixed properly. Utensils were all sticky even after wash. If you provide free food then can make sure utensils are neat and clean.

1533,"I stayed at Green Tortoise for four days. I chose a hostel as I was travelling solo after a long time and wanted people around me. As a working professional I also wanted a place where I could work or use the computer if I wanted to. Green Tortoise was the perfect choice. The staff, like 70% of the people who choose to stay there were quite young. And very friendly. As there is no elevator,they helped me carry my luggage up. Then about the rooms,the dorms have bunk beds and a washbasin too. The basin is quite useful as you can use it when the common washrooms-cum-showers are occupied. The rooms are fairly neat, but the overall infrastructure is a bit old. They have fun themes on different nights. You get free breakfast everyday and on some nights too. If you buy food, you can label and refrigerate in their fridge. Bottom shelves usually have free food you can eat anytime of the day. It can range from salads and meal boxes to leftover cooked the night before. Location wise too it's quite central and has Italian restaurants around. They let me pack free food in their boxes and take it when I had to rush for a tour. They also have massage chairs and a dry sauna room that you can use for free. I felt a little grown up for bunk beds and the very young vibe, but also happy I stayed here as it was hassle free and super friendly. Would surely stay again. They also have a discounted shuttle service to the airport.","February 13, 2019","27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

1537,"I've been here three times. Once in 2014, once in 2015, and once more in 2018. Good times were had each time. They really are delightful, very social and friendly, and very clean. People from all over the world stay here. They have many options for stays that include private rooms, dorms, triples, etc. They also do dinners every monday wednesday and friday that people are encouraged to help prepare and then everyone gets to enjoy regardless. I'm something of a picky eater, so I didn't have much of these dinners, but it's still a lovely way to get people to gather. Their cook, who gives speeches during the dinners, is quite a character. They are really nicely located, you can walk straight to the piers and the Exploratorium(which I love) pretty easily. Pier 39 and 41 are a distance away, though. Some good pizza is a few blocks away and there is a place that makes excellent wings that is close enough to deliver. Just all around excellent. They have some policies that are kind of annoying but also make sense, like not allowing food or drink in the rooms. Bathrooms are a bit packed in the mornings. Regardless, a beautiful place in a beautiful city. Recommend any day of the week. Five stars! ALL THE STARS. (I only give a four on service because of some less than ideal experience with the cleaning lady not coming back to clean our room when we said we'd be out in five minutes.

But in my opinion, what really makes or break your experience here is the people that you end up sharing a room with. There can be some sketchy individuals but it's not that bad overall. It's expected that you will have be adapt to the others in your room (people in and out, moving things around, snoring, etc.). It's probably best to bring earplugs. My belongs felt secure and safe as they have lockers under the bed. The area isn't bad either, it can be noisy outside - especially on the weekends but it's safe as there's usually lots of people hanging around. Buses are close by, and a lot of the tourist places are in walk-able distance (Fisherman's Wharf.

Highly recommend this place. I would definitely stay again!","August 8, 2018","27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

1556,"I stayed at the Green Tortoise a few years ago and had an awesome experience. I’ve since recommended it to lots of friends and family and they have all stayed. So when I had two nights in SF I straight away booked here again. We had a rough day and our two flights were delayed and we arrived at the hostel just after 2am (I had emailed the staff to let them know in advance) we arrived to the hostel and got our bags inside and my partner waited at the bottom of the stairs as I went to check in. As soon as I got to the top of the stairs I was yelled at by the receptionist “don’t kick our doors”....I was baffled and told her I hadn’t done anything to the door other then bump it with my large suitcase. Which she snapped back “you kicked it, I watched you!”. We were off to a great start and it only got worse. The receptionist VELL was rude, condescending, and incredibly unwelcoming. She snapped at me for asking her legitimate questions and gave sarcastic remarks. At this point my partner (who was down the bottom of the stairs) heard the way she was speaking to me and came up. He was also greeted with the same foul attitude. After snapping at us and taking my payment she said “room 36, go right, left, right” and threw the keys on the counter. No explanation of the facilities or perks this hostel offers. Then the following morning we were leaving early (5am) and the same staff member was sitting at the desk...scowling at us as we walked past, not so much as a smile or hello. We have been traveling all over the States and Canada for 12 weeks and this is the WORST customer service, hands down, we’ve ever encountered. Vell - you are in the wrong line of work and the Green Tortoise should be ashamed to have someone like that on their otherwise great & friendly team. We stayed in a private room, it’s was on the 3rd floor and was adequate. Bed was not the greatest but did the job. The bathrooms are great and they even offer shampoo/conditioner/soap. We didn’t eat at the breakfasts as our schedule didn’t allow but in my past stay it was great. Overall, the Hostel is cool & in a great location but our stay was completely ruined by the attitude of one staff member...and it ruined our time enough for us not to want to return.","July 28, 2018","27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

1557,"I stayed in a small room with my two teenagers, and we had a blast. Green Tortoise has an amazing location near everything we wanted to see, so it became not just our hostel but a base for operations. For example, we came over mid-day to have the free tea/ coffee they provided and rest. On our last day, they allowed us to store luggage after check-in. The staff at the hostel were all super-welcoming, and the gorgeous front-desk person Jo was gracious enough to listen and laugh to my teenager's jokes for about an hour in the evening. All the free food was a huge bonus--there are some free dinners, free breakfasts and etc. GT became a highlight of our vacation, and I would not hesitate to stay here again.

The hostel is nice, I was worried about it being promoted as a 'party hostel' but the rooms were quiet and there werent any loud groups that we noticed. The bathrooms are clean and nice, you may have to wait but i only had to wait about 10 minutes. The busy time is after 730am til about 830am. Breakfast was basic but filling and the dinner was good. Sometimes they have food brought in for you to have as well. The shuttle that they are partnered with is very reliable and quick! its 15 each way.

The hostel had a lovely atmosphere. There were shared bathrooms and shower rooms on each floor, all were very clean and I saw cleaners working around the building every day. The room wasn’t very big, especially considering it was for three travellers who would obviously have luggage. There also isn’t any elevator, which made bringing suitcases in and out a bit difficult. There was free breakfast every morning and free dinner three times a week. Also a lot of posters advertising social nights each night and trips the hostel staff could help you plan.

1561,"I have stayed in so many hostels in U.S. and other countries and this is the first one that I have unpleasant memories. My bedroom (shared, 4 beds) had a strong stuffy smell. Getting back to the hostel at night very tired, ready to sleep and smelling that was not good at all. Also it didn't feel easy to meet other travelers as the other hostels I have stayed. There were some armchairs in the computers area and also the big dining room, but I missed a ""cozy"" and welcoming room to simply hang out on the couch for example and meet people. I didn't feel that ""hostel vibe"" and it didn't feel like a ""party hostel"" as they promote themselves.Besides that, it was always tricky to open the bedroom door with that key (I have seen others having problems too). And I had just one backpack, but the hostel has many stairs so it is hard for travelers with many bags.Otherwise, good location, breakfast was ok, most of the times I could find a bathroom available, safe (room to store bags is locked, also there were cameras in the hostel and we had to show our room key when getting back to the hostel), and not all, but some staff members were friendly.","June 10, 2018","27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

As soon as we began the check in though we knew we had made the right decision. The staff are all warm and helpful, and we felt comfortable immediately. We had a private room in the annex building down the street, which was very comfortable with clean modern bathrooms, a clean and complete little kitchen, and a nice view of the city and bridge, especially at night, from the little patio space on the top floor. It was peaceful and quieter at night than a lot of hotels we have stayed in. The community area was great for hanging out and sharing meals, which were very good. We will definitely be back.

They are accomplished in the art of banter and laughed at my jokes---this always earns a couple of extra stars. The facility is clean and well maintained throughout, and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast is scheduled for 7:30, but coffee was ready much earlier. Thank you. The dining area is spacious which let guests spread out for quiet and privacy. There was also an assortment of old well used guitars to play before hitting the pavement. Also, very nice.The layout was simple for adequate to fuel up for a day of walking the city. Now, the North Beach location, a few steps away from the intersection of Kearny and Broadway is excellent as I like the neighborhood. My literary themed walk took me to City Lights Books and Cafe Trieste where I communed with the ghostly presence of Ginsberg, Kerouac, and the other beats.

1567,"I had booked a private room. For the price you pay for a centrally located hostel in comparison with normal hotels it is a okay deal.Very friendly and accomodating staff, had good tips of where to go and how to get there. They are interested in how you are and how your day was. The breakfast is limited for the price paid. Also the exact same breakfast is there every day, which isn't really special. And served a little late (07:30) in the morning. Early starters need to find breakfast elsewhere or make your own.The room I was in (29B), has a window facing the hallway. The curtains aren't thick enough to block that light from illuminating the room. That should be fixed, as rooms to sleep in should be really dark.Other than that the room was clean and the bed comfortabele with a locker box that holds a suitcase and a trolley underneath the bed. Showers are kept clean and provide enough water at a good hot temperature. And there was always one available for your needs.Other guests could consider sleeping guests a bit more, woke up at night when conversations were finished in the hallway.Other than those few points, I really had a nice stay and would consider them for a future visit.","April 18, 2018","27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

They had good breakfast options, with bagels (choice of spread- cheese/butter/peanut butter), juices, milk, eggs that you cook by yourself. One thing that I liked was that they already mentioned on their site about the noise that would be there at night from the street. Location of the hostel is perfect, very near to Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, Telegraph hill, etc.The only thing that was a concern(just on the very first day because I had not expected it) was that though the hostel was centrally located, the block it was on was full of strip clubs.

1583,"The Green Tortoise is largely a place for the younger folks, ones who are generally more agreeable to bunk room situations. I'm not, but the Green Tortoise does have about five single rooms in a separate building, just a couple of blocks from the main building. I chose one of those room. The bed was comfortable and the sharing the bath was not an issue.My room had two large windows that opened. I love that! With a double / queen bed in a room designed for something smaller, it was a little tough getting out of your own way, but I understand that putting in the larger bed probably makes more sense. There was a box fan in the room, but it was not needed. Just as well because it was filthy. I have little patience for neglected and very obvious maintenance items. The bath has a rod that holds three rolls of toilet paper. All were empty, and there was a separate roll on the windowsill. I had noticed the afternoon before that the rolls were empty. I think we can agree that's a big no-no. Check-in was easy and friendly. Since the room was in a separate building, someone walked me over to it. There was a (big sigh) tip jar on the check-in counter! No, no, no, i'm not going to tip you for checking me in! For a place like the Green Tortoise, who goes to lengths to be fun, the presence of a tip jar for checking you in is a mite pretentious. (If the place were the Hotel Costa Plenty, instead of the Green Tortoise, I'd be equally annoyed.) I was looking forward to the breakfast in the morning - the ""hostel feel"". Everyone had to cook their own breakfast. Maybe there were other items to cook, but all I saw were eggs. After cooking your breakfast, then you clean the dishes you just used. Even with just four or five people cooking or cleaning, it was literal case of ""too many cooks in the kitchen."" I found it terribly impractical and very poorly laid out. Even small considerations such as ""where is a cup for the coffee?"" was more challenging than it needed to be.","September 20, 2017","27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

1586,"I was a bit hesitant to book this place at first given the photographs of the property as it looked a bit dated. Typically we like to stay in a little higher end places but this just seemed to be a colossal waste of money given the price of hotel suites in San Francisco. With that being said, I was pleasantly surprised with the accommodations at the suites at fisherman‘s wharf. We were given a one bedroom unit on the first floor with a city view in fact right across from world famous restaurant Gary Danko (If we were on the 3rd floor we would be able to see the bay, but it seems that all of the units are obstructed views except the very top floor). There is a fabulous balcony area on the roof with great views over the bay. Our unit certainly did look dated but was clean and adequate for our needs. The location was truly amazing you are only One block from Ghirardelli Square and a short walk to the waterfront fisherman’s wharf area, and literally right on the cable car line.

1588,"Hubby and I decided San Francisco would be a wonderful place to celebrate our 35th anniversary. We had previously visited individually, but never together. We wanted to have a ""tourist"" experience.After a warm welcome from reception including a glass of champagne, we entered our home for the next four nights. Pleasantly surprised at the size. Unfortunately, no balcony, but we are on the quiet side away from the main street. The suite is nicely furnished and well stocked with kitchen necessities. The king bed is comfortable with plenty of pillows. Everything is impeccably clean. We can hear the occupants above us occasionally because the floor squeaks in places, but it's not intrusive. This speaks to the age of the building. Had they not been so considerate, there could have been a problem. The location is excellent. We had no problem walking to the piers and there is a cable stop just outside on the corner. There are plenty of amenities: self-serve laundry, filtered water, Friday night wine party, and the roof-top area has a million-dollar view. I read in some reviews that there were problems with staff. EVERYONE on the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to ensure our needs were met and exceeded. We had a fantastic stay and would definitely return.","June 30, 2019","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1589,"On a recent trip to San Francisco, we stayed at the Suites at Fisherman’s Wharf. It was an apartment type complex right in the heart of the city’s busiest and best area (Fisherman’s wharf) and it was such a perfect stay during our time here! From the moment we checked in we were treated very well by polite and helpful staff, also being spoiled with champagne! You have great facilities in the rooms to cater for your any needs, from cooking to relaxing, and if you want to enjoy the sun and the views, there is even a rooftop seating area where you can eat, drink, sunbathe and soak in the amazing views that San Fran has to offer, with a great 360 degree view from the bay bridge to the golden gate! Would definitely recommend the Suites at Fisherman’s wharf and if we come back to San Francisco we will be staying here again definitely! 5 stars! ","June 15, 2019","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1590,"I can reliably state that my second stay here after 7 years was identical to the first - suites were still impeccable, clean, well maintained and comfortable. Our 1 BR with a full kitchen and full sized fridge served 3 adults very well. The bathroom may be dated and small but adequate. Pullout queen sized bed and rollaway bed were OK - one cannot expect too much comfort vs the queen sized bed in the bedroom.Security box, full amenities in the bathroom, great complimentary WiFi, small balcony with chairs - add to the comfort. As mentioned in the past, noise from traffic and tourists may be bothersome when the windows and balcony doors are opened - as the weather was cool when we stayed both times, this was not much of an issue, However, this may be more challenging during the hotter periods as there is no air condition.Staff, as in the past, were consistently friendly, helpful and warm - this made our stay extra special!Location - a stroll to Fisherman's Wharf, great walks to the pier, and eateries galore.Suites at Fisherman's Wharf might be small, ""dated"", with no facilities (like gym etc), but the staff, comfort, security and great maintenance, pack a big punch.","June 5, 2019","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1593,"We stayed at the SF Suites for 4 nights at the beginning of our USA tour. The property was chosen on the basis of its location and the fact that, for the same price as a room-only basis hotel in the area, it had its own kitchenette. We were accommodated in room 101 on the 1st floor, a one bedroom apartment. Check-in was swift and everything in the apartment was clean, tidy and working which was what just we needed after a long flight. We did not hear too much noise as other reviewers have noted, it appears we were lucky that our fellow guests were a quiet, respectful bunch. There is no kettle, some pictures show a kettle that can be placed on the 2 ring stove plate but our apartment did not have one. Fortunately we had our travel kettle but at 110 volts it takes ages to boil! There is a coffee machine and a combi microwave oven as well as a toaster and a large fridge. The location of the SF Suites is good for access to Fishermans Wharf, Ghiradelli Square is a block away as is the Buena Vista Café. There is a posh restaurant across the street, many options in Ghiradelli Square and loads more cheaper options at the Wharf itself. 5 blocks away is a Safeway supermarket where we stocked up on breakfast items. 1 block away is the start of the Hyde-Powell cable car line – best to get on here. You can get right into the centre of SF on this line. All in all good value for money given the hotel prices in the area especially given that you can make our own meals.","May 21, 2019","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1595,"This is a hard place to review because it has both strengths and weaknesses. The location is really fun and it is great to have a one bedroom apartment with a reasonably functional kitchen. The rooftop patio has wonderful views and is a cool place to hang out.On the other hand, the unit itself is pretty dated and uninspired. Some rooms have balconies, but they overlook a busy street. The units in back are quieter, but pretty dark.A All of the bedrooms back onto the central atrium and are dark and windowless (other than a high window onto he atrium.) We had quite a bit of noise from the unit above us. I don't regret going as we had a lot of fun playing tourist in SF, but I doubt I would return.Oh, and don't fall for the pitch from the ""concierge"" to do the ""free breakfast.""

1597,"The Suites at Fisherman's Wharf is in a great location for exploring San Francisco. It is on the corner of Hyde St and North Point St. It is 2 blocks to Ghiradelli Square and a walkable distance to Fisherman's Wharf. There is a cable car stop and bus stop right by the building. We used the on site parking for $22 per day with in and out privileges. Compared to other hotels I looked into when booking this trip, the parking is a steal! The parking area is little so parking a big truck or SUV could be tricky. The room was good. It was clean and had a spacious living room with a pull out bed. The room decorating was a bit dated. The bathroom looked to be freshly remodeled. A downside was the lack of bathroom fan. The room was very humid and steamy after showering. Above the shower was a small window to the hallway. Opening the window helped with the steam but if you were sitting on the toilet with the window open, the people walking on the floor above could potentially look right at you! Needless to say, we rarely had the window open. The other downside is that at times, we could easily hear our upstairs neighbors. The day we arrived we planned on going to sleep early but the room above was still awake. We could hear them walking around and the children talking. There is a roof top patio with a few tables with a great view. Overall, a comfortable place to stay. It is an excellent location at a reasonable price.

The rooms are spacious and well appointed. All was clean, in order and well serviced. It’s nice to have the cooking facilities should they be wanted. Service at the front desk was courteous and helpful. The only reason to score a 4 and not a 5 was the noise that was transmitted from the room above.

1600,"I stayed there with my wife and 2 children (2 & 5) in late October for 9 days, and we found it very well suited to our needs. It really is a great location, right where you need to be so any travelling to see attractions, though necessary in a large city, is minimized.What I really liked about the rooms was the space. There was a large lounge and bedroom, and although the bathroom and kitchen were smaller, they were just fine for our needs. The staff were also very helpful, and anything we asked for was quickly attended to.There were two large televisions (lounge and bedroom) with plenty of channels, and a large fridge/freezer. The view across the Bay to Alcatraz from the balcony was a nice extra feature.If I had a moan, I would say that the decor was somewhat dated and a little old, and the kitchen could do with an update in terms of the units weren't of the best quality. But I would emphasize that this in no way impacted on the quality of our stay.It isn't the upmarket, modern,type of place you would get at a large modern hotel chain, but it is a well located, spacious, and enjoyable space to stay . I read some negative reviews claiming that the 'heavy doors to the lift were a fire hazard', and I really have no idea what that was talking about, these criticisms are absolute rubbish in every way.This place deserves the high rating it currently enjoys.","November 7, 2018","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1602,"The Suites at Fisherman’s Wharf is at the corner of Hyde and North Point. The cable cars run along Hyde and the buses, along North Point. Thus making it an ideal location, transportation wise. It is also a short distance from Ghirardelli Square. Although the cable car stops right in front of the hotel, it is best to take it from the terminus, a short distance downhill, if you need a seat. You can also get your tickets/passes at the terminus. This hotel has one or two bedrooms, mainly one-bedroom. Parking is self parking and cost $25/day. Self laundry costs $1.50 per load. There is a lookout patio on the 4th floor where one can see Alcatraz and the surrounding area. Hyde St Pier is within walking distance. This hotel is not very big but the staff is nice and friendly.

1604,"Overall, it's a pleasant hotel. I enjoyed my stay. I felt the hotel staff was pleasant and accommodating. The location is fabulous. The only downsides were the late checkin (4:00 is quite late) and the elevator not staying on the floor if you didn't enter right away. One may wonder why this is an issue. The elevator door doesn't open. It's an old-fashioned elevator, where you need to open the door. So, if you are distracted at all and don't see the elevator coming, through the small window, you might miss it. It immediately goes back to the main floor. I think they should get rid of the outer doors so one can see when the elevator comes or, if they can, change the elevator behavior so it waits until someone else calls it. For one or two nights, the elevator is charming, but for a longer stay, it becomes annoying.Regarding the late checkin, I feel 4:00 is quite late as a checkin time and they were not at all accommodating about an earlier checking, even if informed ahead of time that I was coming and needed access to the refrigerator. They also did not have my allergies noted in the record, despite having been called a week beforehand to have them noted.So, 4 stars is appropriate. The overall experience was excellent, but they do have room for improvement.","September 3, 2018","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1605,This location is situated two blocks north of the bay. It is within easy walking distance to all of the Wharf activities and transportation. The resort itself is the problem. Actions in rooms above the room can be heard thru the ceilings. Shower activities can be heard thru a false window into a common area. Queen sofa bed mattresses are too thin. There is a heavy door covering the elevator door which presents a fire escape hazard. Parking is limited and too close to park comfortably. Fee charged to park is ridiculous.

Otherwise it's another corner on to the start of the Fisherman's Wharf boardwalk, with as many bars, cafe's, gift & tourist shops and restaurants that you could hope to fit in on your holidays without duplicating at any time.It has a rooftop sitting area as well, so you can take advantage of the views out across the bay on most nights.Any of the staff that we came into contact with were extremely helpful.

The cable car runs up and down Hyde so if you’re a light sleeper you might have trouble with that.","March 4, 2018","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1621,"Stayed here 3 nights as a married couple and 18-yr old son in a 1-bed suite at rear ground level 1 (no views) with pullout queen sofa bed in living area. The big pluses were the great location and spaciousness of the apartment. Ours was also quiet both from internal atrium and outside street noise. The negatives were its slightly dated decor and appliances and the lack of light in the rooms. All bedrooms and bathrooms here seem to open into an inner atrium, so have no natural light ... and the atrium could do with a bit more ventilation. If you can't get a room with a view along the front (North Pt) or side (Hyde St) you may be in for a dim time. Having access to the roof terrace would help, but unfortunately this was not available for us in February due to renovations on the terrace. Check what sort of room you are getting and where it is before booking as the difference between being at the back and low down versus the front and higher up is significant if you care about views and light. Also ck whether the roof terrace is operating.","February 8, 2018","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

All the bedrooms face this communal living room, so when guests decide to avail themselves of additional space at 2 am speaking loudly on the speaker phone, or when they decide to use the computer to play games, it will be right outside your window. Also when guests slam doors at 6:30 am on Christmas Day when they go from room to room, it can be frustrating.We had the room 103 on the first floor and it was right next to the computer, which was used frequently by guests during our stay.

City noise and lights carry into the rooms. The rooms are clean however housekeeping did not come very often or at all-can't recall. We had to call for more shampoo, towels and toilet paper. If parking on site, be aware that the garage it very tiny, allowing about 10 cars if not less. We drove in with a full size SUV and had a rough time. The hotel had nice touches, coffee, fresh fruit and cucumber water in the lobby. Once a week they hold a guest social hour with complimentary wine and appetizers.

1628,"As a couple and an unrelated adult, we thought our suite #105 would have some separation for sleeping, however, the pull out coach in the living room was disturbed by the noisy refrigerator and upstairs guests loudly talking and playing their tv until after 2 a.m. Insulation for noise control is very poor. Our bedroom window opened onto a central atrium where people were going and coming throughout the night talking loudly and slamming doors. On the other hand, the kitchenette was quite nicely appointed with dishes, silverware, microwave etc. There were even 6 wine glasses and a dishwasher. The location is terrific, only 2 blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square. Our room also had its own outdoor patio with a table and chairs. Obviously we thought we were getting a 2 bedroom suite. The view from the rooftop patio, which is shielded from the wind was terrific. We took wine and cheese up our first night and really enjoyed it. Not Sure why Sunday night was $200 more than Saturday.","October 1, 2017","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

The view from the roof is so much better than the pictures and is the perfect spot to enjoy a quiet drink at the end of each day. Whilst in SF don't miss biking across the bridge to Sausilito - get your bikes from Blazing Saddles just down the road, these people know how to do customer service!All in all, I wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else.

The staff is super nice, not only the front desk but the maids and the guys who move the cars around and do maintenance, etc. There are lots of restaurants nearby and the cable car and the 30 Stockton bus or the F train will get you a lot of places quickly. A 3 day Muni pass is $32 and includes the cable car. The rooftop deck is amazing with its panoramic view of the bay. The garage isn't big enough but they do the best they can moving cars around.

1634,"I booked a one-night stay for me, my wife, and our 17-year old daughter. The facility is hard to find and does not look at all like a hotel from the street (which is not a big deal; just worth a mention). When I went to check in, I was greeted by Jason at the front desk, who confirmed my reservation, took credit card details for incidentals, and gave me the card keys for the room. After taking the tiny elevator (for those who are at all claustrophobic), we entered our room to find it was a one-bedroom suite instead of the two-bedroom suite we had booked and prepaid. I immediately went down to the front desk and spoke with Jason, and showed him the itinerary confirming we had booked and paid for a two-bedroom suite. Jason said ""oh, you booked through Expedia,"" and then said that Expedia describes the room we were given as a ""two-bedroom suite"" because the sofa folds out into a queen-size bed and there is a separate bedroom. Although I was fairly certain that Jason was lying, it was late, we were tired, and my wife and daughter said not to make a big deal of it. After we returned home, I verified that there are indeed two-bedroom suites as well as one-bedroom suites, and there is a significant price difference of sixty bucks per night between the two. I immediately wrote to both Expedia and the hotel group, but over seven months later have not received a refund.","August 4, 2017","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

Restaurants a short walk away and a good selection too. 20 minutes stroll to the Italian area.It also has a good roof terrace looking out towards Alcatraz and harbour. Couple of down sides. One, the walls aren't that well insulated so hearing noisy neighbours with less consideration than others could be an issue. Two, the pull out sofa bed needs replacing. It's knackered and broken.

The lift is very small and doors are awkward to operate if you have larger luggage. The sofa bed is horribly uncomfortable for an adult. But my main complaint is the ludicrous check in time of 4pm. I don't want to spend hours on the road to arrive at the hotel to be told to go for a walk, I want to settle in and relax. The explanation was that they are a small hotel so it's hard to get all the rooms prepped. Here's a suggestion for the management genius running the place, employ more staff! Don't give me a boring story about getting things perfect, it's not the Ritz for heaven's sake.

At check-out, I reviewed my stay and the issues encountered, but no adjustment could be made. When I inquired several days later, I was told that all complaints had to be brought forward during the visit, and nothing could be done afterwards.

1647,"GENERALWe been to San Francisco many times, as it is one of our favorite cities, so stayed 7-nights over spring break with family, in a 2-bedroom timeshare condo exchanged through Interval International. LOCATION and PUBLIC TRANSPORTATIONThe condo is in the perfect location, one block from Ghirardelli Square. About a 5-minute walk to the Wharf area and 10-minute walk to Pier 39. Public transportation is so convenient—the Powell-Hyde cable car and MUNI buses both have stops literally right outside the front door! Grocery store (Safeway and Trader Joes) are 5 blocks away. Get yourself a MUNI pass (1, 3, 7 day) which will let you get around the city; note it does not cover BART, which is the train to/from SFO. We picked up our 7-day pass ($42 each) at information booth in baggage claim. Don’t forget to also pick up a $3 MUNI map with bus/cable car routes.PARKINGWe rented a car so we could visit family in Sacramento and took a couple of other day trips during our stay. There is limited parking (about 15 spots for 25 condos). Parking is $22 a day. If you are lucky (like us), once you get your spot, you have it the rest of your stay. If not, supposedly you can park in a nearby (more expensive) public lot temporarily until a spot opens later during your stay. If are not planning to leave the city, DON’T bother with a car; you’ll just pay a lot for parking.LIKES* Renovated, good-size condo, especially for SF. Very clean.* Beds: 1 king-size, 1 queen-size, large sofa bed. * Roof-top terrace with gorgeous unobstructed view of the bay and Alcatraz* 2 washers & dryers near lobby ($1.50 each), though 1 dryer was broken* Large in-room safe* Kitchen: 2-burner, fridge, toaster, microwave, blender, dishwasher, dishes and utensilsNEUTRAL* Older building so doors, cabinet and floors creaked* Small, simple lobby. Small business center (computer, printer)* No traditional oven—microwave is also a convection oven* No A/C, although did not need it in April* Minor sales pitch for their timeshare, which we declined with no further pressureDISLIKES* Quite noisy (NOT condo’s fault) because you are next to cable line!* Quite dark in living room* Beds not very comfortable* Bath tub clogged; told front desk but was not fixed* Large master bedroom closet but none in 2nd bedroom and no drawers for clothes* Free Wi-Fi very slow (<1 Mps). Can pay for faster Wi-Fi ($50 for the week) SUMMARYCan’t beat location especially with a large accommodation","April 22, 2017","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

We had no view from our room, but the hotel has a lovely roof deck with nice views of the water and Alcatraz. The hotel is conveniently located near Fisherman's Wharf. We walked a lot and took conveniently located busses, and the Trolly is only a block away. We will definitely stay at this hotel again if we are fortunate enough to have a chance to return to San Francisco. ","March 10, 2017","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1653,"I was attending a conference at the Moscone and all the downtown hotels were booked so I found this place, which turned out to be perfect. It's literally on the cable car line and 100 yards from the Fisherman's Wharf turnaround on Hyde St. I bought a 3-day pass and rode the cable cars back and forth each day. The Suites at Fisherman's Wharf is a small (24 rooms) modern place where the rooms are built around a central atrium. There's a rooftop deck that gives you views of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. Plus my suite had a balcony and chairs facing the Bay. The suite was amazing in terms of the square footage for San Francisco. Big bedroom, separate spacious living room with wraparound couch and table. Full kitchen. You're a stone's throw from Fisherman's Wharf, which is touristy, but does have some interesting restaurants, especially ones overlooking the water. In the other direction, you can walk to Fort Mason, which a scenic area. Couple of other points: 1. No breakfast is served. 2. This is apparently a condo/time share type of thing owned by Wyndham, so I got a sales pitch type of call, but not high pressure. 3. It's not really a hotel in terms of amenities, gift shop, soda machines, etc. But you're in the heart of SF, so it's all good. I would definitely return to the Suites. Oh, and the Internet wasn't the fastest.","February 21, 2017","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

It is well situated being only a blcok from Fisherman's Wharf and the tram passes right by the hotel. It is well appointed and clean but things are alittle dated. However, the quality of the stay, the friendliness of the staff, and location definitely made up for the slightly dated look.

1657,"The location of this little gem is terrific. Three blocks from the Wharf which has something for everyone (check out the Gold Dust for adults, the Raintree Cafe for the kids (pricey but one of a kind), and the lighted boats at Christmas time.) The famed (for it's Irish coffees) Buena Vista or the BV as locals call it is two blocks from the hotel, and two blocks in another direction is the Ghiradelli Square, famous for chocolates and ice cream. Everything within walking distance without the crowds and traffic. You just feel like you are walking down any street in a City neighborhood. Want to go downtown? The cable car stops right in front of the hotel! The hotel itself is small, not fancy but clean, quiet and serene. There is only one small elevator and no bell service, so keep that in mind when packing. Of course the ""crown jewel"" is the sun deck on top of the hotel which, on a clear day or night, gives you a partial few of the Bay Bridge in one direction and the Golden Gate Bridge in another! The only complaint was the garage is first come, first serve and needs to be up-dated for newer models of cars.","January 7, 2017","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

The location is perfect for an intimate cocktail party prior to walking to a restaurant--either at Fisherman's Wharf, the Cannery or even North Beach! Each time my appreciation of the area is renewed. You have a choice of a view or a garden, near the clanging sounds of the cable car or a more isolated room for a quieter stay. The only negatives are (1) Parking (ground floor parking space is limited and first come-first served) and (2) No breakfast served (but your basically stocked kitchen provides the essential tools for any general cooking desires). This may well become your go-to place for a relaxing and memorable stay in The City By the Bay.","December 7, 2016","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1662,"We have stayed here many times and enjoyed our stays. My wife and I had made reservations to spend the Thanksgiving week here in February. This was to be a special trip because my cousin and his wife just had their first child and this would have been our first Thanksgiving with the new member of our family as well the first time my wife, mother, my cousins mom, and I would have got to meet him. Today my wife and I called to confirm our reservations as we always due and we were told that we in fact did NOT have a reservation and that the establishment was filled and there was nothing they would be able to do for us for that week. As I pressed the woman I was speaking with she asked if I had the email with the reservation on it, unfortunately I was unable to find the email because it had been deleted. Her reply was if I had no email conformation then I had not made a reservation (essentially calling me a liar) and there was nothing she could or would do for us. Basically, thanks to an error on their side I now have plane tickets, food being sent specifically for our Thanksgiving dinner, my cousins expecting us and no where to stay. Needless to say this has been a very disappointing experience because up until now we loved our little place and now it will be forever tainted.","October 5, 2016","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

The bed was extremely comfortable and the kitchen amenities were great. The roof terrace was fantastic and looked over the bay with a clear view of Alcatraz and Golden Gate bridge in the distance. The apartments were in a great location and the area felt safe. Ghirardelli square is close by and we bought ice-cream and ate it on the roof terrace, which was lovely. The cable car also stops right outside the hotel which is handy if you use it to get around. However all the attractions at Fishermans Wharf are in walking distance and we walked to other tourist attractions too such as Lombard Street, Coit Tower and the Alcatraz Ferry. We loved San Francisco and would definitely recommend the Suites to people visiting.","September 10, 2016","28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1668,"Our family of 4 stayed in a one-bedroom suite for 9 nights of vacation. We were very happy with our choice overall. We have two boys (15 and 11) and wanted enough space. We typically stay at Hilton type hotels on vacation for that reason. Hotels are so expensive here that we were priced out of suites or taking 2 rooms. We looked at VRBO, but didn't find any in as good a location as The Suites at Fisherman's Wharf. Plus it's nice to have the reassurance of 24 hr front desk for any problems and cleaning, etc.Loved that we were close to wharf activities without being in the center of tacky souvenir shops and all the noise. You are 1 block into the neighborhood of Russian Hill which feels less touristy. Buses and Cable car right on hotel corner. The stop for The street car to wharf and ferry building is a 5-10 minute walk.Loved our balcony and the roof top deck to enjoy a bottle of wine and the incredible views! So great to enjoy the San Francisco air and vibe and not be in a tiny sealed hotel room. Also loved having coin operated laundry downstairs, so we didn't have to overpack or waste money on cleaning service.Areas of improvement? Well my kids were bummed there was no pool, but we knew that going in. The rollaway bed wasn't available until our 2nd night. The pull out and rollaway weren't the best, but with smaller kids it would be fine.The housekeeping was appreciated, but minimal. I.e never changed pull-out sheets, changed our bed once, but always had fresh towels and was tidy.The staff was eager to please and helpful with suggestions.I recommend it!

1670,"Stayed here with young kids. Location is perfect. Just a short walking distance from Wharf and bus/trolleys just outside the front door. Kitchen was fully stocked with necessities. Kids enjoyed the ""old fashioned"" elevator. The place is older and appears to have been painted over many times (interior door frames, etc). Our room was clean but outdated and appeared so. Stayed on upper floor so did not have any ""thin wall"" noise issues. Being we had a great view of the bay, and transportation stop is right outside, we did hear the busses and cars traveling all night but got used to the noise. Had room vacuumed and trash emptied upon request, as well as more towels, soaps refilled, etc. My only complaint is the odor. I could not get used to the old, wet wood, musty odor. It just smells old. My family wasn't as bothered by it as I was although it has bothered me enough to rethink my stay here again. It is clean, and plenty spacious, just smelly.

The free breakfast (early AM, ends at 9:30am) and round-the-clock coffee in the dining area (2nd flr, by the gym where you can refill your free water bottle at the water cooler) was awesome! Typical continental breakfast including pre-made omelettes, sausages, cereals, various milks, yogurts and fruits. Also, complimentary fruit infused water available in the lobby's snack shop.Clean guestroom and the use of space was smart; the bathroom is pretty big actually! We were out all Sat at Union Sq and Dolo -- we really love this location, so central for most of what we visited! The hotel is surrounded by hotels, eateries including several boba and other Asian delectables, and the brand name stores of Union Sq. We even got to leave our luggage with the front desk when we checked out early as we had an all-day wineries tour departing from Gray Line (Post St.) -- less than 10min walk to get there.We highly recommend this place.","July 10, 2019","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1676,"This is far and away the best Holiday Inn Express that I've stayed in. Modern rooms that are spacious given the city centre locale. Super staff all around, from the friendly front desk to housekeeping, who keep the place spotlessly clean. The location couldn't be better. Two blocks from Union Square, the Cable Car, and the Powell Street station, making it easy to reach from SFO using BART. All sorts of restaurants, bars and cafes in the immediate area, and you can walk to Chinatown and North Beach in 15-20 minutes for delicious food.Sadly I have to take off a star on this review for the appalling amount of waste that is generated in the breakfast room. Especially the plastic cutlery and non-recyclable cups. Yes, they offer paper plates, but those will also end up in a landfill.

1686,"My stay at HIE Union Square was for four nights. I had a conference to attend at the Moscone center and the location of the hotel was a good advantage. They are very close to everything imaginable for a traveler. Their staff is also very cooperative and supportive. However, the negatives are the extremely small, rat hole sized rooms and the disturbance from the street. There's a bar adjacent and you can't cut out that noise. They should have invested on sound proofing the room.","January 22, 2019","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1688,"To begin, the positives: The entire staff (front desk, bell desk, and Fast Start breakfast area) were extremely helpful and very pleasant. Although our room was not going to be ready early due to a late checkout request by the prior guest, the front desk stored (then placed in our room) all of our luggage stowed behind the desk. When I called down for extra towels (more on that later) and a TV remote, the staff providing everything promptly and with a smile.Now, the negatives: The front desk never asked about a vehicle. Are you going to charge me the daily parking fee regardless? There is no guidance for guests who have even have a vehicle. Is there a valet? Do we self park? Did they assume we took a Lyft/Uber/taxi to the hotel? Secondly, the room was extremely dusty. I wondered if it had been vacuumed recently it was so bad. Lastly, I provided and confirmed my Stay Preferences in advance. With four adults listed on the reservation and as requested in my Stay Preferences, there should be four, full sets of towels. There was an odd number of each: (3) bath towels; (4) hand towels; and (2) washcloths; thus, forcing me to call and wait for additional to be brought to the room. A TV remote was also lacking (but was brought up by request later.)The negatives are relatively minor. The location makes up for a lot. However, even as a HIE, you will pay a premium for the proximity to Union Square.I'd come back and stay.","January 3, 2019","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1691,"I find that the Downtown or Central City Expresses are always very well located and this one is certainly that. Just a block from Union Square it s near all the main transport hubs. Check-in was efficient and help was given with my somewhat excess luggage. Sweetly, the receptionist rang to see if I had settled-in OK. The room was modern and spotlessly clean. While the breakfast room was small, it was never overcrowded and the fare was good with a reasonable cross-section on offer. San Francisco is probably one of the most expensive cities in the USA and it is a popular conference venue. In common with hotels worldwide, this chain increases its room rates when demand in high. On the Sunday night my rate went up to GBP465 - a high rate for a three *** hotel. I decided to stay all the same - but I spent the next five nights at an out of town hotel. I would return, but not at any price. In the 2nd week of January 2019 the rate is already $900 a night excluding taxes.","November 17, 2018","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1692,"I checked in very late at around 10:30 pm and stayed 2 nights. Already upon check-in I requested a late check-out at 3:00 pm, because I am an IHG.com gold customer and therefore have the privilege to benefit from a late check-out. In fact that was the reason I booked an IHG.com hotel. The receptionist told me very firmly that check-out was at 11:00 am. I reminded him, that I was a gold member; but no mercy, except he could grant a late check-out at 1:00 p.m. Arrived in my room, which had no safe. All cups and mugs were made of plastic. Also the breakfast restaurant had plastic mugs as well as plastic cutlery. Ironically, the hotel reminds guests, that it cares about the environment and therefore recommends guests to use towels and linens again, in order to save detergent and the environment. What an irony.My bed was extremely soft, indeed too soft and no good for my back. I did not sleep that night for this reason. The following morning I informed the receptionist, this time a young woman, about the extremely soft bed. She told me, that I could change the room, but said that probably all beds are the same. (I hastened to add, that later that day housekeeping left extra blankets and a duvet in order for me to sleep on the floor). I slept well the following night. I took the opportunity to ask the receptionist, if she could extend my late check-out until 3:00 pm. She could not, although she granted a late check-out at 2:00 pm. Ironically, after my first night, the room was not cleaned until after 3:30 pm (I left my shopping bags in my room at 3:30 pm, at which time my room was not cleaned). I am concerned, that this hotel does not care about the environment, because it uses plastic mugs as well as plastic cutlery throughout the hotel.

We stayed because prices were up 2-3x normal because of another conference. When I complained they offered an “upgrade” to a suite. Well the room was a suite - right over the Irish pub. Loud thumping music until 2am every night. It was impossible to sleep. The whole room vibrates with the loud music. For $400 a night, I should have been told about the loud music and given an option.

There is a pub nearby that can be a little loud but only a minor amount of noise penetrated into the room. For some reason, they don’t get around to cleaning the rooms until late - twice during the week I returned to the room between 3-4pm and the room wasn’t cleaned yet. Breakfast is simple but worked perfectly fine for me as I like yogurt, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal and coffee which were all available. The location is perfect - right near the Powell cable car, union square and lots of shops and restaurants.

Then the last thing I want to mention is Susan from the front desk. She greeted me when I came early at 7am after 15 hour flight. She was emphatic and welcoming. She helped me feel that she hear me and promised to call when the room will be ready which she did later and I knew I can trust her. She and other staff members continued to greet everyone when we passed by the entrance. They simply raised the head and made a verbal or eye contact acknowledging the presence. Susan energy was viable, as opposed to some hotels where there is attitude Susan gave great service at eye level! If I need to visit again I would consider staying there. Prices were good.

1697,"We arrived into San Francisco airport and the BART took us directly to the area (only a couple of blocks to walk). At the exit from the BART was the information office and they were very helpful. The hotel is not well marked and it would be easy to miss, but once inside we had everything we really needed. We would have appreciated a small fridge and an in-room safe. We were able to lock up our valuables at the front desk, but it made us slightly uncomfortable. Breakfast was good and the room was clean and comfortable. We were very impressed with the staff. The location had both positives and negatives. On the plus side, it was easy to access the cable cars and MUNI bus system and thereby travel anywhere in the city. We bought a 7 day MUNI pass and it paid for itself within the first 2 or 3 days. There were lots of shopping and restaurant options in the vicinity. On the negative side, this hotel is located only 2 blocks from the Tenderloin and the area was inundated with people on the sidewalks begging. The streets were soiled with urine and the air was foul each morning. We saw city workers out sanitizing, but it is a huge job. We were warned not to walk west from the hotel at any time of the day. Mental health issues, drug use and homelessness were evident. Look carefully at the map and decide upon your comfort level with the location. We appreciated the nearby Walgreen store and made good use of their snacks and deli selections. There is lots to see in San Francisco and this is a central location.","September 9, 2018","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1698,"We (couple) stayed at this hotel for a week. Some of the positives were that breakfast was included, the price was better than many other hotels in the city (especially in relation to hotel ranking), the location was good for public transportation (a bus or trolley (or cab) can be easily accessed), it's a good area for shopping and eating (we really enjoyed the Asian restaurant next door), the staff were friendly, the wifi was good, the bathroom/shower was nice, and the bed was comfy. A few minor things that we'd consider cons were the small size of the room (not major as you should be out exploring and not hanging in the room), also we didn't have a fridge in our room which we thought was odd, and some outside (we were on a lower floor) and between room noise. The gym is small, but they do have one. Breakfast isn't elaborate but it's adequate with some hot food like eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, pancakes and cold food such as yogurt. There's also pastries, juice, coffee, cereal, toast, bananas, apples, etc. There's a Walgreens around the corner which was really helpful as we saved a lot of money grabbing drinks and snacks there; we even grabbed lunch there several times which left more money for nice dinners. Overall it was a good stay, and we'd stay here again.","August 30, 2018","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1700,"From our title, the biggest beef we had with this hotel was it doesn’t offer any laundry service which was a bit of a problem for us as we were traveling from an international location and had limited time available. We ended up finding an online laundry service that would pick up and deliver to the hotel, I would’ve thought the hotel could do a deal with a laundry service like that to fill that gap. The hotel is in a great location near Union Square which makes for easy restaurant selection as there are many nearby. We had the King Suite as my wife and I were traveling with our 2 teenage boys, the room was a little tight for all of us and our luggage but the reality was we didn’t spend a lot of time in the room anyway. I’d recommend this hotel if you don’t need all of the extras like room service etc. The hotel does offer breakfast which includes the usual basic offerings, better than spending big bucks for a bowl of cereal at a full service hotel.","August 21, 2018","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

Breakfast was the typical for a hotel that offers free continental breakfast. It did the trick. The room was very clear, but I thought the shower floor could have used some extra cleaning. The grout looked a bit dirty. The hotel is in a pretty decent location close to Union Square. If you don’t mind walking, then it’s a nice walk to different neighborhoods. Beware that it’s close to the sketchy neighborhood, but you shouldn’t be bothered unless you specifically walk through the Tenderloin neighborhood to the west.

1719,"The hotel was clean and conveniently located, but other than those qualities, there is little else to be said good about this hotel. After booking 7 nights, but not prepaid, we requested to leave 2 nights early, we were told we had to lose a full nights stay in order to do so. After complaining of the unfairness, we were then told we had to pay a $100 early departure fee which was never communicated verbally nor in hotel reservation confirmation. After calling to IHG to get support, hotel management then agreed to waive the early departure fee. In addition the hotel is in a very noisy area and sits atop an Irish pub that is extremely loud to the point of disrupting Sleep nightly, but especially on Saturday nights when the music plays to 2 am. After complaining to hotel management about excessive noise, their solution was to offer ear plugs to sleep in. We requested a partial refund for the night we wereunable to sleep and the hotel management refused. When we complained, the General Manager was not on property but said he would respond within 48 hours. We needed an immediate response, not a delay of 48 hours, as were would check out with 24 hours.Again, it was necessary to contact IHG to receive their assistancein resolving this matter, they had a case manager assigned that was very helpful in resolving this matter for us.

Breakfast was well done and the usual Holiday Inn Express fare.We could enjoy the evening walking around the square....the Irish Pub next door was a bonus. We also walked to the Embarcadaro, Fisherman's Wharf, the market through the Financial District and Chinatown. Allowed us to drop our luggage early in the morning so we could begin our tour immediately.One thing: noise is a problem and you need to be aware that there is music and alleyway noise until the wee hours of the morning.

Clean. Pleasant, efficient staff. Breakfast in a small 2nd floor dining room, where coffee is available self-serve all day. Room 312 had a window that opened (!) onto a side street that wasn’t noisy. I wouldn’t want to be in the front, room numbers ending in 01-05, because O’Farrell St can be noisy. We feared that the hotel’s having only 1 elevator might cause a “traffic jam” but it didn’t.

1735,"In the build up to stopping in San Francisco I did what most responsible travellers would do to get the most out of their holiday, research research more research then spend days checking for price alterations. After an exhaustive search I ended up selecting the holiday inn express, union square and I haven’t looked back, I now wander around San Fran marvelling at my choice looking at the tacky looking 3 and 4 star hotels most of which costs at least 50% more, San Fran is a really expensive place. The hotel is located around 2/3 mins from Union square. The rooms are clean, well maintained and serviced, the shower is quite large and no mound in the grout. Staff are also very pleasant. Breakfast is included and this is really useful if you are looking to save on costs, it is undersold on their website and actually includes a really good variety for which you can get a good fill that will last until mid afternoon. You can also usually pop back into the breakfast room to get a coffee or tea at any point during the day (not evenings or night).Room tip:Get at least the third floor as on certain days you can hear music from downstairs however, it isn’t on until late and you should be out enjoying the cityBooking tip:Register with TopCashback then book through hotels.com.

1737,"It was our first visit to San Francisco so I had not really a clue what hotel in which area to book. After a research on the internet my partner and me decided union square would be a good location to go for. I've never stayed at holiday inns but visited once for a meeting as I'm from the hotel trade and was pleasantly surprised. So I went ahead and booked it but still didn't expect as much as basics. When we arrived we've been warmly welcomed by reception staff and checked in. Hotel staff realised we were exhausted from our flight so they made it quick and sufficient. We've booked a basic room but were surprised of the high quality standard and cleanliness. After a little wander through town we were welcomed back and went to our room. After a good night sleep (very comfy bed) we headed down for breakfast and again were surprised with plenty of choice. From hot buffet items like scrambled egg and bacon to cereals and a fridge filled with yoghurts and fresh milk there was everything you needed to have a good start of your day. Very helpful reception staff which always went the extra mile and helped where they could. Every time we enter the hotel we were greeted and welcomed back. Sorry didn't get your names but you were brilliant. Would I recommend it? Definitely! If you want a hotel room which is not too expensive and you are only there for breakfast and want to discover town, this is the right place for you. They even have a basic gym which we didn't use. Keep it up guys. You're doing a great job.","October 16, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1738,"I was recently forced to modify my 3-night hotel booking twice due to flight cancellations (climate conditions), and this change resulted in a rate increase of over USD300 total from my initial reservation and the new one. I contacted the manager and told him I fully understood how room rates fluctuated on a daily basis, however, given this particular situation, where niether party had control over weather factors, I kindly suggested him to consider a middle point where I would be charged 50% of the rate increase so niether the hotel nor myself would be totally affected by what had happened. It´s worth mentioning I also told him the rate I had originally booked, was a non refundable one,and that I felt frustrated to have to assume the 100% rate increase when it was not a change I personally requested, but rather forced to do so.His blunt answer was the hotel could not honor the rate adjustment due to conventions in the area during that week. With this answer, he completely disregarded my situation, and missed the opportunity to actually demostrate real customer care. In the end, it felt like the hotel took adavantage of the situation since I did not have another accommodation option to look for, but rather accept the rate increase or loose all my money. I didn´t let this ruin my stay (the rest of the staff was very cordial and professional), but it will definitely be my last one at a Holiday Inn chain hotel.","September 26, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

A short walk will get you to some very nice shopping. There is a ton of construction in this area which limits mobility a bit but hey when is there not construction in San Francisco?!? The only thing keeping a 5 rating is that for the last two nights of our stay they didn’t provide any wash cloths with rest of the linens. Not sure why and no explanation provided.

1741,"I gave this a one star rating because the two reception staff actually earned it.We looked online for a reasonable 24 Hour stay between flights in transit from USA for our Australian return. We were two women travelling alone, and after confronting issues after Hurricane Irma, we had our travel plans turned into disarray.We did not have a lot of time to put a lot of strategy for hotels after leaving Florida with a diversion into Canada before this unexpected stop.We fortunately arrived in the daytime into perhaps the worst side of the city,confronted with homeless people and bad shop fronts. We stepped into the lobby which was basically not much more than a matchbox and spoke with the 2 reception staff about our feelings of the location.We had paid a deposit online of one nights stay UD $270. After seeing two rooms, we asked if we could transfer our money to another hotel of the same chain IHG (Intercontinental) The first room had a faulty cloth Blind on the window and was unusable. It could not be fixed after staff were sent up on our arrival. The second room, like the other, had an unusual odour. The bedrooms offered an attractive bed with white linen plus a clean, perhaps newly renovated bathroom. On the downside, there was no room whatsoever to leave our cases except between the bed and side walls, and would have to stay closed at all times. We decided that security was at a risk because there was no safe except at reception, with a dubious situation that they locked their doors from 10pm each night due to the unsafe area.The staff also confirmed we were correct in our assumption, and we would have been at risk if we turned left and not right leaving the lobby into the street. After an hour of unsuccessful bidding for a fair and justifiable situation with the receptionist speaking online with their Manager Raj, it was non negotiable even though we were members with so called benefits.We then decided to take a taxi to the Fairmont and it was a huge relief to go to a safe location.As we would have had to walk the city with our passports and valuables, also no facilities we could use, we believe that we may have turned an unforeseen unsavoury situation into a total positive by leaving this hotel.All in all, do yourself a favour, and do not consider this hotel nor this Chain of hotels as there is no loyalty whatsoever to members, and even more so to basic travellers.It is a HUGE NO from us!","September 18, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

Front desk staff directed me to park where indicated just around the corner (valet stop at Cyril Magnin Street and O'Farrell Street). You'll see a sign indicating where to park. Note: Valet parking is currently $55 / night plus tax of $13.75.Location is fantastic! Especially if you love to shop! I selected this hotel primarily based on the following factors: its proximity to Union Square shopping; its proximity to catching the cable cars; and complimentary breakfast.This hotel is located very close to Macy's (on the next block) and is a short walking distance to Westfield San Francisco shopping centre and other fun places to shop. Starbucks and Boudin Bakery are quite close. Walgreens and Trader Joe's are also not too far.The Powell and Market cable car turnaround is nearby.Ask for a room on a higher floor and away from the elevator if you are a light sleeper. As other reviewers have indicated, there is a pub next door.

Easy on/off isf you want to use public transportation, and centrally located for all taxi/uber service. Lots of great resturants around, easy walking distance. The only bad news, is like many hotels in downtown San Francisco you can expect small room sizes, and a fair amount of traffic noise. But, if you want to be in the center of it all, you just have to be ok with that.

We were staying for five nights with two kids and appreciated the extra room. The hotel is relatively new and feels like it. Very sleek and urban, not imposing the cookie cutter approach more common in suburban Holiday Inn Express locations. The Wi-Fi was consistently reliable and strong. The breakfast room is compact, though well-stocked and kept clean. Margarita provided friendly service there. In fact, all of the staffer met was both affable and helpful. Main knock and could be a deal breaker for some: the hotel is right next to a pub that often has live music. You'll hear it. Management knows that but is powerless to do anything about it. We eventually fell asleep, but at times it took some doing. Our kids were too exhausted at the end of the night to be bothered. At the end of the day you have a good hotel in a great location.

This one, while fairly new, is just ""meh."" Signage is poor...2 taxis and an Uber thought I didn't know where I was going because they'd driven by it 100 times and had never seen it. Lobby is small, stark and sparse...who cares? No biggie...just saying. Room was good sized and well appointed.,,but be advised: I was on the highest floor (5th) and was nearly thumped out of my bed on Saturday night. Why? Because the adjacent pub host live music every night...but especially rollicking on Saturday. It goes on 'til 2am. I'm not opposed to a rocking good time...still, pack ear plugs....and even then I'm not sure it'll block the bass and drums. Breakfast...is served in a small room next to the small fitness area on the 2nd floor. (From a traffic and aroma standpoint, I was glad my room wasn't on that floor.) Breakfast itself was typical powdered eggs, sausage and a few cereals...Coffee was decent tho.Staff was plenty friendly. Location: Okay...Close to Union Square but SF is so overrun with homeless that I don't know where'd you stay to avoid the walking triage. Price per night was insane...the fact that I paid $1,100 for 3 nights made me hate myself for contributing to the unconscionable reaming.","August 23, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1751,"Location is key and this hotel is in a great location. Trolleys are around the corner, cable cars a few blocks away. Breakfast is included and there is a variety of items to choose from, from cereal, yogurt and oatmeal to hard boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, omelets and sausage. They even have a pancake maker. Beds are comfortable, rooms are small though.","August 16, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1752,"This place has no negatives - the front desk was friendly and accommodating (the room was without a hair dryer - they sent one up in a flash; we requested more towels - we had a stack of them within 5 minutes). The breakfast was very good, the breakfast room was clean and orderly. The location of the hotel was perfect --- steps away from great restaurants, shopping and cable cars. The beds were super comfortable. I loved this place!","August 10, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1753,This hotel was the perfect location. Access to everything. Very helpful kind staff. Great breakfast. Caution...lower floors can be loud at night. Local pub next-door does some rock and rolling. I had been warned. We had a fifth floor room. Didn't hear a thing. Beds were super comfy! ,"August 7, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1754,"I recently stayed in a holiday express and I was unsatisfied. The breakfast room is about the same size as the room if not smaller and the food selection is quite small. The elevator is the slowest in the city, you could walk up and down the stairs twice before the elevator got to your floor. The worst part was when I was trying to sleep it sounded like a bunch of dump trucks were having a roller derby on the street below. Also there is no refrigeration unit anywhere in the room. The only good thing about the place is that you walking distance to almost everywhere. ","August 4, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1755,"On a road trip coupled with the San Francisco Marathon, this was the perfect place to stay. Downtown next to Union Square & only a short walk from the start of the Marathon, it was perfectly located. Parking garage across the road, although the hotel does offer valet parking, great rooms, great king beds, all the usual amenities, breakfast included.","July 29, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1756,"This is a downtown Holiday Inn Express so logically things are likely to be on the smaller size. The staff were always friendly and keen to help in anyway they could. John (manager's name I think) has high expectations and his staff live up to them. My nephew became ill on the day we were checking out, we were given late check out until 2pm. However the hotel was fully booked that night and they could not extend it further, instead they allowed him to lie down quietly in one of the property's staff rooms, I cannot imagine many hotels going to these lengths. The rooms were spotless and size was surprisingly good for downtown. Beds were very comfortable. Everything felt new and modern.The breakfast room was small, again you're downtown and space is a premium. The breakfast room was spotless. The breakfast was good especially when considering it's just a part of the room at no additional cost. Location was excellent. 100 yards to start of cable car. 100 yards to Union Square. Walgreens around the corner for convenience. Many restaurants within 5 min walk. 40 min walk to Fisherman's Wharf. 20 min walk to Ferry Building. Very convenient. Thank you.","July 28, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1757,Brand new hotel with state of the art infrastructure. Perfectly appointed modern rooms and very clean.The breakfast room is a little small when the hotel is fully booked.The internet speed is consistently very good.Housekeeping services are discreet but excellent and the Front Desk staff are spontaneously friendly and very helpful,"July 23, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1758,"This hotel is in a great location and the rate was very good for SF. It was modern, clean, with smallish rooms and fine in general for our needs. No safe in the room. In one room, the last day we were there, the coffee maker didn't work on the day I tried it.The staff were friendly and responsive about our concerns, which led to us staying in 3 different rooms. They told us the manager was not around. In the first room the side of the bed was very close to the translucent bathroom door so at night when the other person used the bathroom and turned on the light it was enough to wake me up. We changed rooms and the location of the bed made that problem better. In the second and third rooms, at the same location in the hotel, but on different floors, we had 3 nights where the shower water was cool after the first person had a hot shower in the evening. The manager insisted that the plumbing was all new and no one else complained but we definitely had cool showers on 3 of 5 nights spent at the hotel. The manager offered us points enough for a one night stay in an IHG hotel in SF as a result of our experience.","July 15, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1759,"I booked a room with 2 twin beds through Expedia and when we arrived we arrived we were given a single queen bed. We were told that we would definitely move to a room with 2 beds the next day, as one would become vacant. When we got back from our tour the next day nothing had been arranged and we could not get the room we paid more money for again. The staff were not helpful at all and made no attempt to rectify the situation but just gave more excuses. At the end we spent 3 nights in a room we did not book. The location is very convenient but also noisy at night due to the pub next door. The rooms were small and did not have a fridge. The breakfast room had about seating for about 20 people' which was totally insufficient for the number of rooms and caused queues for breakfast. All in all a really disappointing stay.","July 14, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1760,"Small hotel (59 rooms) walking distance to everything. Clean, modern. Only downfall is the parking $60. But if you park at the corner parking lot a block and a half down it's much cheaper. We paid $35 for 24 hours. I think it was a special. I would definitely stay here again.","July 10, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1762,"This hotel only opened in Jan 2017 (so 6 months ago), and you can tell. It's fresh and clean with a modern feel. The staff are friendly and helpful also advising where not to go. NOTE: this is on the edge of the Tenderloin district, so as long as you turn right when you leave the hotel you'll be fine. I was a sole female traveler and felt safe but just something to be aware of (this is also the advice of the hotel staff). Very close to the cable car turning circle and Powell street bart stop this was easy to find and a good base to explore from. The breakfast isn't inspiring, so if you like nice and fresh big american breakfasts this isn't your place. I'd definitely stay here again.","July 4, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1763,"We stayed here for 3 nights and loved the location. A bit over a block from Union Square, Cable Cars and shopping. The rooms are spotless, beds comfortable and a nice, large shower. Hot breakfast with many choices and an attendant that replenished the food and kept the tables cleared and clean. The staff at the front desk were very nice and will help you with sightseeing choices and some tickets. Would stay here again.","June 4, 2017","29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square
