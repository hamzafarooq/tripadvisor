Check in & check out was a breeze. The room was Perfect, clean with good heating, and nightly turn down service.   Breakfast was Included & was very good. But keep in mind the restaurant is ONLY open for breakfast & there is no restaurant in the hotel for Lunch/Dinner but there are plenty of optinns for every budget right across the street.  It is 15-30 minute drive from Lisbon airport depending on traffic and cost is roughly 35Euros .  Location is excellent right in the city center with Christmas tree & lights right across the street & plenty of shopping & eating places as well as train/metro.   Highly recommend this hidden jem in"

It’s a super luxurious hotel with a plush lounge, intimate wooden bar, and a sumptuous daily breakfast in a  high ceiling, chandelier dining room.  The concierge could not have been more helpful - even took a package to the post office to mail for us.  Without any prompting from my wife or me, the hotel sent my wife a personal birthday greeting along with a bottle of champagne and a specially made dessert at breakfast.   The hotel is ideally located near the major sites and fine shopping.  We look for to returning to the Avenida Palace on our next trip."

Probably one of the real standout features was the quality of the staff;  quite simply nothing was too much.  The rooms are all beautifully and very traditionally decorated,  making it feel very special.  Breakfast was awesome although we didn't have dinner at the hotel.  Our next visit will definitely see us staying at the Avenida Palace again."

Relaxing bar with Grand Piano music coming from the main parlor. The morning breakfasts are top notch and are open until 11:30am.

While I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Lisbon, I am disappointed to write a less-than-stellar review for Avenida Palace despite all of the positive reviews that led me to book my stay in the first place. Unfortunately, a single incident soured my stay enough that I feel compelled to share the awful customer experience that I received.  On the early morning of November 12, 2021, I was returning back to Avenida Palace via cab to find that the front doors had been locked. I knocked on the glass and a security guard welcomed myself and two friends who were also staying at the hotel. We walked through the lobby towards the elevator when we heard the security guard say, “the cab driver would like to speak to you.”"

As the name implies it is a palace and once inside you feel like royalty and treated like  royalty.  It is beautifully decorated in a classic style that exudes taste and opulence.  Once inside you are transported into a different era.  It simply lacks for nothing.  Comfort, service and excellent location in downtown Lisbon. Room service at its best at all times.  Staff so polite and helpful.  The room and bathroom had all the necessary amenities which were replaced daily as needed.  Towels were replaced every day.  We were supplied with an electric kettle and teacups to replace the coffee machine as requested. The room was very quiet as it had double windows.  Excellent buffet breakfast.

No restaurant but excellent bar menu. Top class breakfast. The physical beauty of the building and the warm welcome of the hotel team are exceptional. The 'extras' are superb. In our 3 night stay, this trip, we had two beautiful piano recitals provided without charge; when it looked like raining two rain hats were delivered to our room without us asking; a 'to keep' shopping bag, i could go on and on. Courtesy, cleanliness, friendliness and exceptional surrounding all brought together by a great team."

The room was immaculate, elegant, but not to the point of feeling like you were in a museum. The staff were accommodating, helpful, respectful and anxious to make you comfortable. We were exhausted on arrival and didn't want to go restaurant hunting. (There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there are wonderful ones within a short walk.) We were served a light supper in the bar complete with a cloth laid. Most of the staff we encountered had very adequate English. The included breakfast was buffet, with wait staff on hand for assistance and coffee. Served in a wonderful elegant room. There was always a concierge on duty for advice. The recommended restaurant for one dinner was beautiful, memorable, and easy to find. The hotel"

The room was available on arrival at 10.30 AM although the official check in time is 3 PM.  The hotel public areas and rooms are very elegant. A highlight was the daily breakfast.   As for location, it is absolutely perfect for discovering the city.  The metro, railway station and bus stops are literally a minute walk form the front door."

Beautifully appointed,  spacious rooms with all the modern conveniences.  Attentive staff, anxious to meet our every need.  From the amenities in the room to the delicious breakfast, not detail was overlooked.We loved the afternoons with musical entertainment, relaxing in the elegant sitting room with an evening cocktail.   We have been all over the world  and this hotel is unsurpassed.  A convenient location near bars, restaurants, transportation and shops.  Looking forward to another stay at this fabulous hotel."

This time around I decided to give it a shot, I am so glad I did. Aside from its very central location the hotel has old world charm with a very efficient and polite staff. The corner superior room I was assigned was modern with a wall of windows. The breakfast room resembled a ballroom of a five star hotel. The breakfast itself was very good with multiple choices and a very attentive staff.  I am very happy with my decision and Avenida Palace will be my hotel of choice on future trips to Lisbon."

We enjoyed the gracious service, wonderful breakfasts, 24 hour room service, and the central location.  We are glad we chose the Avenida Palace over the Four Seasons and Valverde because of the old world charm and perfect location.  The staff is charming and unobtrusive.  When we asked for an iron for our wrinkled clothes, we were brought a perfect ""steam machine"" within five minutes.  Room service was also very quick and the food was delicious.  We are so happy we chose the Palace. It was a perfect way to enjoy Lisbon."

We had notified the hotel of our arrival time in advance and were able to check in a little early with no issue. I had booked a Double Room and since I booked directly on the hotel site, we were upgraded to a Superior Room with a view of Restauradores square. The room was large and comfortable with a king size bed, a seating area and a large bathroom. While noise from the square outside could be heard in the bathroom, there was good soundproofing in the bedroom and noise was never an issue overnight. We were treated to a Welcome fruit plate, complementary bottle of water each day as well as turndown service. The breakfast buffet had a huge selection and was the best buffet we had while staying in Portugal with a"

Helpful, attentive staff, super large room on the 4th floor overlooking the square. The hotel's old world charm meant it felt like staying in a glorious stately home rather than a hotel. We were treated to piano recitals most evenings, cocktails made to our order by the friendly barman. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. The location is outstanding - right in the heart of the action and yet the hotel is sound proofed so you are not disturbed once inside. A fabulous choice that really made our visit quite special."

We had never been to Lisbon before so we were not sure if this would be a good choice regarding location.  What a pleasant surprise.  You can't pick a better location.  We stayed there for three days before taking the train down to Faro for three days.  We were so happy with the Avenida that we booked again for three days on our return to Lisbon. The staff were so attentive and helpful.  Front desk, concierge, bar staff, breakfast staff, all went above and beyond to make our stay special. On our return they upgraded us to a suite. The expansive lounge off the front desk is a joy to sit in with groupings of antique furniture from one end to the other. We were extremely happy with our rooms, bed, bathrooms,"

Icing on the cake: the 2 tours provided by the most wonderful guest services staff ( Beatriz and her colleague).  Do not miss them.  Another kudo: the mini bar was offered complimentary. These items don’t cost much, but by making them free of charge to guests show that the hotel Management really knows how to bring the client experience to a different level altogether, instead of counting changes like most other hoteliers do."

We also took 2 massages with the team and they were so good we booked more! Best we’ve ever had!  We also ate in the restaurant for lunch and dinner and the food was always great and well priced.

So many good things about this hotel that are ideal for a weekend break/short trip.  - Rooms are great, not too small. Bed was super comfortable and I am usually very fussy on bed quality - Free massage (which needs to be booked in advance ideally), was AMAZING. One of the best massages I have ever had, and it was free (20 mins). You can pay to extend it if you want, but we did not. It is not a gimmicky massage, but a proper full body massage - Two free walking tours every day around the city. We did ours with Beatriz who was great. The tours are not too long, and a great way to get to know the city.  - Lovely welcome gift of wine/strawberries for us. - Hotel"

Both walking tours are excellent - informative, in terms of history and culture, and fun. Both tours are free and exclusive to hotel guests.  The service throughout the hotel is outstanding.

H10 Duque de Loule is a great hotel, however, a bit far away from the tourist attractions – if one wants to walk. Be advised that Lisboa is like San Francisco, and takes a great deal of physical strength – if one wants to explore on foot.  The hotel is only 6 years old and is described as a “Boutique Hotel” which means less than 100 rooms and more personal and intimate focus on the customer. Yes, to that.    Breakfast was more than adequate – but the guest couldn´t choose their free table on their own… they were assigned by the waiter…! Please, change this…  I was in Lisboa during Covid-19 restriction which meant that all bars closed at 22:30 –"

The breakfast - wow. We had the Deluxe room for 3. It was very spatious (38m) and comfortable. The location of the room is at the 10th floor where the rooftop is (so in fact the roooftop was our private balcony :) ). The staff was very kind and helpful. They offer complimentary cava at the reciption but only if you ask. The hotel is 20 min from the center by foot. Very nice not tourist trap restaurants in the surroundings (5 mins from the hotel towards the center)."

As soon as we entered the lobby, we were greeted with a Portuguese cake and a glass of sparkling wine. What a start.  Room was very nice, spacious and perfectly clean. The rooftop bar was not working but food can be ordered at the other bar  and then taken to the rooftop that has such a beautiful view of the city and the river. Hotel food was very good offering both buffet and a la carte menu for breakfast. There is a bit of a walk down to the city and main attractions via Avenida da Liberdade but if you don't fancy walking - metro station is 2 minutes walk from the hotel. If we visit Lisbon again - this is the place we will stay!"

The management team is stellar and extremely helpful; they pay close attention to detail and bend over backwards to help make your experience a memorable one.  I love this hotel!   It's unique and it feels very quaint yet it offers all the amenities you need.  The roof top bar is fantastic, and the breakfast is well decorated with a beautiful display of food.   The price is reasonable, and the service is stellar.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone in Lisbon.  It's located in the city area and everything is within walking distance so it's strategically placed.  I LOVE the H10 TEAM.  They rock"

The interior is beautiful and the entire hotel is very clean. Our room was very nicely furnished and had a nice bathroom. The bed is large and soft. We could hear a peep whenever somebody in one of the rooms close to us was using the shower I think, which was a little annoying, but it wasn't very loud so it didn't bother me too much.  Almost every day when we returned from exploring the city our key card didn't work and we had to go back to the lobby to get it fixed. It's weird that this kept happening.  The wifi is horrible, which is a shame since I had to work on a project. Even checking social media was difficult. They do have computers you can use in the lobby.  The breakfast is amazing. A lot of choice, and they even prepare things like"

Great food and breakfast. Roof top bar is beautiful even though the service there could be better. The room was very nice with open balcony. Location was great.

A beautiful hotel in a great location.  Rooms were bright and very clean and comfortable with a great shower.  Coffee machine and safe provided and kettle supplied on request.  Staff were very efficient and friendly.  Food was great in both the restaurant and bar, and the breakfast selection and service was excellent.  Staff were really helpful and accommodating in reorganising our stay after we had to cancel due to Covid lockdown in Uk.  I would be happy to recommend this hotel for a stay in Lisbon and hope to go back again in the future."

This is such a shame because the standard is high in every other respect.  Our corner room couldn't have been more comfortable with a huge and good quality bed, quiet air conditioning and plenty of cupboard space.  We really enjoyed the breakfast each day (we stayed for 6 nights).  There's a very extensive and freshly topped up buffet, and you can also order freshly cooked items.  One bottleneck at breakfast was the coffee machine, which frequently had queues and was running out of water/milk.  One final improvement might be to provide fresh bottled water in the room for every night of the stay - however there is a supermarket right opposite which sells bottled water."

The rooms are spacious and clean. The hotel is well located only a few minutes walk from Marques de Pombal Metro station and other bus connections. It took us 15 - 20 minutes to walk into the centre from the hotel.  The roof top has amazing views and we felt that the food there was reasonably priced.  The staff at the hotel are just amazing!!! Honestly we felt that they were actually happy to be taking their time and serving people. Keep up the good work. We had an issue with noise from above our room, and were relocated to a quieter room without any fuss."

The staff are so caring, friendly and professional they really care about their customers. On my birthday I was surprised with a gift from the staff that I really wasn’t expecting I couldn’t thank them enough.

Every evening I came back to the no fresh towels on the floor since I left them to be washed. Swimming pool is not included in the price and you have to pay + wear a cap - so you have to also buy a cap there.  Breakfast is really poor, had to go eat outside."

The metro is only 20 meters from the hotel itself and the bed quality is really good! A thing that could be better are the prices at the bar. It’s really expensive in comparison with the prices in Lisbon itself.

The immediate area around the hotel itself is fairly boring, business like, although a few nice restaurants to be found. The rooftop pool and bar really makes the hotel although the pool temperature was pretty bracing in October and could have done with a couple of degrees heating - it’s probably perfect in the peak heat of summer. The buffet breakfast was very good; the buffet dinner not so much - a fairly limited selection,"

We liked the breakfasts - a selection of cold and warm dishes, nice pastries, juices... The highlight was definitely the rooftop bar and pool. It is not a big pool, but great to cool off. There is another pool downstairs in the spa, but we did not try that (mostly meanth for adults enjoying the treatments there) The hotel is not so near the city center, but it is very close to the yellow metro, but also blue and red are in a short walking distance. Metro was the best option for travelling as any ground traffic suffered from traffic jams, while metro was on time... There are many great restaurants nearby and also a bull fighting arena (now partly a shopping center ;) !"

On Avenida Liberdade are some expensive restaurants, which are very good, if thats your thing.

We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in October to celebrate my husband's birthday, we booked a deluxe room which was huge and comfortable. The hotel delivered cava, chocolates & custard pies, a lovely surprise. Every member of staff were curtious and helpful, especially the gentleman and Ines who checked us in and gave us a map of the area and explained where everything is in the city. I also must mention Hugo who walked us across the courtyard to show us where the rooftop bar is situated, very helpful and friendly , he made us feel very welcome. The location is cental to everything, I would most definitely recommend and return in the future."

We were there for the weekend for my wife's birthday. The hotel gave us an upgrade plus sent up a bottle fizz and cake on the night of her birthday.

The location is also great !  We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone !"

Centrally located just off the Rossio and overlooking a pedestrianised street. My deluxe room was spacious and well decorated and overlooked a courtyard which backed on to its sister hotel, Hotel Mundial. I had asked for a kettle and this was in the room waiting for me.  Bed extremely comfortable and interior shutters blocked out light at night. The staff on reception were exceptionally helpful and friendly. For comfort, location and quietness this hotel is unbeatable."

When arriving from the airport we used the metro. It’s the red line from airport to alameda where we changed and then caught another tram to Rossio. When arriving at Rossio it’s literally 5 mins away. The hotel staff were extremely helpful. Gave us plenty of advice on where to eat and made bookings where necessary. They kindly assisted in printing of some paperwork for our return journey home. The rooms were clean and we were in room 409 which had a tub and quite spacious. It was my birthday when arriving and they sent some Prosecco and chocolate truffles to the room. A great hotel to stay and centrally located. Would definitely recommend this hotel if visiting Lisbon!

Important to point out is that one could order two of these salads. These were included in the breakfast price.  The most disappointing was that yet another hotel does not recognise single customers and charge them price for double room and double breakfast. A discount for single breakfast would be at least expected.

Arriving from the train station by taxi, we entered the door facing Avenida da Liberdade and carried our luggage down a short flight of stairs.

The staff are friendly enough. There's free port or muscatel in the lounge. If you book and are over the age of 50 you get a free museum pass. But overall it's not very scintillating. There is no proper dining room - you have to sit eating your breakfast on low soft seating with the table kind of above you. The breakfast is good enough, but no more. We would choose somewhere a bit more enticing next time.  One little whinge. We came in one afternoon and requested a capuccino. 'No problem'. It came - made with those sachets of sweet instant powder that they serve on Turkish buses. But this is a hotel! And we had to pay for it!"

We couldnt fault the staff or hotel, it was warm and friendly. the room although a little old fashioned was in keeping with the hotel and very large and comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and gallons of hot water from a high pressure shower was welcome.  The staff brought us sparkling wine the first evening and wished us a happy anniversary which was a lovely touch and made us feel so special.  The breakfast is very nice, buffet style and plenty of choice. we ate in the panoramic resturant the last night. Although v nice it was a bit chilly in there in november and the view hampered by the internal lights. I think it would work better for lunch.  WE would highly reccomend"

The breakfast is delicious, rooms are clean and tidied every day. I have nothing bad to say about the hotel and the basics which you require are here and work well. There is nothing above the average hotel here though, no actual facilities, no bar (except the roof top which is very busy and quite expensive), the restaurant  is so expensive to dine that we did not bother but does look quite good, there are no tea making facilities within the room which was disappointing for a Brit and it cost 8 Euro for tea by room service. So all in all, lovely basic hotel and does the job!"

No iron or kettle in the room. 2 adults but given two single beds. Nothing special or personal touch, celebrated 2 birthdays and 2 anniversaries in lockdown and notified hotel in advance. (10 years anniversary). Ordred room service and tray and cups left for 2days, not taken away when room cleaned. Breakfast very very basic.  Room clean and modern but bathroom very outdated.

I can highly recommend this hotel and restaurant, the staff are very attentive and helpful. We will certainly be coming back to Lisbon and staying in this hotel.  Thank you for some great memories."

Very well located being about a 10 mins walk from the nearest metro stop (40 mins in total from the airport) and right outside a tram stop.    The hotel has a roof top bar with heaters given the cooler evenings in Nov.   I had breakfast included in my deal and the choice of breakfast was excellent as well - great selection.  I would like to highlight Andrea on the customer service desk who assisted me with inputting my data for my UK locator form as I was having technical problems on my phone.  She was incredibly patient and helped me through what was a slightly stressful time getting the document submitted!!  Couldn't recommend the hotel enough.    Lisbon is a beautiful city with great restaurants and sights.

The hotel is located in Baixa district which is the heart for shopping and close to many touristic sights.  Breakfast is very basic, and includes the default selection of bacon, sausages and beans as well as eggs, omelets and a small variety of vegetables, you have some fruit salad and yogurts as well as morning cereals.  The HUGE downside of this hotel however is the BAD acoustics and isolation that my room had. My room was at the sixth floor and I could hear every door slam in my corridor as well as people chatting outside my room as they were passing by as if my room has no door.

The room was spacious and clean, with comfortable beds. The bathroom was a bit old and outdated though, with an old shower. The head of the shower couldn't be fixed, so you had to hold it in your hand while showering. Breakfast buffet was nice and covid-19 proof.

Having stayed in Lisbon on previous occasions a little way outside of the historic centre, I found it much more convenient to be in a hotel so central.  Considering the restrictions on travelling during the pandemic, it was interesting to find that the hotel appeared to be very full. Mask wearing was mandatory throughout public areas and temperature checks of guests and other visitors were routinely made on entering.   My room itself was of an average size with efficient air conditioning and although it overlooked a busy road, it was quiet with the windows closed. Mini-bar, room safe and plenty of wardrobe space was provided. Very wide range of English language TV"

Later, at my second floor room, I opened a white-draped window facing out over the  light of the afternoon and gazed at the wide expanse of the view.

For comparison, we stayed in another hotel for 3 nights before in Lisbon (4*) and roamed in its sister hotel in Alfama which deepened even further our disappointment.

You can wait in the Lobby on your own without anyone noticing.  - Lobby / Main room  The patio is nice but really, nothing fancy. Style is minimal, a bit kitsch. Not a place where you'd feel like : wow, what is that ? Beautiful arrangement, that would feel nice in your home. The main dining area is worse.

But it is the incredible staff that really make this place our favorite place to stay (not just in Lisbon, but anywhere).  They are friendly and welcoming upon arrival and go to great lengths be helpful with whatever we need...from booking Fado tickets, recommending restaurants to extreme things like putting together a list of good places to take Portuguese lessons (including dong some internet research on each place to make sure their recommendations got good reviews).

The room was spotless and very comfortable and we had a wonderful view of the river.  We would definitely stay here again, thanks!"

A 5-star experience, in all aspects. Modern renovations elevate this cozy space. Our room was gracefully appointed and was comfortable. We enjoyed views of the Tejo River from the balcony.  In addition to the space being phenomenal the staff also matched this high standard by being friendly and resourceful. The owner took time to speak with  us about the hotel’s rich history adding a distinctive touch. Dinner at their sidewalk café Audrey’s included menu items from their own garden,  creating a farm to table experience in the heart of Lisbon! Our time there was well spent."

Manual was a fun conversationalist, the staff at the cafe remembered my allergy and prepared the morning mixed juice without the culprit ingredient.

Lana in reception is exceptional and helped us with all of our needs. Kusum at the restaurant was very sweet and attentive. Manuel spoke with us at breakfast for a time.

The service is 10/10 and they are able to help with food/entertainment recommendations as well as scheduling COVID testing for travel or car service. The hotel is located next to the old trolley 28 stop at Miradouro Sta. Luzia and I highly recommend taking a ride on the historic trolley. Beautiful views of the skyline across the river just a few steps away from the hotel and a few minutes walk

The food at Audrey's Restaurant is wonderful, as is the service - from the moment one walks in to the moment one leaves - with sadness that the stay with the staff has ended so quickly.

We then went to the bar area for a a meal!  The seating area has been changed which was a positive. However the noise from the lobby area was horrendous.

Breakfast was ok but the staff there (all teenagers) did not meet my expectations. A lack of customer care and approach was a big minus.

I arrived after a transatlantic flight at 11:30 am - the hotel charged me €40 to check in before 2 pm.  I know they are entitled to do this, but more often than not, hotels will let you check in early (and unfortunately I don't have Wyndham status).

You'll be fine if like me, all you have is carry-on luggage.

But the way they attract is clearly fraudulent.   They claim on their web site that they have low rates (€ 74 as far as I was concerned) and then get you to a so called ""secured"" booking website where you find your-self with more than the room rate added supposedly because of ""taxes"" (which taxes, no one knows but certainly not the usual local tax which you have to add on arrival).  It is not easy at all to find out about this tax before paying and of course the payment is non reimbursable even in these difficult pandemic times.   Basically this is fraud.  First they advertise low rates that they top up with so called taxes then they make you pay additional for the real tax.  Of course"

Day before confirmed a late arrival.  All should have been OK. The payment had been taken from the credit card as well. When arriving about 22.30 to the hotel all was closed. After a while found a piece of paper on a glass door with info:  go to another hotel, TRYP nearby.  Very good. About 30-40 people had already done that and were there waiting for a room for the night, very short night!! Only one person checking people in. Had been much more polite to send an email or SMS about changes, even a phone call had been nice. Also some information on that piece of paper too about the reason.  Have been staying in this hotel before, but not going to book it anymore!."

However on 28th April I have been charged for a no show and now have the hassle of a chargeback. I think this is probably deliberate.

And being honest it’s not even a nice restaurant…  So before to come here ensure you have book all Your restaurants evenings because otherwise you will Be like us eating at the sky bar some room service food (even then the ceasar salad was bad)… We came for our second time but we will definitely not come a 3rd one ! Much better to stay in the center at least it will be easier to find a restaurant other than a shopping mall corner food….

Prepare for long waits.   We choose the hotel for the location as we were going to the aquarium. I would normally stay in the centre which is much nicer. The hotel is Close to the train station and to the shopping centre, cable car etc good location to access all amenities and also you could get the train into the centre easily.

This hotel isn't right at the city centre although it is within 5 minutes from the tube which has made it easily accessible for us, the location wasn't a problem at all.

Difficult to ask for more. The room was neat. No flaws to point at regarding furniture and hygiene. Amazing mattress and pillows. The site is beautiful and the art and decoration are an attraction on their own right. (a booklet explaining the art available for the guests would be a great addition).

We did not have breakfast, so I cannot give an opinion about it. I recommend this hotel, and I plan to go back to it next time I travel to Lisbon."

Well located in the heart of Lisbon, but a quite street. Personal is nice and helpful, and the breakfast is good and with a wide variety ok products. It is not a super-modern hotel, but it has an exquisite decoration which makes it adorable from the moment you cross de door. Rooms are comfortable and I adore their towels. And lots of plugs, which is important!"

We were immediately charged for the rooms and they were 100% refundable if cancelled 7 days prior to the stay.  We cancelled the reservations on March 12th and 10 days later we are still waiting for the amount to be refunded.  It would seem if they have the ability to instantaneously charge my credit card they could refund my money a lot sooner than this is taking.

The hotel is in a fantastic location, more or less between Barrio  Alto and Chiado. Everything is within walking distance but it’s a very hilly city so we opted use the electric scooters a couple of times to get about.   The rooms are really modern and sleek, we stayed in an executive double which really well presented.   Breakfast is self service, continental style but there are scrambled eggs, bacon, etc etc for those that want something close to an English breakfast.

Amazingly modern facilities with all amenities, best location in Lisbon, and best of all was the kind and genuine staff. It's noisy at night in this party district and equally fun and fascinating. Not the place you want if quiet is all you seek. After decades of travel in many countries, only one hotel in Milan had a breakfast so fine.  The rooftop bar is a great place to watch evening light on the castle and city. Only downside is bedding is a comforter that's a bit warm for summer sleeping, but the room's AC helps keep it comfortable. We'll be going back in a few weeks, looking forward to it."

We were not happy to have paid for bed and breakfast to be told that the breakfast room was closed and we would have to use vouchers at a nearby cafe (which was good), thus disrupting our morning routine. TV didn't work in the room so changed rooms.

I could barely move around the bed, but it was enough for me. It was extremely loud because the walls are super thin and you can hear people in the hallway or going in and out of their rooms.

I was surprised scrambled eggs were complimentary however poached costs €2.00 arriving out in solitary splendour. Positives: good central location close to restaurants, trams, shops and city sights."

SERVICE: The front desk was great - I couldn't get in touch with a restaurant that I wanted reservations for, and the Front Desk did it for me before our arrival.  ROOMS: Smallish, but tidy. The outer rooms with the city views are better than the interior. Bathrooms have been updated. Serviceable.  OTHER: Breakfast was good - staff changed out the variety a little bit each day, and they always had mini pasteis de nata available, which was quite nice.  SUMMARY: One of the best features is location - a quick walk to Praca Commercio, trams, subway - very convenient."

Rua Augusta is a pedestrian only street which connects to Praca de Comercio.  Room rates are reasonable.  Rooms are moderate.    The hotel is also very near the metro station Baxia- Chiado.  The airport bus also passes in front.  It is also near Praca dom Pedro IV.  Consider 7 hotel for a Lisbon stay. You can walk, take the bus or the metro system to get around.  Look for the red façade building.  The signage is small. It can be a challenge to find the hotel for a first time Lisbon visitor where all streets look the same and some parts are hilly."

I was not able to check in early, I did not receive 5 euros credit ( staff had no idea about that one even though it is on their website).

He said its not his job to help guests and he laughed in my face when I said I would complain to the manager.

On arrival, it smelled of sewage as well as had previous guests’ hair plastered on the walls, sink and shower. I assume that the smell of sewage was due to the fact that the bathroom wasn’t really separate to the room, it was only frosted glass that was between the bed and the “bathroom”.

Think of it as a two-star rather than the advertised three stars to avoid disappointments. I paid 65€ a night, without breakfast, which was probably more or less what the place was worth.  The first room they tried to give me (434) was awful. It was basically a long, narrow corridor with a bed and a sofa bed. The receptionist also claimed there would be a bathtub in the room, but there wasn’t.  I was then given room 101, which was a lot better. It was large, but very worn-out. There were frosted glass windows to an inner courtyard of sorts, although it looked more like a dumpster. The fitted carpet was dusty and the room had a stuffy smell to it.

Ibis Hotel Malhoa is clean but very small for 2 people. We arrived at the airport almost at midnight and do not want to get a cab too far to the City.  This hotel is walking distance to the Sete-Rios Rede Express but if you have a lot of luggage, I suggest to take Uber.   If you plan to stay for more than a night, it's possible if you're by yourself because the space around the bed are too tight you have to walk sideways to get access.

Hotel White checked off all of the boxes for us.  The only thing some people would not like is that it is a little far from the city center(25-30 min walk), however, the metro line is literally steps away from the hotel door.    Bed was super comfy and air conditioning worked very well.  We opted for the breakfast option and it served us well but was nothing special.    Staff was great, always willing to answer any of our questions and made our stay extra enjoyable.    We went up to the roof top pool once (in the rain) to look at it.  Very small, but would of been real nice to utilize.  We spent too much time exploring so never took advantage.  Our visit was end of September so wasn’t exactly pool weather either.    Happy we chose this hotel and would recommend"

We had a very nice room, but 2 twin beds pushed together when we had booked a deluxe double. Sliding door to the bathroom - personal preference would be for one you can close properly! We were on the 9th floor so had a balcony which was a plus. Breakfast was OK - continental and not a particularly inspiring selection. There's a metro stop right outside, which was very handy, and it only a minute's walk to the Versailles cafe which is where we had a delicious breakfast both days."

It is bang next to Saldanha Metro with easy connections into the rest of Lisbon.  The metro fares at 1 Euro 50 cents for any ride is so cheap (especially compared to London) and when we left we got the metro straight to the airport - again for 1.50!!! We arrived from our cruise at 10 o'clock and although check in is supposed to be 15.00 they let us in straight away which made a huge difference to our day.  The Reception Staff are excellent - helpful and friendly.  We only had to ask for an adapter or a glass of orange and they were there!!

Very clean modern design. Extremely comfortable beds. Nice rooms well fitted out. Lovely rooftop pool area with great views. Young keen helpful staff. Secure underground parking just across the street.   There are lots of good places to eat and drink close by.  Pastelaria Versailles is brilliant for pastries and wonderful for breakfast. Galeto is another Lisbon institution just across the road. If you don’t fancy eating there it’s great for a nightcap. Taxis are inexpensive and plentiful so getting around the city is easy. A very good place to stay.

Hotel White Lisboa offers all of this. It is situated right by the entrance to the Saldana Metro station. It is spotlessly clean, the standard rooms were comfortable. The rooms and bathrooms were small, but more than adequate for a city break and the shower was one of the best I have encountered in any hotel.

Our rooms were beautiful, clean and had air con which was greatly appreciated. The hotel is on a busy main road but we heard absolute no noise on the second floor, facing the road. The breakfast was of usual continental standard, there was plenty of choice to eat.  We absolutely loved the roof top pool. Bare in mind though, it is only small with around 8 sun beds.

Rooftop pool was great but only about 8 sun beds up there. The freezing cold water and high winds made it near impossible to go in. Still - it was a nice place to hang out for an hour or two in the late afternoon. If it’s not too hot you can walk everywhere but with the heat of the summer we decided to take the metro which was quick easy and cool. It’s about a forty minute walk to Rossio area and about 20 mins to Eduardo park - nice to do in the evening. But to get to anywhere else you’ll need the metro or bus. There aren’t many signs"

Their greatest asset being the impeccable cleanliness and the location of the hotel close to the metro and in the heart of Lisbon.  The hotel is open 24 hours a day with a nice pool. The staff is very warm and kind.  Regarding the lack of the hotel I would say the lack of insulation that we can easily hear the neighbors and the fact that we are watched by the staff when we have lunch.  But it didn’t affect our stay at this hotel for 10 days.  Thank you!

A short minute walk to anywhere you want to go.   The service is minimal so if you are high maintenance might not be for you. Little things like you have to check your own bags after check out for the whole day there is no bell hop and you are responsible for the 2 flights up to carry your bags. I recommend getting that key before you check out to save a step in going back up and down the stairs.   The views from the windows are great and there is a very fun music video Chanel that makes getting ready a blast."

Breakfast was very disappointing, when we arrived about three quarters of the tables were free but all had  dirty tablecloths covered in debris from previous guests so had to sit at a dirty table.

The staff did not help making this place better either, no info on breakfast room, coffee room, baggage room badly explained etc etc. I have stayed in several hotels in Lisbon in the past and this was definitely the worst ever and not worth the price.

The walls were paper thin every move and shower from the next room were very clearly audible.  Being very near the station the noise at times was loud but bearable. The shower was good and the room was cleaned every day. The towels were small and rough but changed frequently. The safe had no key at the outset.

The staff were very nice and the room was clean. Although the hotel is in the busy city centre, the rooms are very quiet. Our room was very small and cramped. When we got home we found out that we had booked and paid for an Superior room but were given a Standard room. I don't think this was intentional but check your booking when you get your room. The safe in the room is a bit of a joke because it can be picked up and carried out. But all in all I would recommend this hotel if you are in Lissabon for a few days."

Room, small but clean. No key available for safe in room. Hairdryer was very bashed and worked for 2 minutes then stopped until it cooled down, no use for 2 ladies! Girl On reception was very helpful and allowed us to use dryer in an empty room but man on reception next day was extremely unhelpful and directed us to the 'lady of the housekeeping' who was just rude! Breakfast was basic but not inedible."

I was abit anxious about the trip but the hotel was really easy to find! Literally out of Rossio station and it’s round the corner. Plenty of eateries around and a supermarket next door which was really helpful. I arrived before check in time and luckily was able to place my bag in the luggage room so I didn’t have to carry it around all day with me. This was excellent. The room was perfect for what I wanted. The bed was comfy and the room was clean. The bathroom was a little on the small side and the hot water temperature in the shower was abit hit and miss so you do have to watch you don’t get burnt. However the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The location is ideal for exploring Lisbon. You

I fear I arrived at the hotel hours before the check in. The concierge - I’m sorry for not remembering your name - has done ALL she could to allow me to access the room as she understood my situation.   The amenities are adequate but you’d expect a tad more from a 4* hotel. Other than that it was very handy but you’ll need to go to reception if you need anything (that’s what happened to me when I requested a toothbrush).  Bed is unfairly amazing! I did struggle a lot to wake up the following morning and I had to take a nap through the day!  Walk in shower and toilet are perfect, the view to the back of the hotel is appalling.

The rooms are dingy and old. TV and lamp didn’t work in room. The restaurant was open, however they didn’t have enough people there apparently,as it took 30 mins to get a drink and another hourish my food. It was a tasty meal once it arrived though. It felt like a 2 star hotel. The floor I was on had bicycle gear laying outside door-gross!!! I paid $125 and expected a bit more. Utterly appalled by this hotel"

Excellent check in with attentive and friendly staff. Henrique also later put us into a cab to a traditional restaurant he made reservations for on our behalf; it was SUPERB and we would never have found it on our own.

I stayed 3 nights in total with 2 days imbetween and the larger 32m2 room on the fourth floor was meant to be more luxurious but was the worst, we had terrible very  loud creaking noise every hour throughout the night but when we said at the reception no one was really interested, it’s a shame as I’ve used this hotel every time I’ve been in Lisbon and encouraged my friends to as well"

For a family of 5 this was really not good and sadly not only did the hotel have no maintenance available but also no manager. We were offered NO compensation at all for this and I felt we should not have paid. The breakfast too was really mediocre. The hotel is convenient for the airport but that’s about it!

The hotel is perfectly placed for access to the airport but the rooms are tired and in need of refurbishment. The staff were helpful and friendly and we didn’t have a problem with noise as Portugal was in lockdown so no bike racers on the highway !

The property felt old and tired and in dire need of a renovation, the room decor felt dated but the bed was really comfy. The breakfast currently on offer too was a pretty poor selection but that is likely a product of Covid-19.   Proximity to the airport was the best thing about this hotel though being probably only 5 minutes away from the terminal by taxi."

The receptionist was very polite and disponible, they let us to leave the luggages before the chek in at 14. The structure was very clean,  the room was very big with a bed that i never seen one like that, a gigant bed. My experience was really good.  The restaurant it wasn't very good, i talk about the carbonara that i ordered.

But there had to be several mishaps from the start. Briefly: 1) We booked a room with  a double bed well in advance. After a check-in we are coming to our designated floor and...into a room with two separate beds. Went straight back to the reception to find out that they have run out of rooms with double beds (a pandemic honeymoon weekend in the hotel?). Not a good enough excuse for a booking made beforehand! However, they upgraded us to a double bed after a short conversation. 2) The room we were given was so spacious! Enough space to dance and do somersaults, in fact. But...the lighting was totally inadequate and (maybe because of the Covid) a total"

Facing the street and the train station but a decent sized balcony and not noisy at night at all, we slept fine. The pillows are massive, one wasn’t enough for me, two was too many. I did ask for a thinner pillow but they don’t have any options so I used one of the bedspreads folded and it worked fine. You get shower gel and shampoo, a shower cap and soap. The room had a coffee machine but the coffee pods are chargeable, I think they were €1.75. Very good coffee all over central Lisbon at €1, but if you’re desperate... Good breakfast, no complaints at all. Reception staff were pleasant. We didn’t use the hotel’s bar or room service as there are so many options locally. I recommend walking 8-10 mins to Pastelaria Mexicana for toasted sandwiches,"

Our triple room had a huge balcony overlooking the city and there was plenty of room to move about for three people. It was very clean and very modern. Secondly, the service was very good both at the front desk and bar. Finally, this is close enough to be able to walk to several shops and restaurants (might I recommend Hamburgeria 21 which is about 10 minutes away, it's cash only but wonderful hamburgers and well-priced drinks).

My husband is coeliac. Staff offered no assistance as to which food he could access. He was given 2x gf buns however there was no tomato and no gf information regarding jam. When I asked for 2x boiled or poached eggs as we had been able to access in other hotels I was told no without paying extra. Since we were already providing his own milk this didn't seem fair. I attempted to discuss this with reception staff who said they would talk to management plus I emailed management but got no response. So if you are coeliac stay somewhere else as food allergies are not well catered for.

I must say that it is clean, comfortable and the staff is nice. But there are quite a few low points. The breakfast food choice is rather limited; you are given very few toiletries (in my case those were not replenished at all during my 5 day stay); and the minibar offer is dissapointing (you are not even given free tea/coffee). Keep also in mind that it is rather far from the centre, but very close to the airport. Good for business purposes, not the best for a cozy holiday!"

Extremely comfy Queensize with many different pillows.  I had business in the area; location was therefore obviously great.  I didn't especially like the breakfast selection; the fact that the Nespresso machine wasn't free (never seen that before); the unhygienic wall-to-wall carpeting; that WiFi required to switch the TV on; and that there were hardly any plugs (ONE in the bed area; who doesn't need two?).

Couple of things for me which stop it being a 4 star such as the comfort of the bed, you end up waking up everyday with ear pain because of the pillows. Likewise there is an expectation it seems from the cleaning staff there that you will leave the hotel room at 9am as they will relentlessly knock on your door for housekeeping early in the morning which is quite annoying especially if you are one (like myself) who likes to sleep a bit on holidays. The staff downstairs can be awesome, but the second they get busy with one customer they will leave you there waiting(for at least 20 minutes) which was also a bit disappointing.

Night time noise can be an issue if windows are open and cigarette smoke from the street can enter into the rooms.  The breakfast was OK - european-style with cheese, meats, toast/jam.  The pancakes were also good.  The rooms are not air conditioned and if you are fortunate you can receive a fan (thus open windows).  The website advertises laundry though I discovered that laundry facilities are not offered on site.  The rooms do not have any TV.  On the whole, the building was clean, staff were welcoming and the experience was average."

Super nice staff and organized well as the private room are separated from the dorms, making it a better environment for couples.  The rooms are a little noisy, but the facilities are great and rooms are clean and nice.  The breakfast is also to recommend!"

Nice kitchen where they serve breakfast. Personal very friendly and   helpful. Negative: only 2 toilets per floor. Of the 2 showers one was missing the shower hose! !! One of the showers needs painting, very humid, and had nothing to hang your clothes or leave your stuff. Our 4 beds room was next to the kitchen on the 2nd floor, which was the only place to meet others, therefore very loud, in addition our windows were facing the kitchen...were some smoked, and we could not close them properly.

My wife and I got a double room. When we got to the hostel it was full of construction materials at the entrance. Then at reception they said nothing and gave us a room at the 4th floor. Once we were there, we realized they were renovating the place and people working at the time (Saturday 8pm - noisy). The place wasn't closed due to works and therefore a cold air stream. We asked the receptionist for extra blankets or a heater and she never came back to us, but when we saw her she said they were full and no extra blankets nor heaters. Important to mention that the room was just painted and it had a strong smell. That same night at 4am we woke up after hearing doors hitting due to wind. I had to get up and fix it however I could, using toilet paper to avoid"

It's not in the centre but you can walk there within 15 minutes. The staff is friendly and the free breakfast is great. My room was really unique and an incredible value since it was a private. However it was very cold in the room, and I was next to the staircase so it was pretty noisy. Also it's not a very social place. There isn't a good place to hang out and meet people which takes away from the atmosphere a bit. But if you are looking for a comfortable and more relaxing pace to stay, this is your place."

The location is amazing - a short walk or Uber ride to everything, and on a quiet street.  The room was very clean and we loved that it included a Nespresso maker.  This isn't a traditional hotel, but a small boutique property.  There is typically one person at the front desk who may or not be there when you check in/check out, and the door is locked at night and you are provided a code to enter.  One other good thing of note - they have a million TV channels in English, when you are looking to relax and just watch something on TV."

Seemingly right at the ""corner"" of the Chido, Barrio Alto and Baixa.  Adjacent to the Rossio train station, and a few blocks to the Baixa-Chiado Green/Blue line Metro.  The only caution would be if you had limited mobility, there's no ""flat"" way to get to the"

The tiled floors would have been cooling in the summer and despite its central location the double glazing meant it was beautifully quiet."
Casa Balthazar,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g189158-d2578274-Reviews-or5-Casa_Balthazar-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html#REVIEWS,This was a peaceful boutique hotel in the middle of Lisbon. It was beautifully appointed with lovely artwork and design. It had a sophisticated country feel but was smack in the middle of the very cool Chiado district. We got a jacuzzi terrace room which was amazing because of the view. The jacuzzi did take over 10 hours to warm up to 40 degrees celsius though so we weren't able to really enjoy it until the morning of our departure unfortunately since we only stayed for 1 night.

We kicked off our honeymoon in Lisbon, and they had a bottle of sparkling wine waiting in the room, which was so nice. It is a must to stay in one of the jacuzzi rooms.

The hosts couldn’t have been nicer and made us feel welcome throughout the stay. Due to COVID breakfast was delivered to the room on a tray with a nice selection of fruits, ham and cheese, a selection of rolls and pastries.

Though literally steps from several busy restaurants (all with outdoor seating), inside the walls of Casa Balthazar there is a calm and peaceful atmosphere. Our room, the Duplex, was huge, with its own rooftop terrace that gave a wonderful view over the hills of Lisbon.

All the staff were so kind and helpful with information on where to eat and what to do. It was such a nice relaxing start to our Portugal trip!"

The hotel's location is excellent. Close to useful public transport options as well as excellent bars and hotels. Despite the proximity to these, once inside all was an oasis of calm and peace.   We had the Duplex Terrace which is located just inside the main entrance and so feels like you're in a private home. There are lots of stairs to this accommodation, not much of an inconvenience but could be a challenge to people with lots of luggage, etc.   The first floor comprised the living / kitchen / dining area.

It happened to be fully booked when I was arriving so I booked the sister hotel . . . The PortoBay Marques and I absolutely loved it. The staff were amazing and the room was beyond perfect. I was so impressed that I made it a point to have lunch at the PortoBay Liberdade and that was also amazing. So when I moved on to Porto I naturally booked the ProtoBay Teatro in the center of everything. That was also an amazing experience which I will never forget.  My bucket list now has a new item . . . Visit each and every PortoBay hotel in Portugal and maybe even Brazil.

Although the country had just a few cases, the hotel was well-prepared, with measures already in place to protect its guests, so I felt pretty safe whilst there. Upon arrival, I was greeted by one of the front desk employees and received a room upgrade. The room was very spacious, with a small kitchen which even had a microwave. This is very convenient in case you want to have breakfast/dinner in your room. Bathrooms are also spacious and equipped with Rituals toiletries. No all rooms have a bathtub, though.

The location is perfect. Not too far from the city centre and quite peaceful. You can walk along the fashionable Avenida de Liberdade and may sights are within walking distance. Alternatively you can use the inexpensive public transport facilities or take a taxi. The hotel itself is super. Professional staff, good breakfast, a nice Italian restaurant on site, nice and well-equipped relatively small rooms (we booked a standard room). The small rooftop pool is surrounded by deckchairs; a perfect place to relax after a busy day. All the PortoBay hotels that we’ve stayed at have met our expectations. Definitely recommended!"

A special mention also to Ana who we received fantastic service from when we dined in the hotel's restaurant on the first night (so much so, we also booked in again for our final evening!)

There is another ""Portobay"" near to it but the Marques appears less pretenious and better for it. The rooms and facilities are of a very, very good standard - and the service levels and general professionalism / friendliness of the staff is outstanding.  Breakfast provides an excellent choice of food in the nicely laid out resturant, and the dinner choices are mainly aligned to an Itailian theme.  The food we had was very acceptable with great service. When we visited, the two Portabay hotels in the location each gave an incentive (free pud/ or glass of wine) to use each others resturant and we tried both (offers are not surprising as there are so many good eating places in Lisbon).

Our room was small but comfortable enough. The hotel benefits from a nice rooftop terrace bar although the 'pool' in reality is really the size of a plunge pool. There is a gym although the steam room/jacuzzi where out of action when we were there. Breakfast was very good, plenty of selection in the spacious restaurant area to the rear. The staff were lovely and very helpful in recommendations as to where to visit & as we celebrated a birthday, a bottle of sparkling wine was left in our room, which was a very kind gesture.

The rooms are beautiful and the recent renovation appears to have been carried out with the highest quality. Meanwhile, the service provided by the hotel was without a doubt among the best I've ever experienced. Management has clearly invested in training their staff, who are courteous, personable, always present, and willing to help at every juncture. Food at the restaurant was also outstanding.  The hotel is situated in a fantastic location for visitors. We'd gladly stay at Bairro Alto again.   The only suggestion for potential guests is to carefully select one's room, as the description of one of the rooms we stayed in really wasn't entirely accurate.  But this was rectified in a more than satisfactory manner and didn't mar the stay"

This hotel delivered incredibly bad service from start to finish. Of all the five star hotels at which i have stayed, this is literally the first hotel that compelled me to post a review  to trip advisor.  Every comment I make is 100% accurate.    First, I tried to book on the hotel website.  The prices listed for our two night stay were significantly different one night one and night two.  Yet, when I made the booking, the website increased the price to the higher level and charged it for both nights.   I called the hotel to ask why this was happening, and they said ""we have no idea.  Can you take photo of the website and e-mail"

I was celebrating my birthday and traveling solo but never felt alone - the management and staff were very warm and welcoming and went the extra step to make this trip memorable for me. The roof top terrace is definitely one of the coolest spots in town to enjoy a few drinks before heading out on the town or retiring for the evening. The Barrio Alto is conveniently located and easy to find after walking for hours all over Lisbon. My room was spacious , well appointed and spotless. The turn down service was a plus!!  Best of all - everyone remembered my name - way to make a girl feel right at home. Thanks to everyone at Barrio Alto for a truly fabulous week. See you soon. Belinda"

The hotel is located perfectly with access to the river, Baixa-Chiado metro, the shopping and dining areas you need as well as hundreds of restaurants. The food is amazing at the BAHR restaurant as well, and the view towards the river is sublime.The rooms are small, but well decorated, maybe a little too many small pieces of furniture as sometimes you have to move things to get to the window.

The TV had loads of channels but most in Portuguese but you just need to scroll to find English channels.  Breakfast wasn’t included in my room rate but at €12 it was excellent value.

Miguel was especially so accommodating to our needs. Originally we had a very small room, and we asked him if we could get a bigger room and he was able to make that happen. The room was at the top floor and had an AMAZING view. The room was also nicely decorated, very cozy.  Also, when I needed to print out some documents for travel, the front desk staff let me use their computers to do so. Everyone who worked there were amazing. The bar also had really good drinks and there was outdoor seating. The hotel itself was in a GREAT location.

TV could not receive BBC or CNN or a few other international channels, but hey, in Lisbon, there are other things to do rather than watch TV right!. Also, the door was EXTREMELY hard to open.

Very fresh rooms, and especial the bath, with a lot of toys, plenty of details and decorations. But not so big...at all. High standard on everything though. Very good location, but on a very touristic street but a few streets away it calms down. And thank god for that. Plenty of really good places to eat and drink just in the local neighborhood. Breakfast was decent and staff quick responsive and helpful. Have tried a few Browns and this is at the top. Recomended and may return."

It’s nowhere near four star quality, starting from some of the rudest front desk folks I’ve encountered. After four nights there and checking out, the only thing the front desk woman said to me was “eight euros” which is how much I owed in hotel fees apparently.  Even though it was 70 degrees out, they still ran the heat all day which meant I had to open the window at night and listen to noisy streets. I was told to deal with it by front desk and they don’t provide fans to guests and won’t change the central heat.

Near many attractions! I found it very easy to walk to places I needed to go to. I felt safe traveling solo and staying here. The hotel itself is really cute. Great decor and cleanliness. Staff is friendly and helpful. The only two negative things but minor, was that part of the lobby is under construction and there is a smell of paint in the lobby and you had to go outside or around a different way to get to the breakfast area. Also the hallways that lead to the rooms are very dimly lit and dark. There are auto sensors for the lights to turn on and sometimes there is a slight delay and you can’t really see too well in the hallways. It can be a little bit spooky if you are a female"

When you arrive at the hotel you are received incredibly well. People help with the bag and you get a lot of info at the reception about everything that is in the hotel. That's about where the good service ends. Then it went downhill fast. The room has no sound insulation at all and you can hear both neighbors and people outside. So if you are easy to wake up, you will wake up. It can certainly be different from room to room.  I had plans to celebrate my birthday at the hotel. My plan was to order some sparkling wine for the room but I got info that it would be included because Its my birthday. I thought this sounded great so I did not order anything. Once my birthday was over, I got nothing. Not even a congratulatory card. I went down to the"

I stayed stayed here with my mother before leaving for a Viking river cruise for my Mom's 75th in March 2019-before the world turned upside down. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed and the rooftop bar was great! I imagine it's even more spectacular with the recent renovations. We especially enjoyed having cocktails at the Lobby Bar. If Samuel, Ruben or Volodymyr are still bartending at the Lobby Bar, you will enjoy the drinks they prepare and  conversing with them. If not, you will still enjoy the laid back, yet elegant ambience. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, it's worth it to have a cocktail in the lobby or rooftop bar."

Tivoli is without a doubt upscale but I found the Intercontinental rooms equal to Tivoli and it’s location across from the park offers pleasant views. Tivoli has an outstanding breakfast and is priced accordingly. The room was smaller than at two other hotels, with some evident minor wear and tear on the furnishings. Given the cost I know we’ll stay at another hotel we enjoy on our next visit. Each to his own."

I was warmly and efficiently greeted by the Front Office Manager and found the guest service and valet receptionists to be quite friendly and efficient. The house keeping, on the other hand, was borderline rude and dismissive and would remind us that they were working on fixed schedules should we request anything out of the textbook.  The rooms are spacious and fairly comfortable, though the signs of wear and tear were noticeable and the hotel could probably use some renovations.

The location was great, the staff friendly and the breakfast was very good. The gym was also very well kitted out.   However, I feel that perhaps it was overpriced. The rooms were okay although there wasn't much ventilation in the bathroom. It didn't give off a premium feeling despite it being a 5 star.   There is a sky bar and unfortunately you can hear it in your room. If you are a light sleeper it might be a problem. Also, we ordered some extra pillows multiple times but they never came which was disappointing.  So whilst overall this is a good hotel, I am not sure if it worthy of being considered luxury."

The room had a bizar design with a very bad desk (made for very small people) in a dead corner, terrible lighting, leaking bathroom and sounds from the neighbours next door. The collection of bric and brac furniture is silly and looks cheap. Cleaning was not OK, background music a cheap playlist and the coffee was terrible.

The taxi dropped me at the hotel, it was around 11:40pm.

I'll start by saying that we had an excellent experience in Porto. The room was clean, comfortable, and the staff provided great customer service. Both hotels were in optimal locations close to public transportation.  Unfortunately, the experience in Lisbon was far from ideal. The main issue was the hotel staff's lack of concern/sympathy for the concerns we brought up during our stay.

Outside is deceiving because from the main road, it's literally a wood door and on either side is a shoe shop lol.

If you want chain hotel Holiday Inn with a giant front lobby then stay at one.  The Tesouro is clean, well kept, has a quirky charm (decorated with retro household items here and there).  Staff is all very friendly and helpful.

Room was great, lovely big 'memory foam' bed, marble bathroom, mini--bar (not that we used it!), mega TV with good selection of channels inc CNN, BBC, etc. So far so good!  Went down for breakfast and the service was next to non-existent. My wife had to call someone over to get tea, which came but without milk so she asked for milk which came in a large jug and was poured for her (and too much but what do you do with the excess?). At the same time the person never bothered to ask me if I would like a hot drink!!!! (I don't in fact drink tea or coffee  but service it was not).   There were plenty of staff in the restaurant but standing in groups of 3 around the dumb waiters and even those that were 'cruising' tables didn't seem to know"

Took 10 hours for the third bed to arrive for our five year old son to sleep in. We had been awake since 3am and it arrived after 2100 in spite of four  requests and first requesting it at 1045  Breakfast was a complete shambles every single morning  . Loads of staff with attitude but no leadership or orange juice or plates or glasses  or basic Supplies for a hot breakfast such as beans. No logical system for restocking buffet.  Asked for fresh milk as I don't like UHT to be told by a Manager that they don't stock it   Room service was unbelievable and the phone rang out so you have to go down in the elevator to order which defeats the purpose. Concierge arranged a taxi which costs us double the return journey .  Face

Breakfast is a disorganised mess, AC doesn’t work in the room because the hotel somehow feels that 21 C is an acceptable temperature for a room , housekeeping is a nightmare and even when you tell the hotel you are out and about at 9am in the morning and if housekeeping can please clean the room before 3pm they of course are cleaning the room at 5.30pm when you just come back. Forget about calling the front desk because no-one will answer the phone and when you complain no solutions and lame I am sorry sir. Nothing works at this hotel and it is a far cry from a 5 star hotel at best a 4 star based on amenities but based on how the hotel is operating and managed a three star is closer to the truth. We have decided not to stay"

First, if you are a tourist and want to explore Lisbon it is very far from the city center.  You cannot walk to the best parts of the city. The first day there we  had washcloths- never to be seen again (fortunately years of travel has taught me to bring my own). First day of included breakfast buffet it took 10 minutes to flag down a waitress for  coffee and then it came with attitude. I left the empty tissue box on the sink so the housekeeper could see it needed to be replaced. She put the empty box back on the shelf. There was never any shower gel or coffee creamer in the room.

We utilised the Spa pool which was ok, however clearly not looked after to the level you would expect.  Very few towels on beds, some rules regarding swimming caps for us but then nobody else seemed to either need to wear them or were ""sold"" them.

We were greeted warmly by check in staff and check in was relatively quick despite all COVID procedures.  The hotel is very conveniently located - we used the Jardim Zoologico metro station which is a 3-5 minute walk from the hotel every day to get to central Lisbon via the metro (via the Blue Line, Linha Azul) and we used the Sete Rios train station to get to Sintra and Cascais on a few occasions which is located right above the metro station. This makes transport to central Lisbon extremely easy and it avoids you having to pay ridiculous prices for taxis. The hotel itself is a very modern and clean building.

I did try to go to the pool but felt there were too many unmasked people and not enough ventilation. So, the spa took me a little early for my treatment. It was the most personalized treatment I’ve received yet. Not just what she (Andrea) asked of me but the fact that she listened and adjusted everything perfectly.  My stay was wonderful!

Reduced number of the employees, the lady from reception who will help for the bags (that s crazy) , not the same fabulous breakfast that we used to it, not the welcome kit in the rooms with sweets and fruits , they opened the bed only for night of our arrival and the night after no service, so far not the same service level as the past years but we paid"

It's just that it promised so much more than it provided, and let itself down in little ways that really could have been avoided.

No. Could we get her room service brought up? No. But we COULD listen to the private party's music in our room for the rest of the night. The next afternoon they had ticketed dinner/show events in the bar area, so once again it was of limits. We were also told that only the first Nespresso in the room would be free, although this may have been a miscommunication. Other disappointments were the room being small, and almost devoid of any"

My wife fell ill after we checked out (nothing to do with the hotel) and we returned back to the hotel. The staff could not have been any kinder.   They wanted to get the doctor and even offered to go to the pharmacy to buy the medicine.We felt that this was beyond any call of duty by the staff. Well done and keep up the good work! We were even given complementary water and a coffee while my wife was recovering  and we were waiting for the taxi to take us to the airport."

I was intrigued by the room features which led me to book the hotel.  I am so glad I did!  The room knocked me over -- hi tech, quiet, fun toilet and shower arrangements, secure.  The service was 100% every time I encountered an employee -- check-in, dining, housekeeping, and check-out.  The food was superior -- delicious, well presented -- and the ordering system simplified the whole eating out process.  Again, a hi-tech approach won the day!  My plans called for flying from Lisbon back to the U.S.  I was concerned about access to the Metro and the location of a pharmacy for a COVID test.  When I walked out the front door - BOOM! - a pharmacy was next to the Metro entrance right outside the door.  My stay couldn't have"

The impact is that there are fewer, tourist-oriented restaurants, but more locally-oriented services, such as grocery stores, and small snack bars. If you are planning to tour the historic areas, leave time and budget to take the Metro (in front of the hotel) or Uber.  The staff was very-friendly and helpful - we were there at the time of the Corona Virus restrictions, and received (food) recommendations and friendly conversation. The bartender provided us wine glasses and a corkscrew for our stay, when she saw that we had bought a bottle to enjoy in our room.  The hotel is extremely modern. The lobby, with bar, is beautiful.

That’s not true, it is a 25 minute bus ride to the old town.   Second, the room was awful The shower and the toilet are in strange looking plastic tubes in the middle of the room. This means that there is absolutely no privacy! The bottom of the tube is opaque, but the top is not, and the plastic is so thin that there is no noise disguising at all – it is as if the toilet is basically sitting right next to the bed. So much for a romantic getaway. And if you want to wash your hands after using the toilet you have to walk around the corner to the sink at the other side of the room. Plus, both the shower and the toilet are tiny, so small that if you sit on the toilet your knees bump into the wall of the strange"

Even being married for years I would not use these where my husband could see and hear everything. Neither would he and he went down to reception which were no better. Everyone looking at everyone else.So embarassing. The mirror was placed so the person in bed had a perfect view of the person in the pod.. on the potty..No hiding from it. Nowhere to hang towels. The automated systems were all wired up wrong so if you wanted to turn on a nightlight in the dark, The tv came on..blinds started going up and down..showers turned on..and all hell broke loose!

The hotel is extremely modern and funky. The room size was ok. There was a toilet and shower area with a privacy curtain. See photos. The bed was a little firm for my liking but to air conditioning was almost silent but kept the room at a pleasant temperature. There were electric blackout blinds that really worked well.   Breakfast was excellent with a really good selection of pastries including some local ones. There was the typical fruit cereals yoghurts and continental selection of cheeses and meats but a good range and high quality. Cooked food was also great. The only challenge was the coffee/tea machine. Although excellent as it was a fresh bean/grind machine which meant it was a little slow so allow time.   The staff were all extremely helpful

I was surprised not too hear too much street traffic either, wasn’t silent but not bad at all. The issues came at bedtime... while the exterior walls were sound proof the interior were not and heard our neighbors all night at a lovely 9:30am wake up call by housekeeping hovering (clearly too early to Hoover in a hotel on a Sunday....) Additionally the AC just wouldn’t cool down the room. After a few night of restless sleep due to the heat (room wouldn’t drop below 24* and opening window wasn’t option because it opened about an inch and allowed to breeze in at all) we notified the front desk in the morning and they said they would send someone to look.

Location is good as many others state but you need to be closer in to the centre if you don't like walking, or be prepared to use the buses a lot. Not so good points - not the most spacious room, lack of storage space for clothes and bedroom was too warm for us. Hotel wouldn't turn the air con on as they said it was winter and the majority of travellers were heating their rooms according to their computer. The fact that the temperature was between 21 degrees and 26 degrees outside didn't matter. You could open the windows a little but not enough, and the road outside is very busy so from 6.00am onwards it was noisy.  Not a bad"

The breakfast is free and it is very good start for the day.  Had only bit problem with the WiFi in my room but I think it's because my room was on the corner,  other places in the hotel it worked good. All together I like this hotel."

Our usual hotel had jacked up the prices, so we looked elsewhere and discovered this hotel. It still a walkable distance from 'our favourite restaurant,'O Saboroso', and the 'Clatter Factor' ( how much noise the breakfast staff make with the crockery and cutlery) is very low compared to our usual hotel further north towards Parque station.  The reception staff are amazing, especially the Girlie who worked the Bar in the late evening. Their English is very good; they could even communicate with a party of 60 + Scousers who were on a school trip."

I have to publicly recognize Adrian who one night warmed our dinner and served it on a plate with utensils. Also, since we checked our early, the front desk had a to go breakfast for us. Lastly, you can’t beat the price. I paid less than $80 a night."

Breakfast was excellent with a really good choice - including a machine that made pancakes and also the famous Portuguese custard tarts! Yummy.

What a charm!  Of course you have to like history and go with flow attitude. There are many sites to visit and many things to do but you have to be patient with locals and tourists. There are lines everywhere.  Our hotel was a little bit out off the Centro Histórico. Right in the heart of all the designer’s shops. Simple hotel ( with breakfast included! I am not a breakfast eater but it help if you are watching your budget). Room was small but clean. Staff was very friendly.  I love the Tuk Tuk experience. It is price. Different companies and different prices. Started at 50 Euros.  In Europeans countries problem is everything was closed from Dec 24 around 6 pm to Dec26!  Even the main attractions and restaurants!

There were a lot of upmarket shops around and a Pingo Doce market about 400 metres around the corner. Bus stops were in the vicinity and there was airport transfer to drop us off 5 minutes from the hotel. We purchased a Viva Viagem card and topped it up with a 24 hour credit that we used on the buses, metro and trams. To top up the card after 24 hours, the best option is to find a local store displaying a ""Payshop"" icon or a metro station with a manned ticket counter"

Although some of the brand new properties are quite nice, this one isn't.. Pretty much everything was as expected, can't really  complain, but can't say it was something special either.  I already stayed here 2.5 years ago so my expectations were not high especially because at this time  I paid 99% more and I feel that a 86€ rate per night for one person is far too much. I would have chosen another hotel for a better price, only if I could."

Our package included breakfast, so we went down for breakfast daily.  We stayed 4 nights but the menu was EXACTLY the same during the entire stay."

It is also very near both the trolley and bus stops and an easy walk to the train station to catch the train to Cascais (40 minute ride and a  must visit town). It is also surrounded by shops and restaurants and just a few steps to the pedestrian-only streets leading to the river, just through the old arch. It's an easy walk to Lisbon's ""Champs Elysee"" as well, so it's really a perfect location for people watching, exploring and dining. We were upgraded to a larger room, a mini-suite of sorts, for no extra charge  during our week's stay. Even so, the room was small as was the bathroom. That said, it was very clean, very modern and fine as we were really only there for sleeping, and sleeping was great, the"

Hotel Tejo turned out to be even better that we had hoped. Our group was on two floors and could easily communicate for group work.

We stayed put as in terms of space these were better but no balcony and the rooms are we had were right outside the lifts so we could hear people arriving and leaving the floor.  In terms of not being 5 * they’re were lots of little issues. Threadbare towels, dressing gown with broken loops, room not cleaned until 5pm. Dirty pool towels not taken.

The lobby of the hotel and the hallways which were very dark seemed to feel a bit outdated.  While the hotel was nice I had a good stay, I wouldn't necessarily consider it 5 star....in cities like New York or London it would be closer to a 3.5-4.

Well positioned just next to Anjos Metro Station a couple of stops from everywhere, or brief walk to the centre. Only drawback was our room was on the ground floor next to lift shaft, although we couldn't hear the lift there were people who would occasionally be a bit noisy while they waited for it.

Chapter 2:  Hotel Travel Park (for Chapter 1 go to my review of the HF Porto Tuela, Porto)  We stayed at the Travel Park as part of a package vacation offered by Air Canada Rouge.  This is rated as a 3 Star hotel but in comparison to the Porto Tuela it is definitely at the lower end of the 3 star rating.  To be fair if we had not stayed at the Tuela first I probably would not have been as dissatisfied as I am.    The rooms are very dated. We had a twin room but because of the size of the room the beds were pushed together.  We had a street side room and it was really noisy.  The bathroom was dated and it was impossible to take a shower without flooding the bathroom.  The beds were reasonably comfortable.  What really differentiated this 3 star from the"

While none of the issues ruined my stay, combined they caused me to issue an average rating.  It started when I checked in - they said I did not have a reservation for me.  After investigating, they said that hotels.com was at fault and that they had only 1 room left. The bathroom had what looked like mold in the tub(see the picture), the clothes line did not work, the a/c was hit or miss, and the safe did not work. The shower head was broken but they fixed that after we reported it.   Other reviews say this is in a good location, but I disagree. It is very close to the Anjos metro stop, but all the good sights require a long walk or taking the metro. The surrounding area is not what I would call"

The pool was an infinity pool which was lovely. It was a bit of a walk to the main bar area (Bairro Alto), ~ 20 min but it was nice and warm out, and we are active so we didn't mind at all."

Try Chu Chu round the corner for the most extensive wine menu I’ve ever seen! Room was on 4th floor and was a good size and comfortable.  Had a couple of excellent gin and tonics in the small cosy bar.  The star of the show undoubtedly was the breakfast which was great for filling up before a days walking and climbing Would definitely return if we come back to Lisbon

Only decent choices were the cold selection of hams, cheeses and chorizos. Pastries were ok at best. * Coffee was served via coffee machine, not fresh considering I would expect fresh coffee being in Portugal * No double glazing windows - very noisy downstairs.

While a bit removed from the old city and waterfront areas it was not an undoable walk and the area does feature good shopping opportunities and a number of good restaurants and drinking establishments. Our room was quite comfortable and well appointed. The included daily breakfast was much appreciated. Not spectacular but a good variety and well attended. We frequented the small bar off the lobby. The bar manager was super friendly and a wealth of information on where to eat, what to see and how to get around. Very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend this facility, especially to English speaking tourists."

So what, one would say? Unfortunately my stay (4 nights) was spoiled by my room position (at the center of a corridor) and the defects of construction of the hotel (renovated not too recently but still in good shape). It was simply impossible to sleep (and if you're on holiday you cannot get a rest in preparation of the following day, as you will wake up sleepless and already tired at 7am).

The hotel was 100m from Roma metro station, about 15 minutes into the city centre.

The reception staff were helpful and friendly whenever we saw them and the double room we booked was very comfortable and exceptionally well cleaned every day. The room was at the back of the hotel with a balcony providing great views across the city. Breakfast was varied and plentiful and the staff were friendly. The hotel is very near to all of the tourist areas but based in an old residential area with lots of places to eat cheaply as well as some upmarket restaurants. It is a culturally diverse area with interesting shops and cafes, with a buzz of local life. It is easy to get around the city from here on trams and buses as well as"

We arrived at 3 in the afternoon and found the door locked!  It was my understanding that they had a 24 hr front desk.  We were a little taken back and were unsure what we should do when someone did show up and unlock the door.  Turned out there is only 1 staff member at that time and they needed to use the facilities so lock the door.  That's totally understandable but perhaps put a small note on the door advising that you will be right back. The room was very clean and tidy with a laminate floor and modern furnishings.  It was small but that is to be expected.  The linens and towels were very good. There was a kettle in the room but no coffee or tea bags and a fridge.  Our room was at the back on a higher floor and we had a great view.  Location is

Quite small bathroom but didn’t bother us shower was lovely. Tv has a few English Channels but also fine for us. Bed comfortable.  It’s based in the anjos area when booking on booking.com it sounded more like Alfama it isn’t. Metro station literally a 2 minute walk away (interdente) really good metro lines here can get to places so easy and cheap. But easy enough to walk too first day we walked 5 miles around the castle and Alfama, baixa, Rossio Etc just bare in mind it’s quite hilly here and a big city. Anjos area is fine id read reviews about it being perhaps a rougher area but we didn’t think so really. Can hear lots of sirens but it is a city. Lots of restaurants"

The hotel was very modern and the staffs were very friendly.  The room and the bathroom were little small but were well designed and equipped. It seemed like a new hotel.

It’s conveniently located within walking distance of key places. The staff are helpful and do their best to make your stay a memorable one and are quick fix issues. Big shout out to Ines who works in the afternoon. Breakfast is at the bistro down the street and in typical European style doesn’t start until 8am. It’s basic and what you’d expect from 3 star but if you don’t eat meat be prepared for a lot of pastries. The rooms are spacious, well equipped and comfortable even if the walls are thin (bring ear plugs). I sleep in cold rooms, so put the air conditioning on and woke up two hours later in a sauna, only to be told that in October it is set to winter mode meaning that even if the temperature is set to cold it will heat the room! No signs to say"

Our rooms were well taken care off each day, and the staff made several recommendations and reserved a table for us at a local Fado restaurant.  We appreciated the complementary water in the lobby and the espresso machine in the room.  The hotel is centrally located so you can walk everywhere.  It is also just steps from the metro.  Would stay here again."

Excellent location close to restaurants and shopping. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable with modern features even though the building is old.They provide a very good buffet breakfast. One thing to watch. We ordered a taxi to take us to the airport. Specifically said TAXI not a limo. Despite that they booked us a limo who charged twice the price of a regular cab. We had no choice but to take it because we needed to get to the airport. Grrrr!

Breakfast is served in Browns Bistro just round the corner but the food was excellent.. The location is excellent for sightseeing as it is only one street away from Rue de Augusta. We would go back any time."

So surprising and the attention to detail in the decor was much appreciated. Stayed in a superior room on the first floor, appreciated the coffee machine in the room and the complimentary bottle of wine. My room was a good size. One recommendation would be some sheer curtains for the lower rooms. It was hard to open the curtains and appreciate the sunlight when looking straight into the offices across the street. I can’t wait to come back and stay again - would request a room on a higher floor though."

The rooms are smaller than they appear on the website and the walls very thin. I don’t think I slept much.   There is no hotel bar where one might have a nightcap (one might have concluded there was from the photos) a vending machine has replaced it.  I was also miffed to see the stated rate wasn’t the actual rate! They charge a tourist tax on top. This should be included in their quotes. I don’t favour establishments that mislead. Overall little to recommend it. I’d pay a smidge more and get something else if you care about sleeping."

My flight was cancelled due to coronavirus, and I planned to stay a second night and made the reservation directly at the hotel. My next flight was cancelled as well and I had to leave the hotel at 9am and told the manager that I did an earlier checkout because we would try to leave the country by other means. We therefore left the hotel at 9am and did not make use of the second night, even though informing in advance.. The hotel refused to refund the money of the second night. A behaviour that is not understandable in the current times where all airlines, hotels and intermediates refund tourists."

The morning buffet was delicious and excellent. The hotel is located close to the city, with plenty of restaurants nearby. The Lisbon Oceanarium is located within a 10 to 15 minute drive from the hotel. We had a great time here, spending most of our days travelling and arriving in the late evenings to what felt just like home. They have great facilities, providing tired tourists with elevator service that takes you to your floor where you’ll find your room so that you don’t have to use the stairs. The breakfast area has a balcony which shows a beautiful view of the surrounding area. Also close to the hotel is the Alameda da Encarnação. Highly recommended."

Do your homework before deciding if this property is right for you. It seems it's best for budget sensitive backpacking guests who don't need many comforts or services and don't mind an area with few options for dining, drinks or entertainment in the immediate area."

The room was clean, but small. There is not much in the area. There are 2 local restaurants that are decent and reasonably priced. The Alameda metro station is about a kilometer away, BUT it is down a very steep hill, so after sightseeing all day it is quite a trudge back up. The best thing about this hotel is the amazing staff. Every one of them was very pleasant, extremely helpful, very caring and all spoke excellent English. They are very happy to help with arranging tours, making recommendations and giving directions. It's good value for the money, but a little out of the way."

The other station is Olias which is a reasonable walk. If this is your first time to Lisbon you might want to stay a bit closer to the action. While the metro is a good price and convenient with the heat of the day I would have wanted the option to have a break at the hotel. This wasn’t the case for hotel DAH.  The hotel itself is quiet and clean and the housekeeping staff are simply amazing. The reception staff are friendly and spoke good English, but could have been more knowledgable about tours and activities. There is a small lift available.  The rooms are big"

It was spotless with the amenities you would expect. The room was configured in such a way that the two beds were separated somewhat for a bit of privacy. The bath is modern and it has a great shower. Our room had a nice balcony. The view was not spectacular but having the breeze was enjoyable. Breakfast is typical European style -- hot eggs and meat, assorted cold cuts and cheeses, breads and croissants, fruit, cereal, etc. The staff was extremely helpful over the phone and in person. Recommended."

The room was clean and organized; the folks at the front desk were super friendly answering all our questions and giving us directions about places, etc. There is a parking lot available for a modest extra fee and the breakfast was good and well presented. There is also a lookout where you can combine coffee with a beautiful view. The metro station is really close, about 5 minutes walking.  I think it’s a safe area because we walk late at night and there were people walking along us. I would stay again if I have the opportunity."

Front desk folks were extremely helpful, answering all questions and in one case going above and beyond to make a phone call on our behalf to straighten out a computer glitch with our toll pass.

The triple room was indeed spacious and we all slept extremely well despite it being on a main road-we are very light sleepers. The beds were very comfortable. It’s possible that a double room with an extra bed would have been enough and at that price, £78, it would have been incredibly good value for Lisbon. The room was very clean and it had a balcony where we could enjoy a beer after our child had gone up bed.  The breakfast room is quite small - there is also an outdoor part which has some ok views over Lisbon... you can see the river. The food selection was good: coffee and pastries were good but the croissants looked very dry.  Location was good although it is an uphill trek from"

The hotel is near to the metro station. The front office agents (Horácio, Ana, Andreina, Susana and Cyndna) were so friendly, hospitable and attended to our needs. We left the hotel at 4:00 a.m. for our flight and Horácio helped us with the luggages and followed up on the transport service. He was very professional. Though this is not a five-star hotel, the front office agents have rendered a five-star service and we would highly recommend it to other tourists. We would definitely stay there again should we visit Lisbon in the future."

Easy to reach from the airport, good metro links to get around the city. Breakfast on the terrace is a pleasure in warm weather.   For those arriving from the airport however be aware it is at the top of a steep hill, so make sure you are able to carry your bags the final 500-600 metres."

This is a clean and comfortable hotel with great transport links to the city. The Metro station is a 10 minute walk down the hill (wasn't a problem for us but could potentially be a struggle). The Metro was quick and very easy to use. A further 10 minutes from the hotel you can find a few restaurants and bars if you wanted to stay closer to the hotel in the evening, which were also much cheaper. Good for a place to crash after a busy day exploring."

The website we booked at gave us a twin room but we were offered a swap to a double for the next night which was very nice. The hotel is very reasonable priced and definitely worth it. It is not located close to the city but there are 2 metro stops very close to the hotel so it is easy to travel in to explore. Would recommend this place if you are just looking for a bed for the night so you can explore in the day."

A few minutes walk and you are right on the subway and on your way to wherever your heart desires.  The room was a delight and offered a lovely vista especially in the breakfast area! Speaking of breakfast, the staff member was always on hand with yet another goodie to add to the already huge selection but still managed not to get underfoot when clients were enjoying the morning meal.  All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel and would return again myself if ever I visit Lisbon again."

The staff was downright rude and we had to ask for our deposit back even after we handed in our keys. Being polite goes a long way. It’s alright, but definitely not for a extended period of time. The bathrooms were horrid. 2 toilets on the entire floor one for men and one for women. It does have a really good location. Essentially you get what you pay for but my friends and I would probably not stay here again. It’s not bad but like I said, you get what you pay for and personally I think the staff could be nicer and it could be cleaner!!"

While the building is a great 1920s building, with a beautiful original lift, the hostel ruined completely the ambiance filling everything with cheap boards painted in screaming colours, giving it the looks of a 1990s cheap motel.  The ""rooms"" - in fact, it's a large room divided with thin boards - are very small, and air renovation is very difficult. The boards not only pass all the noise being made on the joining rooms, but they even amplify it. In two nights I've got two school groups in the adjoining rooms, which made incredible noise into the night. At some point, I had to go to the reception 4.50 in the morning to ask them to do something.   There is only 1 WC per floor, often broken. The showers on my floor were also broken most"

What i liked the most was the excellent location, at walking distance of every main attraction on bail chide, we even did the walk towards the castello st jorge on foot. The staff is very friendly and they even offer us free storage when we did th check out. Plus, the included breakfast is great, basic but fresh and healthy. Great place for younger travelers."

A bargain by any standards for a central location in a major European city.  The taxi from the Airport was a short journey and cost €25 for the four of us. Our hotel was situated on Avenida Almirante Reiss and I would have to say was a disappointment on first sight not looking at all as glamorous from the outside as it had done on that most deceptive of devices – The Internet. However, on entering we were met by a much better interior and such friendly and helpful staff that our first impressions faded into oblivion.  Rooms are well sized, clean and comfortable with an enormous, extremely comfortable bed. The Breakfast area and small bar off the Lobby were"

Very clean and modern hotel with breakfast included. Not a huge range of breakfast options but bread/cheese/meats, some hot food (eggs, sausages and tortilla) with fruit and little pastries.  Rooms were great, king size bed and shower/bath.  The line green line which serves Anjos metro station heads directly into the city centre and it getting to the airport was simple - about a 20 min tube ride with only one change.   Thoroughly recommend the hotel for a slightly cheaper option!"

But first of all we were met like this: 'move your car out of the entrance!' We were shocked, to hear that after the long day of our journey. Especially as we have read on their website that they provide parking: 'private parking with extra payment' / or 'openair parking'. BEWARE, all this is a lie. And your journey will end in the busy road, and receptionist behaving with you like with a hobo, just because you have asked her, where to find any parking!? It was told to us that they are overbooked and it is not their problem that we do have a car!!! It made us loose time, searching for a parking and feel absolutely unwanted clients. Sincerely do not recommend, if you want to sustain calmness"

The rooms are basic, the shower is in the bath (I don't think you would have a bath), there is a bar fridge but nothing in it but our room with a balcony was a reasonable size... we didn't use the balcony but it allowed us to open the windows....breakfast very simple, nothing special ... our first impression was that the room not that clean but this seemed to improve as we stayed longer, we had to remember this was only a 3 star hotel but represented reasonable value."

No bar or restaurant for food/ drinks at night but shops close by and the metro for everything else. Definitely recommend"

Everything else about it made up for this with the best location - close to the action but a street away meant no late night street noise; the best staff from the helpful receptionists to the restaurant waiters serving what I thought was great food. Not sure why breakfast has been criticised - I couldn’t see anything wrong with it. Loved sitting in the outside section in the evening watching the world go by - with overhead heaters! Our flight was cancelled and the receptionists couldn’t have been more helpful with helping book a train. Altogether a really good option and I would certainly go back. Oh a really comfortable beds too. What’s not to like!

It exceeded my expectations y even providing a make-up mirror which does not often happen in hotels. The soothing decor, wonderful breakfast and friendly/helpful staff made my stay so comfortable and fun. Two recommendations if you book: The main street is like an echo chamber so even the smallest conversation outside filters into your room. If you are a light sleeper, best to book in the courtyard side. Secondly, they charge 15 euros for room service which is really excessive considering my average meal is Lisbon was round 20 euros.

The location is perfect. You can go with the bike, step, by foot or Uber everwhere super quick. And iT is a Nice neighbourhood. However that is about iT what makes this a Nice hotel. The room we stayed in was very very small. Just enough space for a bed. But we did not know where to put our bags. This is not really a problem as we did not spend much time in the room. But still for the price we payed we expected more. The bathRoom was Nice. And the reception is not very helpfull. If you want to find the Nice places to eat better check TripAdvisor then ask at the front desk.   Would try a different hotel next time. Just because did not get a Nice warm welcome feeling.
