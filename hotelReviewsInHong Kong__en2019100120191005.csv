0,"We had a 3 night stay at Hotel VIC with the Club VIC add on. This was amazing and the experience made us feel very special. We had a room on the 22nd floor with a fantastic view of Victoria Harbour with all the lights and boats. Club VIC and the staff there was amazing. With a gorgeous breakfast and a 2 hours of cocktail hour every evening, we found that this was the best place to be in Hong Kong. The staff gave us a fantastic customer experience with the beautiful people in Hong Kong that go the extra mile to make your holiday fabulous. I would thoroughly recommend this Hotel and their Club VIC experience and would not even contemplate staying anywhere else on my next visit. ","July 12, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

1,"I booked a “Premium Harbour View Room” which had a great view of Victoria Harbour. The room itself was very comfortable and modern but a little smaller than I am used to enjoying on my travels. The hotel is fairly new and has a small shopping complex below it. The hotel lobby has to be accessed by the lift as its not located on the ground floor. The hotel pool is beautiful with great views of the harbour. The gym is also well equipped. The MTR station is across the road from the hotel with bus and tram stops also within walking distance. There are plenty of restaurants, eateries and 7-elevens within walking distance. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would return again.","July 12, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

3,Booked straight off a website and very happy with our choice. Rooms are not huge but modern and very comfortable. Free bottled water on a daily basis is a nice touch. Farmhouse Staff could do with a bit more training on how to greet guests and help when needed. Should be noted concierge on desk at reception is fantastic super helpful. Staff at cruise bar are also lovely and very helpful. The hotel itself is modern and free shuttle to central and causeway bay is a great help. For those not wanting to stay in Kowloon this is a great choice. ,"July 7, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

9,Great location close to train and all transport. All restaurants & the rooftop bar excellent. We had a club Vic room which we loved having a drink before dinner each night in the club room. All staff throughout were excellent but Katy in Club Vic who checked us in and gave us important local information made our stay exceptional. Her friendly and helpful service is a huge asset to the hotel. Also Sharon organised our smooth checkout.

Modern, clean, great service from all the Club Vic staff, very helpful. Good breakfast, afternoon tea, evening drinks & canapés made for a very comfortable stay. Easy access transport.

15,The hotel has been operating for less than a year. Staff were very helpful and friendly which made our stay very enjoyable. The facilities are very new.Whilst the rooms were quite small they worked really well for two people. We stayed in the urban harbour view on level 22 (Club Vic). The extra $ was worth every cent for the Club Vic. The location was not very central however the mtr was so close and the trams which were super easy to take to central and wan chai districts. ,"June 21, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

17,"I had a harbour view room at club floor. With it comes buffet breakfast at the 22F club room (not as expansive selection if I had it downstairs but luxury of having it in relative peace and quiet while marvelling at Victoria Harbour view), afternoon tea and evening cocktails. Pool and Gym at 23F are a delight, not all HK hotels have these. Food at outlets (Cruise and Farm House) are innovative but still have comfort food feels and taste) - I love the pineapple with lime chili sauce. Only drawback for me - there’s only 1 English station on TV (CNBC).","June 16, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

30,"We stayed here for two days. The property is great in terms of amenities and infrastructure. Everything was first class. However, they are zero in hospitality. The experience starts with an additional breakfast charge for my son. None of the hotels I have visited till date have charged like this, not even we were just dinning guest and not a stying guest. Initially, I thought this might be common for Hong Kong but that is not the case either. The second shocker was 1500 dollar as deposit... most of the hotels take a deposit but they take ur credit card details and authorization but never debit the money at the beginning. This guy debited money and at end refund it. So virtually you have to pay twice for the international transaction on ur credit card. The final shocker was checking out. I have requested for late checkout by two hr but there was a big NO. ( in spite of the fact that I have checked in almost at night). After repeated request, they have given 1hr extension but when we tried to enter our room after 12:00 PM checking out time, the door was locked. Again request has to be made to open the door and get our luggage. The only two guys I remember having some sense of hospitality were Joy ( at the transport desk) and the guy who was sitting at the Concierge desk. Overall as I said, fantastic amenities without human touch...For me, a human touch is much more important than anything else.....","May 20, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

Check-in staff were fantastic - very friendly and helpful. We arrived very early and they made it easy to use the pool for the morning before the room was ready. Pool is on 23rd floor, open views across harbour - stunning. Gym was very well equipped - also on top floor. Cruise bar on top of West tower is also great.

We had access to the Executive lounge which was the best we have ever used. Breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapes with wine, beer and spirits were all top quality. The hot and cold selection of canapes every evening were plentiful and varied and changed each day. The wines were first rate too but the best thing about the lounge were the staff who went out of their way to look after you and give you advice and recommendations.

35,"This is a relatively new hotel located in a good area. It has a mix of Hong Kong culture and western influences. The rooms are not huge but adequate for Hong Kong. They have a great rooftop pool but it is on the small side. We had a great harbour view room while only paying for an urban view. Overall the hotel was a good deal and offered what we were looking for for a night. What I really wanted to speak about was that my wife lost her ring after breakfast. Actually, we were not aware that she had lost it yet but a staff member called our room to inquire if we lost a ring. Upon inspection, my wife did lose her wedding ring. A staff member found the ring and turned it in. The manager went to the videotape and did a CIS investigation to find out who the ring belonged to. In this day and age, you don't have this many honest people around you. I just have to say that this hotel has integrity and went out of their way to return something of both financial and sentimental value. That type of integrity and service goes a long way, more than a room with a view!I appreciate the staff members and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

41,"My partner and I had 7 nights at this new hotel. We normally stay at Holiday Inn Golden Mile on Nathan Road in Kowloon, but after being told about this new hotel by friends, we thought we would give it a try. Check in was quick and easy, our room was lovely but smallish (an Upper Premium Harbour View room), with a lovely harbour view. The breakfast buffet was good but I have had better - hash browns were cold every morning even though they were under a heat lamp and the skim milk jug not refilled once emptied. Had to ask for it to be refilled on 3 occasions so I could have skim milk with my cereal. And the Cereal was not refilled once the big bowls were empty either. Very annoying.... Good bar though with outside seating with a great harbour view. We didn't eat at the Hotel apart from breakfast, but the restaurants looked good. It's not in the prettiest of areas of Honkers, but it's right on the harbour front so that makes up for it, and not that far away from anywhere you want to be. MTR is in the block behind the hotel so nice and handy. Would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay a bit further out of the hussle and bussle of Honkers.","May 7, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

The interiors throughout are very tastefully decorated in a contemporary style with quality furnishings and materials - everything feels quality from the chaise lounge to the delightfully velvety bathrobes. The beds were very comfortable and sound proofing exceptional; we were pleasantly surprised not to hear any road noise from the Island Eastern Corridor Highway which passes in front of the hotel. The hotel gym on the roof of one of the towers is one of the better equipped gyms we've used in a big city hotel, and the rooftop infinity pool is to die for. It's not very big however, and we wonder how congested it might get in the peak of summer (we happened to stay over a rainy weekend so crowding wasn't a problem). Sauna/steam room also available on site. Views from the Cruise restaurant are spectacular again, but unfortunately we didn't get to sample the food as the venue was booked for a wedding the night we stayed. The all-day international dining restaurant FarmHouse on the 2/F where you'll enjoy your complimentary buffet breakfast has an acceptably broad variety of food, with the exception of the disappointingly limited selection of fruit considering we're in Asia. An area for improvement perhaps?Another area for improvement was the room service menu, where the selection was almost as limited as what one might expect on a plane, but perhaps with such a rich variety of great restaurants on offer in Hong Kong and the hotel located just three minutes walk from North Point MTR, the hotel assumes guests won't want to dine in.We'd heartily recommend this hotel and will very likely return for our next staycation.","May 5, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

44,"The room had views of the ever changing Victoria harbour that seems to be active day and night. Rooms and facilities are as advertised. Large rooms with bedding options. New hotel with uptodate easy to use technology. Easy 3 min access to North Point station with free shuttle covering most places. Multiple restaurants with places to sit and relax. Top floor gym and the pool adds value. All in all, our stay was very pleasant. If you venture out on your feet, be prepared to coe across the fish market and very busy market stalls. West wing rooms appear to be better than the east wing. Will stay again if we are stoping in Hong Kong.","May 4, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

46,"We stayed here for three days on our way back from Vietnam and quite enjoyed it. The location is very good, with the North Point station right near the hotel and the view over the harbour is lovely. The breakfast buffet was extensive, one of the best we have encountered in our travels and the rooms are well appointed, with a smart phone you can use to log into your google maps account and take with you when out and about exploring. The pool area was stunning, but unfortunately the water is ice-cold, making it less enjoyable than it should be. Our main gripe was the check in process, we had to queue for more than 40 minutes, and noticed that this was a daily occurrence for guests....it took us longer to check in to this hotel than it did to pass through immigration and customs! The staff member checking us in spent several solid minutes typing, perhaps whatever info staff need, could be collected prior to arrival to streamline the process? We were also given a room that was already occupied, so had to return to the front desk to sort that out...very embarrassing! .... Management did apologise for this, offering a late check out, but we already had this as part of our luxury escapes package and could not use it anyway, due to an early flight.","April 28, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

However the Hotel was well appointed with all the standard options of Restaurants, Gymnasium, Pool, Spa and Saunas. A number of Retail outlets occupied the Ground and 1st floors.Getting to the Hotel was not well signposted albeit close to the North Point MTR Station. The entry is also confusing as the lobby is not obvious being off to the side of the Main entry to the ground floor retails shops.Rooms were smaller than most ""western"" hotels but nonetheless comfortable with Minibar (Complimentary Basics) and small ensuite bathroom.

48,"New in 2018 this hotel has all the 5 star facilities, a great harbour outlook and all at a reasonable price. We took the harbour suite for our 4 nights and I would have happily stayed here for all 7 nights we spent in Hong Kong. Club access was a good benefit offering a low key breakfast but with everything you need. Snacks in the day and drinks 6-8 were also handy. The gym is a highlight and is what drew me in. Having a great view makes the workout so much more bearable. And the pool, steam rooms and saunas are on the same level, making for a great activity session. The area is indeed “local” but Causeway Bay is only a couple of metro stops away. There is a ferry stop at the front door. The Harbour North shopping plaza on the first 2 levels of the building was still getting established when we stayed in April 19. Though the full range of cosmetic stores are open for business. The metro is a short walk (past the municipal refuse facility). The city flyer airport bus (A11 and A12) stops 100m from the hotel and is my hot tip for travel to/from the airport. Cost HK$45. The upper deck provides a wonderful tour of Hong Kong. As with all of Hong Kong there are plenty of food options wherever you look near the hotel. Hotel staff were very eager to please and went the extra mile to help with anything we asked. They follow up with an email to confirm their recommendations, which was very useful. We ate at the Cruise restaurant which is very good. And the cheeseburger on the poolside dining menu was particularly good. ","April 25, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

The room is not big but you can see how the space is effectively used. The design and layout of the room is very user friendly. I like their hair dryer - unlike some hotels where a travel hair dryer is provided, this hotel provides a professional hair dryer and it dries my hair very quickly. It means it leaves me more time to enjoy my stay in HK and not have to worry about the hair. The room also features a complimentary minibar and a nestcafe expresso coffee machine. I also appreciate that they are not using giveaway travel bottles for the shower gels/shampoo as it does otherwise create a lot of plastic waste. Their gym is superb. You get a great view on the running machines. Also their 3D virtual machine is great fun. Staff at the gym was friendly and helpful. The sauna facility is very good.

52,"I have stayed at many hotels in Hong Kong when visiting with work but in my opinion this is the best. The hotel is new and finished to a high standard. The staff are all polite, efficient and keen to assist. The Club Vic is well worth the extra with a nice breakfast (don't expect a huge Chinese style buffet) , Afternoon tea and sandwiches and evening cocktails as well as drinks available throughout the day. The lounge is comfortable and a nice place to relax. The rooms are very well finished and thought out although ensure you request a room WITHOUT a connecting door. There is no sound insulation through the door and you lose all privacy. I raised this issue during the stay and the management are going to look into improving the sound proofing. That aside we had a lovely stay and all of the staff in the Club Vic lounge were very friendly and couldn't be more helpful. The location of the hotel is perfect in my view in that it is close to all public transportation (which is the best way to get around HK) and the views across to Kowloon are fantastic. The roof top bar at Cruise is a lovely place to sit and relax on a warm evening with a Mojito. So in summary 100% recommend the hotel and hope to return soon either privately or by suggesting that the hotel becomes a prefered hotel with the company I work with......","April 23, 2019","0    Hotel VIC on the Harbour

57,"We stayed here with my siblings during the 1st week of June. We stayed in one of the family rooms. The room was spacious, just enough for the 4 of us & 1 child. We were assigned in a room with a sea view at it was amazing. The amenities were sufficient to have a comfortable stay. There's a pool and a gym, wifi is fast, and breakfast was good. There's a salad & breads table, cereals and drinks table, and the the table with the main course & rice. Another favorite aspect of this hotel is its proximity to the Lido Beach. You just have to walk a few meters and you are in a clean, well-maintained beach with toilets and dressing rooms. The view in the beach are the two magnificent bridges that connect Hong Kong's Islands. The hotel is also just 5 mins walk from the Ting Kau bus terminal so you can go to & from the airport using the A31P bus for just 18 HKD. The staff were friendly and willing to assist us and they can speak understandable English. They also have free shuttle which transports guests to and from Tsuen Wan MRT station at regular intervals, making it easy to go to all tourist spots using the metro and also for buying supplies and food in Tsuen Wan. The hotel is located away from the busy city and offers nature views in its surroundings.My only suggestion is for the carpets to be replaced with new ones since they're already quite old. Tips: -Go to the Lido Cafe early for breakfast to avoid long lines.-Don't forget to bring plug adaptor for your gadgets since Hong Kong's outlets are different. If you forgot to bring, you can buy at the front desk for 20 HKD.","June 15, 2019","1    Royal View Hotel

83,"The photos of this hotel are not consistent with the room I stayed in. The carpet was stained, the lights in the shower flickered sporadically, there was hair in the bathroom sink (upon my arrival), the room periodically smelled of smoke (even on a no smoking floor), and the overall cleanliness was poor. The worse part is the bed. I have slept on softer surfaces while camping. Sleeping was literally the most miserable experience, I tried to bunch my comforter to sleep on top of it for some level of padding. Both my coworker (who was in another room) and I woke up with sore bodies from the bed. My experience was so poor we canceled the remainder of our reservation and moved to another hotel.I do have to say the staff was very nice and the view of Lido beach was beautiful.","February 24, 2019","1    Royal View Hotel

85,"Stayed here for 4 days with family (2 kids). Hugo - the Hotel receptionist provided great service and made us feel at home at the time of check in. Hotel room is clean and very cozy...great shower. The room had a great view of the river. It is however, a little out of the way from most of the exciting parts of HK. You needed to take the hotel shuttle service to get to the transit station. Taxi is a bit strange, some drivers do not speak English well and the hotel staff did not alert us that we may need to take one of those cards from the hotel with chinese writings to help us direct taxi driver to bring us back to the hotel.Other than language issue, everything went well and we are well rested and enjoyed the stay.I think this hotel is good for those who would like to chill out and be away from the hustle and bustle of city life.(it is a pity though, we were not able to use the pool at that time - because the hotel close it).","February 3, 2019","1    Royal View Hotel

87,"My family with 2 kids stayed in a family room for 10 days and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We booked a family room which was very spacious and clean. The beds was nice and firm and comfy. Our room was on the top floor and we had an amazing view. Free bottled water was provided everyday, the room has good amenities and the hotel is nice and quiet. The hotel staff are very friendly and spoke well English. From the front desk staff to shuttle bus staff and even cleaners are wonderful and helpful. Location wise, it is in Ting Kau, next to a beach and not right in Tsuen Wan. However the hotel free shuttle bus service is very convenient. The bus runs frequently every 10mins or so and very on time. The shuttle line getting back to the hotel at night at Tsuen Wan MTR can be long but you can alternatively take a green van across the road for only $7HKD. There are so many good and cheap eateries in Tsuen Wan plus shopping centres. My kids also loved the video games room at the hotel! Overall we will definitely come back to royal view.

92,"Heard from friends that the facilities in this hotel is great. Found good deal online, so four of us visited during weekend. Although it’s not near the city, the hotel itself provided FREE shuttle bus from both tsuenwan and tsimshatsui. We took the shuttle from TW MTR, it took me 10 minutes only! The stop is just right to the MTR, Very convenient. :) and it’s quite frequent. After arriving the hotel, the hotel staff was very friendly and could provide sufficient information about the attractions nearby.After we checked in, the bedroom is comfortable and the toilet is large and clean. Our hotel room view is towards the swimming pool. It also provided enough bottle water for guests I like the gym room the best, it has different facilities. And the staff there was friendly. We did gym for around an hour. Jogging, cycling, pulling etc. THE MOST expecting part is the sauna. Very relaxed The wet and dry sauna room are well l-equipped and not too crowded by the time we arrived. The changing room also has free locker to save our belongings. However, the swimming pool is under reconstruction. Definitely would visit again next time :)","January 15, 2019","1    Royal View Hotel

It's far from HK island but they offer a free shuttle that takes you to an MTR station. The shuttle also comes right on schedule based on the timetable that they gave us. The views of the Ting Kau bridge from our seaview room were spectacular - really lovely to watch the sunrise there! The breakfast buffet has adequate food though I think that maybe they can switch it up a bit after a couple of days.

95,"Spent Christmas to new year here. Booked this hotel months before our flight schedule thru agoda at promotional price of Php 5,217.00/nightly family room without breakfast. I fortunately we missed our flight the day we supposedly first day in this hotel. But luckily we flew the next day. Here’s Ate the pros & cons.Pros: 1. this hotel is in Tsuen Wan, last station from Lantau island on the red line of Hong Kong MTR, Tsuen Wan known for cheaper place in hongkong. It’s near in Tsing Yi station going to central and back in airport. (Take note that the only fastest way to get in and back to airport is riding an arex. No other train will get you to central) 2. It’s a quiet place, near Ting Kau/lido beach just 5 minutes walking distance. View is great there and of course it’s free. 3. Since we missed our first day in hotel, this hotel gave us “free breakfast” for the entire stays for our family package. Foods are decent. 4. There is a hotel shuttle service for free every 15 minutes everyday, from 7am - 11pm going to and from Tsuen Wan MTR Station. Pretty accessible right?! There’s mtr mall there, a mini supermarket also. I can’t complain. 5. There’s “game room” for free. You can play Xbox, ps4 and one arcade game. Just ask reception/lobby to get the controller/s, sign the paper and game on! 6. There’s massage spa. It’s small but good. Though a bit expensive but give it a try. 7. There pool, but rarely open to use. Depends on the weather, I guess. 8. The room is quite spacious. (For a family of four) 9. It’s near in yung Chung line. Where Disneyland and Ngong Ping are located.10. Free unlimited WiFi Cons:1. They don’t change bed and pillows covers. They rarely well thorough clean the room.2. Bring your own razor, additional cotton buds, conditioner, cotton balls and other essentials. They don’t provide them for free. They only provide toothbrushes, shampoo, shower caps and sanitary plastic. 3. When you spend multiple days here, the WiFi seems to have Lags, and sometimes unreliable. 4. You need to bring international adaptor, though they provide one, but it could be less an issue if you provide your own. 5. Do not order “in-room food” no taste and definitely expensive. Unless you want and can afford tasteless low quality meal. 6. Housekeeping tend to be lazy to fully clean up the room, specially if you stay with kids, they rarely vacuum the floor, and neglect to dust. 6. Advisable to book this hotel from third party as it get cheaper than booking directly. All in all I still recommend this hotel for the main concern It provides. Even if you arrive late the MTR operates from 6am- 1am so it still cheaper to get yourself a cab or uber from Tsuen Wan station to this hotel. If ever I’m going back to hongkong I will book this hotel months before my arrival. ","January 1, 2019","1    Royal View Hotel

100,"There Royal View Hotel seemed a big place fancy place after two months in Nepal; everything was clean, comfortable and overall the place had a well cared for feel. The hotel is located right up against one of Hong Kongs many impressive bridges but noise never seemed to be an issue. Down below the hotel, next to and even under the bridge, is a nice little swimming beach; it’s just a short walk with views of the bay along the way.Our room was on the 19th floor and had a feeling of being tucked right up under the bridge but it was quiet and getting off the elevators we enjoyed great views of the bridges and bay. Our room was modern and room. The beds firm and the linens cozy. The bathroom was very clean and the water really hot. The complimentary breakfast was diverse and very good. However, dinner options at the hotel were limited to a rather expensive buffet or room service.The location of the Royal View, next to the bridge and bay, is interesting but otherwise somewhat inconvenient. The hotel does run a free shuttle to town, the trip takes 10-15 minutes, and the wait was never more than a few minutes. The shuttle only makes one stop but that drops you off near other transit options and plenty of restaurants.We got our room at a good price online and if we were again in Hong Kong would stay at the Royal View again.","December 12, 2018","1    Royal View Hotel

It isn't too hard to get to/from the city or airport via public bus, but the area is quite remote and this would definitely not be a suitable base for sightseeing in the city. Overall I was disappointed with this hotel - the service was perfunctory and impersonal (and check-in was very slow, the lone agent at the front desk spent approximately 15 minutes talking to one lady).The beds and shower were good, but the room had seen better days, lots of dust in corners and in the drawers/cabinets. Unfortunately the room had limited soundproofing, which is not good when many of the hotel guests lack basic consideration and have loud late night conversations in the hallways outside guestrooms. As there are plenty of options to choose from during my next visit to Hong Kong, I don't think I will return here. ","November 15, 2018","1    Royal View Hotel

I found the small room, surprisingly comfortable and efficient, and other amenities just what I needed for travel (work out room clean, well ventilated and equipped for light workout), thus satisfying my needs like a much larger at a fraction the price!

The hotel has its own shuttle service where they will drop you off near the Kwai Fong MTR station and they will also pick you up in the designated area, the shuttle service is always on time. the hotel is location is near a fast food chain and a convenience store if you do not have time to shop for food you can always go to the nearest fast food. The Breakfast Buffet is not that overwhelming but its enough for you to provide energy for the entire day. The room was small but enough for 2 person, since we only stayed there to sleep and take a bath we did not mind the space. The bathroom was clean and showers was pressurised. Just make sure to bring your own shampoo and soap, the hotel provide bath products but it was not my preferred scent. Hair Dryer is readily available as well.","May 7, 2019","2    Silka Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

141,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in April 2019. I thought it was excellent value for money. Especially the staff made all the difference by having a great attitude and manner. Reception staff: Spoke great English and were always polite. Concierge staff: Did a perfect job of keeping the shuttle buses, taxis and coaches moving out on time when there was a build up of traffic in the street. They were polite even in the busy times.Shuttle bus: On time, every time. Leaving the hotel and at pick up points. I hadn't planned on relying on the shuttle bus due to my experiences at other hotels, but this one was done right, so I used it 3 out of my 6 days. Make sure you make a reservation for a morning bus the night before though because there are limited spaces and sometimes walk-ups can't get on in the mornings.Shuttle Bus time taken to downtown Tsim Sha Tsui:Hotel to China Ferry Terminal (Tsim Sha Tsui): 45 minutes (You can get ferries to Macau or walk to the Star Ferry Terminal through a shopping centre from there.)Free smartphone: Each room has a smartphone that you can take outside the hotel with you and use as a mobile WiFi hotspot for your own phones and mobile devices. That was an incredibly convenient bonus. I didn't have to pay extra for a Mobile wifi unit at the airport and worry about returning after. The phone could make free local calls, too, but I didn't use that feature. Concierge manager: (I think he was the manager by his age and air of authority) He was especially excellent. When we had ordered taxis by the in-room phone, he would pick us out from the crowd in the ground floor lobby area and show us to the taxi, confirm the destination in Chinese with the driver and give me a guideline price so I know what to expect. He also paid attention to our destination and offered advice such as letting us know Disneyland has a policy of no food and drink to be taken into the park. Thanks to his comment we quickly checked the internet (with the hotel mobile wi-fi hotspot) and found that we could take 1 water bottle each and they were lenient on kids with two bottles and snacks so we readjusted our bags to even out our drinks and food instead of me carrying everything.Then we were careful to pick a security line with staff who were not checking bags strictly. (For example, on one line a strict lady was checking every backpack deeply and some food and a canned drink was removed. But in our line the staff member just looked in the top of the bag and felt the bottom of the bag from the outside to check if there were any cans in there.) Breakfast: It was included in my room reservation, which was the cheapest available at that time. 7-10am. I found it to be above expectations on my first day, but like anything you get used to it after 5 days. It had a mix of Chinese and western breakfast including fried eggs, scrambled egg, sausage, boiled ham, chicken nuggets, baked beans, salad bar, fruit bar, Chinese dumplings, fried rice, noodles, and other things I can't name. Great freshly ground coffee machine, too. Cereal and toast available, too and some soft drinks. Restaurant had enough tables so we never felt overcrowded.Room: Clean. No unpleasant surprises. Includes toiletries like toothbrush, toothpaste, shaver, sewing set, shampoo, soap. Water temperature and power ok. One day, the cleaning staff didn't change the sheets as requested, but that was fixed the next day. The reception staff always responded to requests satisfactorily. Kettle and tea, instant coffee in the room. One water bottle for each guest replaced daily. That was a nice touch.To the management of Silka Tsuen: Give your concierge manager a bonus and praise your staff. They made the hotel shine.To other hotels if you read these reviews looking for ideas: free smartphones in rooms please! It will be a new deal breaker for me I think :-) Also, water bottles each day are good, too.Taxi prices that I paid:Airport to hotel 280 HKD (10pm) 45 minutesHotel to airport 241 HKD (8am)I don't know why there's a price difference, I think the driver on my first trip might have overcharged me slightly but I can't be sure.He pressed a button on the top right of his meter a few times to boost the price saying it was for the highway and night rate. But I didn't want to argue about it. The final driver taking us back to the airport in the morning only pressed the top right button once to add the highway toll fee.I suspect the second guy was the honest one. Hotel to Disneyland 160 HKD (9am) 25 minutesDisneyland to hotel 190 HKD (8pm)Again, a price difference. I'm not sure why. Several pressings of the ""magic"" meter button going on.Overall, thanks to the hotel staff I had a great stay. I would definitely stay here again if I went to Hong Kong again.(If you found this review useful, why not take a look at my books available on Amazon ""Hanatoki: Japan Flower Shop"", ""Winning Sports Betting Strategies"" and ""Big Data Betting"" by Tom Whitaker.)Once again, thanks to the hotel staff I had a great stay. This hotel is relatively new and very clean, so I think for the prices it charges, it is very reasonable. The shuttle bus, free water and especially the free smartphone use all add up to make the stay very smooth and pleasant.","May 6, 2019","2    Silka Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

Emailed them 2 days before asking for directions from HKIA, and they promptly answered my inquiry, giving me a lot of options. Upon arrival at the hotel premise, man from the concierge (sorry, forgot the name) immediately help me with my luggage and bag upon stepping down the shuttle direct me to the 1F for check in. It was early morning (around 12noon), Receptionist Keith assist me, provided me a copy of shuttle bus schedules and a map of restaurants nearby hotel - a plus, most of the hotel I've stayed in HK doesn't really bother to introduce you with the area, whether you are a newbie or pro, this kind of gesture really helps. Keith also let me go to my designated room (note: time is prior standard check in time) which is a BIG PLUS to me since I'm tired from my early flight and mostly didn't experienced this with previous hotel I've checked in around HK. Unable to bring with me adaptor, but housekeeping lend me with just 1 phone call. A great small room (a HK standard) but filled with everything I needed - cable tv, mini fridge, safebox, toiletries, minibar, cabinets, hangers, slippers and a smartphone with internet you can bring with you for free use. A nice mini garden to relax after a long day or lazy afternoon weekends, a gym and buffet restaurant.

We were greeted by the staff who handled our luggage from the taxi.

The rooms are very large. Our double beds seem short but my friends king didnt appear short. The extra bed to accommodate our 3rd person was too hard so my daughter slept with me.The buffet breakfast which is included was excellent. We loved all of the spa services.

The hotel was easy to spot right across the street.We were warmly greeted and able to check in early after a long flight from Barcelona. The hotel room was perfect in every way. The included breakfast was delicious with all types of food. We had a late lunch one day and room service one night. Highly recommend the curry.I had a problem with the travel adapter we brought and asked to borrow another one at the front desk. Instead, two staff members came to our room and got it to work. Very impressed. We never had to open a door while going outside or getting an elevator.The location was so convenient with frequent bus service. We also did a 5 or 6 mile round trip hike to The Peak on a really quiet trail and were rewarded with gorgeous views.We stayed at the InterContinental after our time here which was great, but to be honest we preferred the T Hotel's staff and service.

164,"We had a very nice stay at The T Hotel recently. My wife uses an electric scooter, and the staff was very accommodating. The room and entire hotel was very clean, and we would definitely use it again in the future. Other positives include super-friendly staff, a good fitness center, and a great price (especially since it includes breakfast). Plus you get to watch raptors soaring right outside your window, and there's a great trail to The Peak that starts just up the street.Some (minor) negatives...1. The location isn't super-convenient, since it's on the opposite side of the island from Central, and not close to any MTR stop. There's not much going on in the Pokfulam area (though that can be a good thing).2. Taxi drivers sometimes have trouble finding the hotel, and once a cab we ordered (via SynCab) didn't show up because he couldn't find it.3. The breakfast buffet is a bit limited, compared to other hotels in HK.4. The handicap room didn't have a roll-in/walk-in shower.5. We had to learn that some more complex requests need to be made to the instructors, versus the trainees.All in all we had a very good experience, and would definitely stay there again.","June 5, 2019","3    The T Hotel

Breakfast was varied with many options to choose from. We also recommend booking to eat both Chinese and Western meals from the culinary institute for lunch! The students worked hard to help with anything we needed and there was always support for them from their teachers. The hotel is located in Pokfulam, which is an easy one-bus ride from the airport on the A10. Other buses whisked us back to the MTR and we even took the bus to Stanley.

They don’t always understand what you want but do their utmost to help you and will always call a senior staff member to translate. Great rooms well managed and very clean and comfortable. We had a wonderful view over the Lamma Channel. A great breakfast included in the rate with a big variety of dishes to choose from and freshly made egg dishes. Not so great in making a latte! The lounge is also open for lunch,tea and dinner. We had dinner twice and were very pleased.

167,"OK, so we found the T Hotel courtesy of Tripadvisor, rather than our own detective work but what a great place. As you’ll have seen, the hotel trains staff to work in the hospitality industry but that doesn’t mean there’s any compromise on standards. This is basically a 4 star (in some respects 5 star) hotel for a lot less than you’ll find anywhere else in HK. The rooms are spacious (ours came with a sea view), the food is excellent, there’s a decent gym and location-wise you’re on the island with a host of buses stopping outside.

Nothing is to hard or an inconvenience to arrange.The hotel was having a Chinese lunar new year dinner on the Friday. We asked if we could get in to the dinner, we were informed it was booked out :( I mentioned in passing that we were having our 34th anniversary the next day. We left for our daily exploring trip. When we returned there was a message on our phone. The concierge had heard our conversation with the staff and had managed to get us in for the dinner. To say it was spectacular is an understatement. The food & service was the best we have seen in our many years of travelling. Then we came back to our room on Saturday to find our bed was decorated with rose petals, fruit with plates & knife, and love heart swans. Our day was just perfect as there was also champagne waiting for us as the sunset on the balcony.Most people think this hotel is too far from everything, but they are incorrect. *It is an easy 30 min walk to the peak for the best views*There is public transport right out the front to take you to anywhere on the island and main land*There is a free shuttle to the train station & ferry every Monday to Friday (would be good if it was everyday)*The bus from/ To the airport leaves directly in front of the hotel and is an easy 1 hour trip.

The service provided is excellent, in particularly the front desk team, under the expert and professional guidance of Elisa, Gabriella and Christie. We were most grateful for the early check in facilitated after arriving in Hong Kong on an overnight flight, and for providing storage for a piece of luggage when we went to Japan for a few days.

172,"Ssshh. Don't tell anyone but this training hotel has to be one of Hong Kong's hidden best value gems. Easily accessible from the airport by public airport express bus, or a short taxi ride from the central railway station, it is of the highest quality. The bonus is being looked after by a plethora of helpful eager to please students learning on the job. The hotel, on the 6th floor of a hospitality school and near the Chinese Culinary, has about 30 luxurious and well equipped rooms. The best have views to the west out over the shipping channels to the South China Sea. There were six staff to welcome us at ground level, and several to escort us and our bags to the 6th floor where one was nominated to show and explain all the gadgetry from a free mobile phone, to touch screen lighting. Our dining experience - a five course meal with wines - was up there with the best Michelin standard restaurants. Waiting staff were initially nervous but shadowed by a tutor, they were soon at ease advising on the wines, sweeping crumbs from the table and re-laying cutlery for each course. The included breakfast, in the dining room with a view, provided so many choices. We opted for omelettes, skilfully cooked to order by two shy and immaculately dressed young female chefs. All the usual options of cereal, bacon, beans, tomatoes, breads, European cold cuts as well as Asian breakfast styles were on offer. And a barista ! While the servicing of the room by about 4 or 5 young people may have taken a little longer, it was thorough, and the rooms and bathroom were immaculate and the bedding of the highest quality. From the bus stop on PokFu Lam road we headed either into the city, or the other way down to the old fishing community of Aberdeen. The senior transport card, Octopus, purchased at the airport, covered these bus trips for about $A2 a trip. Compared to our previous expensive and hectic experiences in Hong Kong, this was a delightfully restful and rewarding time, knowing we were also helping to foster a new generation of hospitality staff. But don't say anything. Everyone will want to stay here.","January 6, 2019","3    The T Hotel

We arrived late in the evening and we were taken to the reception floor. The staff were very professional and the check-in was smooth.We stayed on the 6th Floor, with a sea view , looking over the South China Sea and Aberdeen. The room was excellent, and very clean. A remote control, by the bedside was available to turn on/off lights and the air con. The mini bar, to my surprise was very cheap for a hotel. Just 12 Hong Kong Dollars for a beer (just over a £1). The rooms also provide a smart phone, that you can take with you, when travelling around Hong Kong. We used this to find streets and restaurants. We could also phone local and international for free.All staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. As it's a training hotel, majority of the staff are learning. During breakfast, the staff were pleasant and made our staff good.Can't really say there was anything negative about this hotel. The only constructive criticism I have is, that the breakfast set up needs to be adjusted. On the egg station, the young trainee only had 1 frying pan. This could cause problems if the hotel is busy. This area should have more pans, so that at least 2 people could cater for the demand. Due to language barriers, it would be a good idea to have definitions of different egg dishes in several languages and with visual aids. I found that boiled eggs weren't understood.The highlight of the stay, was eating in the Chinese Restaurant on the 7th Floor. You can book to have lunch here and it was just amazing. The best meal of my whole stay. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Transport is easy, as the bus stop is outside the hotel, and it has numerous buses stopping.

178,"We really enjoyed our stay at the T Hotel and would highly recommend.Getting to the hotel from the airport is very easy, there's a bus that takes you right to the door in about 45 mins. When you get off the bus the entrance to the hotel is not immediately obvious and when you find it, you feel more like you're entering a factory loading area rather than a hotel.Don't panic! The lobby of the hotel is more what you'd expect and hope for. It is a training hotel and we were checked in by a possy of students, all very polite and the ones that were actively checking us in were efficient. We were very fortunate, we arrived at the hotel at about 08.30, well before check in, but our room was ready for us by 09.30. After an overnight flight this was much appreciated.The room itself was very comfortable and had a stunning view out to sea. Rooms are on the 6th floor but you feel like you're much higher up. The ensuite had both a bath (with TV) and a very good shower. The bed was great (not to hard and not too soft unlike others on this trip) and the proportions of room, bed and bathroom generous. Breakfast was the one point when it became apparent that the T hotel is a training hotel. The food was fine, not the best breakfast but that's largely down to personal taste and there's a sufficient selection on offer to ensure something for everyone. The service was more random with a feeling that there's a few too many students than necessary and as a result they get under each others feet or are tempted to chat amongst themselves. That said, they were friendly and helpful. The girls at the 6th floor reception / guest relations were lovely, very helpful and really friendly. The best and for us, most impressive, facility at the T hotel was the 'Handy', a smart phone provided for our use during our stay. This was enabled to allow us to access the Internet whilst out and about and make calls (including international calls). It was a god send and saved a fortune in international roaming charges.The location of the hotel is not the most glamorous that Hong Kong has to offer, nor the most central. However, it is incredibly well served by buses, there are plenty of buses going to downtown and even direct buses to Kowloon (for the Temple Street night Market and Mong Kok) and Happy Valley. It's also easy to get to Aberdeen. Sadly we weren't there long enough to go to Repulse Bay or Causeway. However, the buses are frequent (we never waited more than 5 mins for a bus when leaving the hotel), efficient and ran late into the night so we never felt too far away from the action. One word of caution, the airport bus was early the day we departed and it only runs every half an hour so, if you're relying on it to catch your flight, don't leave it till the last minute! All in all, the T Hotel represents excellent value for money and we would certainly stay there again. ","October 20, 2018","3    The T Hotel

179,"We stayed for 3 nights over the weekend when the super typhoon hit the region. What amazed us was the great hospitality (exceeds five star hotels I suppose) as well as attentiveness of the hotel staffs, including trainees at each section. Even though my 7 year old son was able to neither speak English nor Cantonese very well, they kindly talked to him many times. On the final day, some staff talked to him even in Japanese! Also, he was very surprised by a cup of cocoa latte with Ponyo’s art, which was so cute. Such a kindness dedicated to us made our stay superb. Not only human aspect but also the IT support provided is one of their strong points of the hotel. The room featured a smartphone with free internet access, local calls and international call to 10 designated countries, which allowed us to safely return to the hotel and make a delayed flight confirmation call to the airline office outside HK. When it comes to the location there should be pros and cons. I love the location, though.We’ll definitely come back to the hotel when visiting HK next time. ","September 17, 2018","3    The T Hotel

183,"Where to begin! The T Hotel epitomizes 5star quality at 3 star prices. Understanding what it represents will ensure a fabulous stay. The hotel is set up for training students in hospitality, chefs, admin, front desk, room service etc. They are shadowed at all times by their tutors/ professionals and work their way through conversation in a range of languages and could not be more attentive and helpful. The rooms only on one floor are stunning. Awesome views across the waters of Hong Kong were well worth the trek to get there. They are furnished to the highest degree, all different and I believe there are suites too. We had a TV in the bathroom, an amazing range of toiletries, slippers and dressing gowns provided, huge bed, and chocolates on the pillow each night. Breakfast was included for us and it proved to be a wonderful smorgasbord of continental, cooked and Chinese traditional food. Absolutely nothing is too much trouble for the staff who are on hand at every turn. They organised Octopus cards for us to travel, advised us of the easiest way to get back to the hotel and provide free shuttle buses to Central or Star Ferry during the week. The only downside is the location which is a 20 min bus ride (or bus and MTR) to Central but so much fun trying different routes and taking photos. There is a Spa/ gym available for guests and you automatically become a member of the dining society (TDS) which gives the chefs an opportunity to reallly home their skills in both the Chinese or Western dining rooms where English Speaking is part of the experience. Worked for us. I cannot commend the staff and students highly enough for ensuring we had a wonderful stay. A heavy thunderstorm which blew in as we were about the head out to the airport bus (a two minute walk to the road in front of the hotel) resulted in 2 students on the front desk carrying umbrellas and our luggage (though we did help) and trying to keep us dry. They waited until the bus arrived and ensured we were safely on board. Wow! Pokfulam, where the hotel is situated is quite out of the way of most attractions and other hotels so not good for walking to nearby restaurants etc, Definitely a short but easy bus/ train ride to eat out or experience HK attractions. Across the road is the old village of Pokfulam which is quite an amazing sight to see how people still live locally. A highly recommended experience if you are happy to be away from the main hubs of Hong Kong.","August 7, 2018","3    The T Hotel

We got a taxi from the airport which was less than the hotel's estimated cost for the trip, great value in fact and if you cant be bothered with shuttles or buses do this! Check in was warm and welcoming. Our room was wonderful with breath taking views out to sea. My husband, who is an avid ship spotter, was in seventh heaven with all the large container ships passing by! The room was large, beautifully furnished and well equipped. The shower (important in the humidity) was wonderful.Every night we ate dinner at the training restaurant and it was delicious, as was breakfast each morning. Our only feedback would be that we would have liked a few daily specials at dinner perhaps, just to break the sameness of the menu each night. Drinks and food were reasonably priced for Hong Kong and brilliant value.The little shopping centre about 5 mins walk away was great for water, groceries and any other extras(pharmacy) you may need.As other reviewers have said the service and attention in all public areas is very intense but the students were so enthusiastic and lovely that this can be forgiven and is understandable.I had a 30min massage while there and it was incredible, highly recommend and would have booked a longer massage but they had no spaces left, so get in early!Thank you to everyone at the T Hotel for making our stay so wonderful. We loved being there and will definitely return! Tina :-)","August 5, 2018","3    The T Hotel

Across the street from a settlement village (not the correct term, but . . .) and the market by the bus stop is NOT to be missed if you want to appreciate local culture.

186,"It’s a hotel that help train hospitality students getting ready for the real world. When we arrived late in the evening, they were already waiting for us. With the supervisor we were ushered to our very comfortable and spacious room. Everything in the room was explained to us in details as that was part of their training. It was kind of nice that one can participate in the training as being the guests. On our part we need to be patient sometimes with the understanding that they are under training. The view from the room was beautiful. You looked into the Bay. The room was well stocked with everything you need.... from bathroom to mini fridge and tea and coffee. There was also a free shuttle service to the city centre So that was very convenient. Breakfast was amazingly well done, again by students and their trainer chefs... TOP quality. Everyone was attentive and service was very good. You can see that the young people tried their best effort and that really made you so satisfied and just wanted to encourage each and everyone of them.Checking out we had the manager and the trainees seeing us right up to our cab. That was some service right till the end. Like I said it is a different kind of experience and you get good quality and great service in this hotel. I would recommend it and I personally will stay here again when I visit Hong Kong.","June 18, 2018","3    The T Hotel

187,"Booked it based on the trip adviser score and the fact the price was very reasonable for the quality and amenities. We were a little worried about location as neither of us had been to Hong kong before, however don't let it's position put you off. The public transport system is excellent and we had no difficulty getting anywhere in Hong Kong from the hotel. There are buses every few minutes that pass right outside, we tended to jump on one of the north bound buses and hop off at hong kong university mtr which was less than 10 minutes away, then hop on a train to central again these were every 5 or 10 minutes. We took the A10 bus from the airport to get to the hotel which again was her easy as the bus has a digital screen showing the various stops so it was simply a case of pressing the stop button once the pok fu lam village stop was next., the hotel is pretty much opposite the bus stop so was easy to find. It is a training hotel so some of the staff were a little unsure of themselves and occasionally we had an issue with the language barrier but they just call in the more experience staff and it's sorted. The hotel was extremely clean and well run, the room was large with a bath and large walk in shower we had an ocean view the rooms on the other side have a view of the peak ( there are 2 routes up to the peak and Victoria peak from the road the hotel is on which give some great views) there isn't a great deal of local restraunts , but the hotel menu was very reasonably priced and the kennedy area of hong kong is 10 minutes away by bus and has lots of restraunts and cafes. They also give you a handy phone, which is a pre loaded mobile you can take with you on your trips out so you are never without internet, you can even load up your own facebook accounts etc. We found this very useful , especially as it meant we had access to Google maps. Great hotel and we would deffo stay again, one tip if you have a while between check out and your flights hong kong station has check in desks for most major airlines so we just took our luggage to the the train station and checked them in, collected our boarding passes leaving us the rest of the day to spend in Hong Kong.","June 1, 2018","3    The T Hotel

188,"Isn't it amazing when your expectations and the reviews match perfectly with your actual experience at a property? We absolutely loved our stay at The T Hotel.1. Smooooth pre-checkin and check-in: All my queries prior to the actual stay were handled perfectly well by Oscar, one of the trainee students from front desk.   2. View to die for: The room had a gorgeous view: The perfect mix of ocean and urban life (half and half). It had a huge glass window, length of the entire room, so nothing comes in the way of your view! 3. Amenities: The room was perfectly equipped with all the basic amenities, and some even more than basic, such as a hair dryer, iron and ironing board. It has a well-equipped gym. 4. High-tech: The room was super high-tech, which included a bathtub with a screen in front with select TV channels, a glass separating the bathroom and living room, which becomes either see-through or opaque at the click of a button!! The lighting and air conditioning were managed by a separate all-in-one control device. A separate handset was provided for use in the room, with which you can make free international calls from within the room only! 5. An amazing overhead and hand shower!! 6. Courteous staff: Our phone chargers needed a different socket. They arranged for it promptly! All the students, and in fact the entire staff, greets you with a genuine hearty smile, which just makes your day. 7. The view from the dining area is perhaps the best I've experienced so far. It was gorgeous!8. The buffet spread was fine, but I had expected more from a property that specializes in culinary skills, in terms of more variety. I'd rate it 8/10. 9. Proximity and convenience: The main bus stop is literally at the entrance of the hotel, less than a minute's walk. Even the A10 that goes to the airport. It was extremely convenient to go anywhere from the hotel without having to rely on a taxi or Uber. ","May 16, 2018","3    The T Hotel

189,"The concept of training young ones in hospitality and tourism is brilliant and well perfected. The hotel provides excellent service. The staff, including the trainees are excellent. Before arrival, the staff helped with my transportation to the hotel. I was given all options from Public Bus A10 {HKD 48} which goes directly from the Airport to the hotel, to the more luxurious limo service. The bus stop is opposite the hotel. On arrival. I met a friendly and welcoming staff at the door and reception. I was escorted by two students to my room. The restaurant serves very good food.

190,"Stayed 4 nights at The T hotel in Feb with my wife based on reviews I read on tripadvisor. Did not disappoint, live up to all the expectations I read from the reviews.Especially impressed with all the staffs right down to the security.Had meals at the Chinese and Western restaurants and both were equally good.Location is great for walking as the trails are just across the road. Can walk all the way to the Peak , have a meal at the many restaurants there and track back all within a day. Or walk to the Peak and go down Central by the mid level escalator. Lots of F & B outlets along the way down to Central or Lan Kwai Fong. Can also reach the HK university through the trails and catch the MTR there. If you find walking up the peak too steep, take a bus to the Macau Ferry Terminal on Connaught Road Central and take the no 15 up to the Peak. Walk downhill back to The T Hotel from there. A lot easier.Accessibility is also great with many buses to Central , Kowloon or to the south at Stanley and Aberdeen.Ask the staff for assistance to download the Goggle map for the area if you want to do the trails.Thank you The T Hotel , I will be back to do the trails in the south.Michael and Patricia Chong - Singapore","April 18, 2018","3    The T Hotel

191,"I’d recently stayed 3 nights at the T Hotel after reading the positive comments on TripAdvisor. The location is out of the usual tourist belt so be prepared for the extra distance if you choose this hotel. From HKIA I took the Airport Bus A10. As rightly pointed out by some earlier reviewers, it is at Stop No. 26 that you alight and the Hotel is just across the road. If you have a big heavy luggage bag, be aware that you’ll need to walk up a little slope to reach the hotel.The guest room is very spacious even though it’s a standard room. I stayed at a Mountain View room which looks onto a mountain but also a village of congested zinc roof houses very tightly built against each other.The gym is well equipped and I was the lone user that day.The breakfast lounge has stunning seaview and it’s a real pleasure compared to other city hotels which look out to another very close building.Food wise I find the breakfast of a average quality. I had dinner at the lounge - cod fish with fried rice. I like the cod fish but not the fried rice.Service wise some of the staff (who are trainees) were a bit hesitant to approach the guests and tend to wait by the side. Some did not understand my questions (in English), had to consult their colleagues. However the senior staff are good and they could anticipate the needs of the guests.Transport wise I took the local buses to Central and on my return trips to Hotel I took the MTR to HKU station and then transfer to a local bus back to the hotel. It was quite straightforward after you had tried once and know the system.I did a trekking one morning - walking from the hotel (starting from Pok Fu Lam Reservoir) to The Peak and then walking downhill from the Peak to Central. The weather was cool that day so it was a fun hike.Overall it was an enjoyable stay and I will recommend the T Hotel.","March 15, 2018","3    The T Hotel

Especially thanks trainee Hugo and probably tutor Mr. Kwan who arranged a nice room and extended my check-out time as a courtesy so I could have a good rest after a long night.

193,"We stayed at the T hotel because it was five minutes walk from our student son's accommodation at University Hall. What a great decision it turned out to be. As many have said, this is a training hotel so if you aren't willing to tolerate a few 'learning experiences' from the great kids there, stay somewhere else. The guests here are 'props' after all, from which the kids learn, but 'props' who are generally treated like royalty! The kids were great, the staff were great, the views, the rooms, the service and the food were not only superb, but also great value. Even the wine is a bargain, though the wine-list needs to be improved. Not a criticism, but if like us you like a nightly tipple, you might want to bring something back from the supermarket. Thank you EVERYONE at the T hotel for a wonderful experience! We hope to stay again if we ever re-visit this fabulous city.","February 27, 2018","3    The T Hotel

194,"This is a hidden gem imho. It is far from other parts of Hong Kong. It is by Hong Kong University. You need to take a bus from Kennedy Town MTR station, or use Taxi. Taxi's are not costly, $150HKD from Tsim Sha Tsui to T Hotel. Probably less if you are getting from the Airport Express station in Hong Kong.The rooms are huge. All the room views, as far as I can tell, are facing the sea and fantastic overlooking the sea, with ships sailing past all the time. During the morning I saw eagles hovering in front of the room's window. The staff is extremely attentive. They are students training to enter the hospitality industry.

195,"Hong Kong at “The T Hotel “. I just completed my 5th stay at The T Hotel which is a 30 room training hotel located on the 6th floor of a vocational training center that overlooks Hong Kong Harbor. There they train students in all aspects of the hotel industry from reservations, reception, restaurant, room service, housekeeping, business center, gym, massage, security etc. All of the students are monitored very closely by their training supervisors. This is a small 5 star property at 3 star rates. The service provided is exceptional and you are always greeted and attended to immediately. The rooms as you will see in the photos are luxurious, the amenities top notch and the views are exceptional. All I need to say is if you are ever in Hong Kong try it. Everything is within a 10-40 minute trek with the airport and Disneyland on the 40 minute end. Downtown is only 10 minutes away and less than a $1 US bus ride away. Taxis are very reasonable options also.Enjoy Hong Kong, I always do.","February 18, 2018","3    The T Hotel

Well I did stay there with my wife for close to 2 weeks, and I was very impressed with the room and the service. You must understand that it is a training hotel, so sometimes you will get a server or cook at the omelette station for breakfast in their restaurant who isn't top notch. But most of the time, you will get a server who will do everything in their power to give you the best service possible. The intention to give excellent service is always there even if a mistake is made here and there. At one point, I was joking with my wife when we came to the elevator that ""no one has come to push the elevator button for us!"" Literally 1 second later, someone came over and pushed the button for the elevator to come for us! We had to laugh. The food is excellent and isn't expensive at all! The room was very spacious and had a nice view as well. I also love that they offer a shuttle service to the main areas where you can get further travel to all parts of the island and beyond. Definitely would stay there again.","January 27, 2018","3    The T Hotel

198,"What a fabulous hotel. We arrived in the morning with the intention of dropping our bags off and going somewhere until we could book in. A lovely young trainee helped us, when she needed some help she called the manager who finished the booking process. He then informed us our room was ready and we could go up now, wow how fabulous as we were extremely tired after along overnight flight. Yuki the trainee (I apologize if I have the name wrong) took us up to the room and showed us how everything worked. The room was amazing it is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Everything was spotless, lovely amenities in the bathroom, tea and coffee, floor to ceiling window with a view that you could just sit and watch all day and night. Everywhere we went the young staff who are training went out of there way. The breakfast was great with once again very attentive staff. We ordered room service a couple of times and the food was great. About 6 o’clock they come with an ice bucket and a little plate of something delicious. A special mention must be give to Tiffany the guest relations person, she went above and beyond to help us navigate our way around. She is a credit to the training provided. The hotel is a fair distance away but the bus service at the front of the hotel is excellent and we had no trouble getting to all the places on our list to visit. We will come to Hong Kong again and without a doubt will stay at the T hotel. Thank you to all for making our first visit to Hong Kong so memorable.","January 22, 2018","3    The T Hotel

200,"We love staying at the T-Hotel. We’ve stayed here five times – each visit has been for about two weeks. We find the T-Hotel suits us very well for its:• Service that is high quality The staff are really friendly and helpful, and the students follow their example to the best of their ability.• Rooms that are a good size, well-equipped, tastefully decorated, quiet and with pleasing views – and wi-fi• Comfortable beds with good mattresses and a range of pillows to choose from• Cleanliness• Memorable breakfasts, with a wide range of tempting choices – both western and Chinese• Room service with an acceptable menu, presented to a high standard. • In-restaurant lunch and dining - western and Chinese - is also available. Really good and reasonable value• Well-equipped gym. (We haven’t used the spa services.)• More peaceful surroundings than central Hong Kong – plenty of trees nearby and country park walks• Supermarket, friendly post office and other every-day shops at the nearby shopping centre (nb not designer or international brand shops – there are masses of these in central Hong Kong) • Transport links with central Hong Kong/Kowloon/Airport (a bit more on this below)A special feature of the T-Hotel is that it’s a training hotel. So staying here helps the trainees learn their profession. Understandably, they will sometimes need to consult their supervisors to have tasks explained. This is not problem for us – we are not guests-in-a-hurry.Transport: If you arrive at the Airport and it’s your first time in Hong Kong, taking the Airport Express (light rail) to Hong Kong Station, and then a taxi from there, may be the simplest way to the T-Hotel. Or a taxi all the way, but it’s quite a distance - about 40 kilometres. Or there’s the A10 Airport Bus which stops very near the T-Hotel (Pok Fu Lam Village stop – it takes just over an hour and in November 2017 costs just under HK$50). The buses don’t give change. Much more transport information is available at the Hotel and on websites – including the Octopus Card, which can be a good buy if you will be staying a few days or longer. Also, the T-Hotel has its own complimentary mini-bus for trips to Central – you need to book.","December 5, 2017","3    The T Hotel

Hey ya have to learn somewhere and the value cannot be beat, right along with the turndown service and the cheery smiles. I have to say, these students are on their game. I felt like I had an entire staff at my beck and call the entire time, although there was a bit of a language barrier when I had to call the front desk for anything. But hey, I am the lesson. The view from the restaurant at the T Hotel was SPECTACULAR! And the food was delish. I wish that had been my room view. I was booked with the ""mountain"" view room which looked out over a mountain and the village (slums) below. It is hard to see that level of poverty, but the reality is it exists. I would definitely stay here again and almost want to to give the spa a whirl. I would recommend you looking at a photograph of the property.

209,"First off, The hospitality and service of the staff and students are hands down the best! Having elite status with many hotel chains, I can tell you that none come close to the T Hotel. In a way, it did seem a little awkward at first because of how much they go above and beyond but you get used to it.Room - Very clean and luxurious with a beautiful view. We stayed on the floor with the restaurant and it was weird having to pass by people eating and not being dressed up.Wifi - No issues with wifi and it worked fine.Price paid - Well worth the price I paid!Location - If there was one thing I can complain about, it would be the location. Far from most attractions and there isn't anything around the area. Ocean Park would be the number one place to go if you do stay here since it is close by. With that said, you can catch buses in front of the hotel to get where you want to go. Nothing you can do about the location so it wasn't a big deal.Overall, A great place to stay for a family vacation and I would gladly stay here again.Also, quick shout-out to the front desk staff/students who helped me. Eric, Christie Leung and Yannie. Hong Kong has a bright future in the tourism field because of you all.","August 30, 2017","3    The T Hotel

210,"It's a unique experience to see student staff in training but they did quite well. Service was efficient and they were very helpful. The rooms are quite spacious. It wasn't at all difficult to get around using the bus service since the stop is right across the hotel- Pok Fu Lam Village is the bus stop. Area of improvement would be the mobile device- it would not act as a hotspot so couldn't use our own phones. We stayed during the storm and so one day, no students were around but service was uninterrupted. Recommended!","August 29, 2017","3    The T Hotel

211,"My 3rd visit and the hotel just keeps improving. I was there at the tail end of a long trip and was ready for some pampering in the lovely room in the proper king bed, the terrace over looking the South China Sea, the huge breakfast with eggs cooked just the way I like them, all at a reasonable price.I get the A10 bus straight from the airport to the hotel and sit upstairs and take in the view. On the return to the airport, I did the in town check-in as my flight left very late and I wanted to get rid of my heavy bag. The, I got the airport express train. The latest T Hotel improvements include a free smart phone loaded with very useful info, to use whilst there including free overseas phone calls to many countries. They also now have a cappuccino machine and some of the students know how to make a proper cup of coffee. The barista training could be improved upon however for some of the others. I loved having dinner on the terrace watching the sun go down, and watching the falcons flying on the thermals, and having room service - it's all the same reasonable price for the same menu. I like the location out of the business of the main areas of HKG. I'll be back.","August 15, 2017","3    The T Hotel

212,"The only downside to this hotel is how far away it is from Central Hong Kong. I booked the place knowing it was a bit remote but little did I know that it would take about 30-mins each way to get to the city center. It takes a few days to get used to the public transportation and the many buses that drive nearby the hotel to/from Central. The closest MTR metro station to the hotel is HKU about 10-15mins away from the hotel depending on the bus you catch (4, 4X as in express, 7, etc).So just be prepared to the commute as you visit HK and stay at the T-Hotel.Now that I talked about the cons of booking the hotel, its location is also a great place to be away from the city after a long day of walking in the heat & humidity of the island, shopping or touring sites.Pokfulam is a very hilly part of Hong Kong with lush green trees, and so the bus rides can feel like a roller coaster ride especially on the way from the hotel to Central.The taxis and buses really drive fast and almost recklessly per US standards, so fasten your seatbelts and avoid asking questions to the bus rider when in motion if you don't want to cause an accident.As for the rooms, they were really spacious and well equiped for the price... A real bargain for such amenities and space... and what a view as all reviews said... We had the South China Sea view room and it was amazing to behold day and night. The bathroom was nice too and they made sure to clean the place everyday and water the plants in the room, and provide bottled water.The staff is very attentive to your needs and despite the kids in training, they are very professional. Jenny Cheng, one of the main instructors, is a gem like everyone said. The breakfast was decent and affordable, nothing crazy but good.They also provide a free shuttle to Hong Kong station should you book it way in advance. This was great for going to the airport.Overall, despite its remote location, we really loved our stay at the T-hotel which is a 4 or 5 star hotel for 1/2 the price bc of its remote location and its training staff nature. Just make sure to allocate time for going to the city and back. The way to the city is to take the bus to the left right outside the hotel on the same side. The bus stop for the hotel is Pokfulam Village. I recommend exiting at HKU station and take the metro to wherever you want to go. And do the reverse on the way back. There are many buses and the staff at the hotel will tell you which bus can stop at the hotel or go downtown. Also make sure to buy an octopus metrocard from the hotel, it's $150 HKD for all your rides.","August 13, 2017","3    The T Hotel

213,"What can I say....excellent experience!! Highly recommend The T Hotel!!This is a training hotel so the staff is very attentive. Some things may take a wee bit longer as they are learning and customer service training is key. Location is a bit away from the central station, however, Hong Kong has a very efficient transit system so the location was not a problem, be sure to get an octopus card. Many busses stop right in front of the Hotel as well as the one from the airport.Check in was fast, they have an employee accompany you to your room and explain and show you how everything works. Very nice touch. Rooms are very nice, spacious, great views, very comfortable beds and pillows, great mini bar with very reasonable prices, Very nice bathrooms with tv's and telephones... 5 * rooms and technology for sure.Training Staff was excellent as well as the students. Really teaching them how to approach and engage the clients.Breakfast is included and very good buffet. Again, very attentive staff!! Great way to start your day. Restaurant is very good.This hotel is very reasonably priced, especially given the service they provide. We wanted to just stay and relax and enjoy the hotel however, we only had 3 days in Hong Kong and lots of sightseeing to do. Will stay here again with out a doubt next time we are in Hong Kong. Thank you to The T Hotel, we had a great experience during our stay.","August 1, 2017","3    The T Hotel

215,"We stayed at this hotel for a week and didn't want to leave! It's so wonderful, our children asked to stay here again if we ever get to visit Hong Kong again. The location worked well for us. There is a bus stop just a few steps out of the hotel. Very easy to travel around. We were treated like VIPs and the room is huge, even for North America standard. We got the ocean view room and the view is just marvelous. As we were hit by black rain one day, watching the weather in the safety of the hotel room was just an amazing experience. As this is a training hotel, you get to be part of the training program. It was a very nice experience and the instructors and managers are all very welcoming to show us the best quality in hospitality. Also, you should try to have lunch/dinner at the hotel. The training restaurants are also at this location. We had the opportunity to have dinner there one night and it was a great meal.

216,"I stayed for a week on business in the Holiday Inn Express Kowloon East. It is conveniently located close to the Tseung Kwan O MTR station, about 8 stops and a change of train from Causeway Bay, Wanchai, etc.The room and bathroom are basic, but pleasant. The staff are friendly. But the facilities are just terrible. You have to ask for an iron and ironing board and wait for ages. There is no room service. There is no restaurant or bar in the hotel.However, the breakfast was the final straw. It was served in the neighbouring Crowne Plaza. But not in the Crowne Plaza's own restarant, but in a conference hall where you are treated like the poor cousins of thre proper guests. The food was ghastly. Rubber frankfurters, congealed scrambled eggs. No meat or cheese, no dim sum. Just horrible. It was the worst breakfast I have had outside Russia. After the first morning, I refused to go again and waited until lunch at work.","July 2, 2019","4    Holiday Inn Express HONG KONG KOWLOON EAST

You'll experience Hong Kong but give you the option of less of the hustle and bustle downtown; most of the major stores downtown are at the mall below the hotel so staying here does give you that choice. The MTR station is also directly below so if you did want to go downtown, you're no more than 30 minutes away. The elevator traffic could be improved; only 2 of the 3 seem to be actively serving the guest floors. My suggestion: let 2 serve all floors and the other one exclusively for guests; that'll solve a lot of issues with the restaurants on the floors below also being served by the same set of elevators.","February 3, 2019","4    Holiday Inn Express HONG KONG KOWLOON EAST

245,"This is one of my favorite hotels because I am a frequent visitor to Hong Kong,  I have been here twice, each time over 10 days. I am an IHG member and also stayed in the same hotel brand in the USA frequently. It's at a convenient location, takes only 30 mins to Central or TST by subway. Breakfast provided, don't expect too much but it's much better than the same hotel chain in the USA, with varieties of Asian congee/bun and American pastry/fruit and salad. Staff is polite and friendly, and provide me with a small fridge/adaptor, etc when I request. But there is room for improvement:1) long waiting time for elevators. It usually takes 5-10 mins, but the last day I checked out, it took over 15+ mins2) too long time to check out. I waiting almost 30 mins at the line on Oct 29th at noon for my turn. I realized some were using cash / Alipay or weChat pay. Could the procedure be streamlined? eg. in N America, the bill is distributed under the door/or viewed at TV/etc. Checkout is simply drop in the card and go. There should be one line for ""express checkout"" where the credit card is on file, another for cash/weChat/Alipay checkout. Imagine we usually need to catch the flight home, and long waiting time on last day before flight agitates us. I don't usually write on TripAdvisor but I really like this hotel brand and look for improvement!","October 30, 2018","4    Holiday Inn Express HONG KONG KOWLOON EAST

258,"Stayed here for a week to visit family who are in North Point. The hotel is above the shopping mall and the MTR station, so that was a plus. The only downside for us is the commute to get there and travelling back and forth on the Island line. Also to get to the hotel, you either have to take the airport express then change to the Island line (blue line) then to the Po Lam line (purple line); take the A29P bus, which starts at 11:15am and runs every hour; or take the taxi. Both bus and taxi take about 80-90 minutes depending on traffic.The room itself was quite spacious - we booked a queen standard, stayed on level 19, and the room had a sitting bench against the window. Aircon is always blasting, and the minimum is set at speed 2 (I couldn't set it to the lowest speed for perhaps a user issue!). Cleaning staff are great, you can replace the sheets as often as you like by placing a card there to indicate how often you'd like them to change it.Just note that there is no fridge if you want to store anything, only a kettle with some instant coffee, milk powder, teas are provided. Free wifi in the room was reasonably fast, there is an office work station with the LAN cable.There is a self-service laundry for ~HKD 60, washer & dryer near the lounge area on level 8, check out the view!Breakfast is at the Crowne Plaza, which can be accessed across the valet driveway. There is a range of Western and Chinese choices and if you're an IHG member, you can get a few extra perks. Just be conscious that there are a lot of tourist groups who check in, and the lifts connect to the shopping mall, so you may have to wait a while to get up and down.","August 2, 2018","4    Holiday Inn Express HONG KONG KOWLOON EAST

259,"We stayed for 1 week at this hotel. We found reception staff are friendly. Room amenities are better than expected. Cleaning staff are excellent. They moved furniture and turned bed and lounge chairs for thorough vacuum - which is pretty unusual and commendable. Room size is reasonably big. Our room got the view of Junk Bay and the eastern part of Hong Kong Island. Since it is above MTR Station and the Popcorn Shopping Mall, it is very convenient to find restaurants and retail shops. You need to rely on MTR or taxi if you arrive Hong Kong Airport before 11am. Airport Bus A29P service is only run hourly at 10 minutes to the hour from Tseung Kwan O and 10 minutes past the hour from the Airport. It takes nearly 90 minutes. There are lots of Chinese mainlanders everywhere. Breakfast is served at various rooms at Crowne Plaza in the adjacent building. Choices for breakfast are standard but limited. IHG members dine in a separate zone, but is always overcrowded. Additional machine brewed coffee and pastries are supplied. If you need to take MTR to Hong Kong Island frequently, you need to consider the transport costs. Overall, it is situated in a location serviced well by MTR. Staff are friendly and excellent. General cleanliness is excellent and cleaning staff are friendly and polite. If free Airport Shuttle Bus services this hotel, I would have no doubt to rate it a 5 stars instead of 4. Something for the hotel to negotiate.","July 31, 2018","4    Holiday Inn Express HONG KONG KOWLOON EAST

A mixup left us with the wrong bed configuration -- and no means to correct it, we were told....-- and generally front office staff were pretty unhelpful or unknowledgeable when it came to recommendations in the area and answers to hotel policy. In-house restaurants (which are managed and billed separately) are pretty good, and air con was nice during a very warm stay.

Great location (above shopping mall), friendly and helpful staff and comfortable bed are the main positives. A staff member even recognised us from last year when we went to have breakfast. This did make us feel welcome. A couple of minor negatives (i) the TV in our room was very old with blurry display which also had the wrong screen ratio. But that is ok for us as we only sleepy there. (ii) The hotel is popular with Chinese tourists but they are often loud and rude. I know this is a cultural thing but it can be annoying.

263,"Whilst the hotel isn't close to the centre of everything it is about 1 minutes walk from the MTR (Subway) which allows you to get to everything quite conveniently. I visited friends at the far end of the MTR Tracks opposite direction to the hotel and it took about 1hr 20mins but that is the extreme. It only takes 20 -30mins to get to the heart of Central so easy to get to all of the tourist attractions. The hotel was clean, tidy, and quiet (I stayed during a public holiday so there were many people). The staff were friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast was adequate but it was the same everyday, it would have been nice to have a slight change in what was offered each day. The hotel is attached to the popcorn mall a large multi building shopping complex which had plenty of food and shopping options. There is a bus from the airport to the hotel A29P which stops just next to the Crowne Plaza that is adjoining the Holiday Inn Express. This bus cost $42HKD.

My toddler ended up bumping the sides a lot, causing disrupted sleep.3) The breakfast was great, but I was rather disappointed that their baby chairs were mostly without straps. It took a lot of effort for the staff to look for one with functional straps.","June 22, 2019","5    Novotel Hong Kong Nathan Road Kowloon

282,"We were disappointed with the Novotel. The lounge bar area is nice and enjoyed a couple of drinks there but our room was small and outdated. The curtains were very much needing replacing and the paintwork tired. The carpet in the corridors were torn, had large uneven bumps as you walk along and large stains. No assistance to get our large suitcases down escalators upon leaving. We would say this was the only negative experience with accommodation with our trip thru Asia.

285,The Novotel is in a great spot. Right on Nathan Road which is the central north/south axis of Kowloon. It’s just a few minutes from Jordan MTR station which is a hub of this amazingly efficient transport system and the markets are an easy stroll.

290,"I've stayed in Novotels in other countries but this one was an utter disappointment. The least this hotel could have done was to have a welcoming staff in order to stand out from the HKG 'crowd' (if you know what I mean). But right from the outset it was disappointment for us. The staff just doesn't bother if you are traveling with a 2 year kid, exhausted from a 9 hour flight. For them 2 pm check in is 2 pm check in with no empathy at all (well except for a few guests from the same region who came after us but were given rooms before us and we had to repeatedly ask them if they can give us a room. The answer was NO even at 1.55 pm and suddenly at 2 pm they are ready with the keys?) Rooms are in poor condition, wallpaper coming out, electrical controls giving up. Nowhere near novotel standards.During check one lady staff told I had to make a security deposit of HKD 1000 (who does this nowadays anyway?) and whether I would like to do so by cash or card. I said I will do in cash aftet I withdraw from the ATM. later I changed my mind and approached another staff to tell I will pay security deposit by card and he tells me sure, it is HKD 500!!! Lol or wtf you decide.They gave a complimentary toy (small soft toy) to my kid as part of their so called novotel ""family"" (as if they really cared) and when my 2 year kid lost it and I asked the reception if they can give the kid another one, they gave me such a disgusting look and asked for my room and stay details as if I have asked for buying out the property!! The only plus point is the location but the terrible hospitality of the hotel staff eclipsed everything else about this hotel. You may be better off at other properties. Wouldn't recommend at all.

291,"Location is very good, rooms clean and serviced well each day so at least the most important things were good. Rooms are small though.Check in was a bit of a disaster, as it so happened many guests who got off a cruise ship were all checking in early and at the same moment. Difficult time for the front desk staff but they really did not handle things very well. We were entitled to priority check in due to our Accor Member status and we could not get near the desk as other non priority guests were being served, I guess to try and clear the big line.When we eventually got to front of the line it was then 9.30am we were at first very happy despite the wait as we were promised our room would be ready by just after 12.00pm, (normal check in is 2.00pm) so we went and had a coffee (our bags were with bell staff on first floor) and then went to explore the surroundings. Got back at 1.00pm and still a big line and were told sorry your room is not ready yet, try again at 2.00pm. A little frustrating but we understood, no big deal so went and had a drink at the bar and spoke to many guests waiting for their room, some were Accor members most were not and all were complaining as they also had been promised their rooms by now. Went to desk again at 2.00pm - sorry still not ready. Then at 3.00pm a lady came over and spoke to what was now a big group in the bar and said your rooms are ready. - All of a sudden at least 12 rooms were ready, surely many of these were ready earlier. Of course the 12 of us had to line up again to get our key cards etc. Not good enough for so called priority check in.Another time, my wife left breakfast before me and I did not have my key card with me, you need the card to operate the lift so I could not get to our floor to knock on our door. I used the house phone to explain and was asked my room number and name and was told by the operator that no one by my name was registered in that room and to go to the front desk. You guessed it - big line once more. No problem getting a key card once I got to front of line but hey I was not happy. Front office staff said they would speak to the operator - That did not help me though.Breakfast buffet was OK but nothing special. A la carte dinner service was also slow, meals always took a long time to come out. When they did arrive they were very good quality and decent size servings so that partly made up for the wait.Staff were generally pleasant but appeared to be understaffed as they were always run off their feet.It is doubtful we would stay at that hotel again.","June 6, 2019","5    Novotel Hong Kong Nathan Road Kowloon

( I did online check in and there was a message that my room key will be ready upon my arrival). Then at about 11, I came back and the same girl say that the room is still not ready and told me that she already told the House Keeping . I was pretty upset. Then a few minutes later Jackie came over to with the room keys and apologized for the delayed. She saved the day. The first was not apologetic. She sound like the housing keep was at fault. Nevertheless, I did had a wonderful stay at Novotel Nathan. Catherine at the executive lounge was very friendly and always smiling.

301,"Lately the competition for reasonable hotels in the Jordan/upper Nathan Road area has become fierce, what with lots if revamped and newer hotels in the area. The Eaton just finished a major renovation. Their rooms at around 14sqm are tiny though newly designed and that hotel has a newer, hipper vibe. Hotel Stage which is around the the corner from Novotel and Eaton is more sleek and luxe—but you pay for the look and not much else. I think Novotel strikes a great balance in getting size 24sqm and style right. This was my first stay here and certainly one I’ll be checking out during my frequent trips to HK. First, location: less than 100m from Jordan station. The airport bus A21 also stops right by the corner (at 33 hkd that’s unbeatable if you don’t mind the 50minute ride). The Airport shuttle bus also passes by if you take the Airtrain. At 90hkd plus about a 20-30 minute drive via shuttle to the hotel, I say the bus is better value both to and from the airport IF you have small to little baggage. There are lots of places to eat in around the area and the shopping in nearby Tsimshatsui is incomparable. Service wise, I was given a free upgrade by the very warm and welcoming assistant manager Sanki. She very kindly allowed us early check in and even free lounge access. This may have something to do with booking direct via the Accor site. Membership is free and obviously comes with perks and benefits! The prices on their site were lower than Booking.com so do have a check. It was all warm welcome and smiles all around, something Hk isn’t always known for so this was quite refreshing. Breakfast at the lounge was a more basic and relaxing quiet affair. The main breakfast room is huge and can get raucous with people, though the choices are more plentiful. I tried each one and since I prefer a quiet start, it’s the lounge for me. Rooms are spic and span with slightly larger space than most other hotels in this class. The bed was very comfortable. Housekeeping was prompt and polite. Not much tv entertainment channels but carries the main news in several languages. Bathroom was serviceable and lit very well with everything you could possible need. A few things weren’t renewed though like the vanity kit but other than that not much else amiss. Temperature could be easily adjusted and WiFi was a joy to use. Gym was very well equipped and a great place to use. Wish there was a pool but I’m sure this would drive up their price. All in all an above average stay, and with check out available at the lounge, things couldn’t be easier. If you don’t mind staying up further up Nathan, being surrounded by great eateries and local color, this is the hotel for you. ","May 15, 2019","5    Novotel Hong Kong Nathan Road Kowloon

If you're looking for superior value, this is where to stay. What you get is a clean and comfortable room, a convenient location for subway connections to all the main neighborhoods, and if you get the breakfast buffet option (which I highly recommend), a multicultural daily spread of an array of choices for a hearty filling breakfast to start your busy day. Even though I end up in the Central district to see friends sometimes, this hotel is still the most convenient (as compared to some very pricey options) because Central is actually just 10-15 minutes away by subway -- it actually takes longer from many hotels on the Hong Kong side.","May 5, 2019","5    Novotel Hong Kong Nathan Road Kowloon

We had to push them ourselves.CHECK INThe process was smooth, the staff was polite but not welcoming, not smiling. I noticed that the countertop was dusty. I wiped it with my finger to confirm it was really dust and not just a design of the surface. We checked in at 7pm and when I asked for a late checkout, I was given 13:00.ROOMI’d say, for the published tariff rate/cost, the room size and amenities didn’t match (it is very costly!). We got a generous king sized bed as advertised but the space around it, especially the front was really tight. I can’t push the luggage through it, it has to be pushed sideways. All other furniture (desk, nite stands), were built-in type to save space. The closet and bathroom share the same sliding door. If someone is using the bathroom and you open the closet, the person won’t be able to come out at will unless you slide it out and it closes the closet. The hanger area is too far inside that it was a challenge to hang clothes. The bathroom is also tight. The lavatory counter is right beside the toilet seat.A safe is provided, iron, ironing board and the usual stuff. The slippers are so thin they tear easily. At least for the price we paid, the slippers could have been fluffy and durable. But they are replaced daily.Along with the drawer for making coffee and tea, a condom is displayed with the Pringles! Of course with a price tag. It’s the first time I saw a condom displayed and made available along with the minibar pricelist. I was concerned that our young child would see it! Maybe having it in the pricelist is enough but not display it upfront.QUALITY OF SLEEPIt was good, however we could hear the other guests walking and talking along the hallway. The window has a sheer curtain plus a blackout shade which was good. We actually slept in and missed our breakfast.ENTERTAINMENT The TV provided a variety of English channels to watch. In the lobby there’s an area for children to hangout and use their computers. Unlike in other Novotel Hotels, the play option is varied.BREAKFASTThere was a queue getting in because the staff recording the room numbers is the same to usher the guests to their tables so there was waiting time until she comes back. Food choices offered a variation and there were a lot of fruits, cheeses, fish, meat, bread, drinks varieties which also offered choices for young guests.CHECKOUT It was very quick. I noticed that my fingerprint was still there. The countertop was not wiped since I checked in two days ago.Good concierge service though coz our flight was late at night. We left our luggage for some shopping time.LOCATIONIt is the main reason guests have chosen this hotel despite the cost and tight space. It is walking distance to the Temple Street Night Market, the bus stops, Jordan MTR station and shopping places in Mongkok. Everything is within reach. There’s a mall across Nathan Road, Starbucks within the block, and money changers.","April 22, 2019","5    Novotel Hong Kong Nathan Road Kowloon

317,"We had a great stay here. The room nicely decorated, and was a decent size with a lovely big, soft bed. The bathroom was good and the shower was powerful. The hotel staff were polite and helpful, and everything was clean and tidy. Only mild issues was the drain was a little slow and it made the floor wet after taking a shower. The TV was also a little old and could be updated. It would also be convenient to have some USB ports in the room to charge phones and stuff. But these are just very mild issues.Take exit B1 from Jordan MTR to be sure you are on the right side of the road for the hotel. It’s only a few minutes walk which is great for exploring the city. There’s also a 711 opposite the hotel which was helpful to pick up late night snacks or milk for coffee. Overall, great hotel! Perfect for enjoying a holiday in Hong Kong!

Not a massive fan of the downstairs breakfast area, and chose the Club lounge more often than not for my morning meal. The club lounge staff and setting was really good excepting no toilet in club lounge... quick trip back to room required.... but overall a cracking club lounge to drink eat and meet people, albeit on the smaller side.

320,"Was underwhelmed by welcome but delighted with room which was very comfortable.The hotel is in Kowloon very central, handy for underground and easy walk to Star Ferry. Plenty of restaurants close by. Temple Market just across the road.Breakfast was good with plenty of choices. We didn't eat in restaurant at night but did have a bite in the bar which was good. Disappointed in bar however. During Happy hour one night we ordered a pint and a half of beer. For some reason that didn't qualify for buy one get one free? For that we would have had to order 2 pints. If we had done that I would have only had to pay for one pint. As it was I had to pay for 1 pint and a premium price on the half pint. Given what we had already spent on the hotel for accommodation, food and drink it left a bit of a sour taste and cost the waiter a tip.Overall whilst we did have some great service there were some failings along the way.","April 17, 2019","5    Novotel Hong Kong Nathan Road Kowloon

324,"First of all, I am a true fan of the hotel which have stayed for nearly 10 times in the recent 6 months. And I used to work in the hotel industry. Bedding, room, swimming pool, gym, especially the staff are really good. If you are not staying at the club floor or going to use the lounge, you can skip the below. The only downside that I want to share is the arrangement of executive lounge. (1) Bad crowd control: You will have to queue up at entrance (if you are disciplined as no one at counter). Some guests have to stand/ sit at the computer area. No one check your room number so literally saying - anyone can just come in and enjoy the service at the lounge. (2) Quite a lot of kids: May be due to the hotel is a family friendly hotel and no kids policy at the lounge. No offence as I love kids as well. But I do not think it is a good decision to allow kids in club lounge especially in happy hour session (alcohols, glasses, bottles are everywhere). Especially, the area in this lounge is not that big. (3) Staffing: The staffs are all very helpful, if we able to locate them. Take 6:30pm-7:30pm cocktail peak time, all 3 full-time (+ 1 causal probably) are serving a full-house lounge. Filling up food drinks and cleaning the dishes occupy most of their time. The management should look more into the staffing issue. And I strongly suggest at least having 1 staff at counter as crowd control is very important. The above are some of my personal sharing. I can’t control whether there would be a change. But if the management take the Marriott brand and service standard seriously, I do hope these can be improved in the upcoming future.","July 13, 2019","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

327,"After staying here once in Jan of 2018, I decided to stay here again recently because of the great service and big and clean rooms.Location isn’t center but they have free shuttles to downtown and there’s a bus stop right there. Not super convenient but the rooms make up for it.Last time I stayed, I booked the Deluxe Double and although the floor we got wasn’t high, the view was still nice and rooms were super big, which is the main reason why I booked it again this time. I didn’t get an upgrade before because I was only a silver member but I am now a Gold elite so I was expecting an upgrade. Jacky told me I got an upgrade but I am sure that wasn’t the case. I did get a higher floor but once I walked in, immediately I knew the room was smaller. Not to mention, the beds too. Because of the smaller rooms, and thinner walls, I can hear whenever someone sneezes and even heard when someone was pulling the shades. I didn’t have that problem before when I came here last time.Needless to say, it wasn’t as pleasant as last time because not only did I not get an upgrade, I felt like I got a downgrade lol. I woke up 3 times because of the thin walls whenever someone closed the door.","May 22, 2019","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

332,"Let me share with you a horrible experience at Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin. I stayed at room 2005 on 22 April 2019. After my nap I went into the bathroom to take a shower and I closed the sliding door. Then I realized that I left my underwear out of bathroom, so I tried to open the sliding door, but it did not move at all even though I had tried my best to pull it. More terribly and astonishingly, I looked around the bathroom but fail to find any emergency SOS button or telephone.However, I was at least lucky since I just happened to bring my mobile phone into the bathroom, so I called the hotel service center right away. Then came a housekeeper and a guy who carried my welcome fruit, both of them could not open the door. The housekeeper called the engineering staffs and the front office for help.Duty manager could not open it by himself as well. Finally, several strong men joined forces to pull the bathroom door open.More importantly, as I told the duty manager, the hotel has severe problems with security settings. I was scared when I was trapped in bathroom for no one would know me locked in bathroom even though I shouted for help, if at first I did not bring my mobile phone in. People may die alone in the bathroom, and no one knows he is dying in this situation. Why is there no any SOS alarm buttons or telephone in the bathrooms of your hotel??? How can you make sure that it would never happen that someone slips or gets injured or just like me is trapped in the bathroom? How can the hotel open with such unqualified security settings? How can the hotel pass the security inspection by Hong Kong government and Marriott International? The hotel should be suspended of business immediately so as to rectify the security settings, many people say it including security and legal professional persons who know what I have experienced at Courtyard Sha Tin.After being locked for nearly half an hour, my journey was ruined and my mind was hurt. I was suffering from the SAFETY THREATS and PSYCHIC TRAUMA. So far I still dream with a nightmare that I was locked in the bathroom of Courtyard Sha Tin and no one came to save me, I shouted and shouted but no one hear me. You probably can understand in what kind of dangerous circumstance I was? Isolated and helpless. The management team repeatedly apologized but never present their apologies in an earnest or sincere way, and never made a satisfying compensation. What’s more, after my complaints and a few emails with the resident manager, I do even not see their real action plans they would take to improve their security settings, only some general perfunctory words like “Safety of guests is the top priority of our hotel, we have conducted examination and taken necessary precautions to eliminate the influence, in the hope of preventing similar issues from happening again” blablabla, never mention that they would install the necessary bathroom telephone or SOS Emergency button. Therefore, I do not suggest you stay at Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin for your own safety.","April 30, 2019","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

333,"This is our first time experiencing the Courtyard Shatin as it is close to where my husband’s family lives. We contacted the hotel Front desk assistant manager several times, Jacky Chan, about an upgrade because we are Gold Bonvoy members. He was resistant and very unwilling to acknowledge our gold member status. On the day of check in, we again asked and he refused an upgrade despite a studio suite being available. We were appalled by his actions that I demanded to speak to the Resident Manager. At this time, the hotel’s Assistant Manger, Nicole Chan, came out and kindly resolved the upgrade issue by offering us an upgrade for being Gold members. As loyal Marriott members, we should not need to beg for an upgrade because it is one of the advantages of being a gold Bonvoy member. This benefit should be offered to all Marriott members instead of holding rooms iso upgrading its members and that is what Mr. Jacky Chan did. It is shameful to have employees like him representing the Bonvoy brand!We paid for an executive club lounge room so our upgraded room was a Studio suite which can fit an extra bed with enough room to move around. Thank you to Ms. Nicole Chan for taking a pro-active approach in resolving an ugly situation. Our upgraded room, unfortunately, had a very strong smoke odour from the previous guests smoking illegally in the room. I am asthmatic so the smoke smell worsened my condition. I did not want to complain because it took so much out of me already with the upgrade issue. We stayed only 4 nights so I just had to use my inhalers more during our stay.Our room 1223 is a good size with good duvets and comfortable beds. The carpeting is clean as is the washroom but the chaise lounge is stained and should have been cleaned. Some of the furnishings have taken a beating. It was handy to have a safe in the room as well as a fridge and kettle. Th hotel has complimentary shuttle that brings guests to Tsimshatsui every 75 minutes or so and the trip takes about 40 minutes. We found this service very helpful and convenient. There is a McDonalds next to the hotel as well as a Circle K that sells noodles and fresh pastries. In addition, outside the hotel is Wellcome, a little supermarket and a Chinese coffee shop, Wah Kee, that has great breakfasts and lunches. The executive lounge is okay with a small selection of breakfast but if you prefer a larger buffet breakfast then go to Momo Cafe downstairs along with other Conference attendees and the crowd. The food selection at Momo Cafe is extensive but the food quality is mediocre. We only had time during our 4 night stay to utilize the executive lounge once during happy hour because we were always out. From 5:30 to 7:30 pm canapés are served like cheeses, cookies, gyozas, little desserts, cucumber rolls, but again the food quality and the taste of the food is below average. The one time we were there, I had a gin and tonic but they ran out of gin so we had to find alternative alcoholic drinks. It is tacky to run out of alcohol especially when it is a lounge serving drinks!The pool is very clean but also very cold as it is outdoors and not heated. The steam room is very clean and large along with a smaller dry sauna. The showers and changing area are all spic and span. The only inconvenience is that the pool closes for one hour from 1 to 2 pm, smack in the middle of the day. I think perhaps it is the towel attendant/life guard’s lunch break?I gave this property a generous 4 stars because of the cleanliness of the fitness and pool areas and the comfortable beds/duvets but this particular Courtyard has lots to learn from North American Courtyards in how to value its members and in offering friendly guest services. If you are expecting North American Courtyard standards, then this property will disappoint.In the future, I hope all staff at Courtyard Shatin gets proper training about the importance of valuing Bonvoy members and we the members earned this privilege by being loyal to the Bonvoy brand when there are many other competitors we can select from,","April 6, 2019","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

First, checked in at 22:30 on my birthday and indicated at the time of reservation, my ID was shown and registered, but the check in colleague never realised nor said anything relevant, or he did not bothered to? I don’t know. Well, second we were checked into a room which the double lock never worked, and this room also surprised us with a very lovely handwritten card that never had my name on...Mr. Lok? alright, so it was my birthday and I was checked into someone’s room? Called to request for another room so the right person could have this room back.. 20 minutes later I was switched to a room with another lovely card on the table, so hopefully this time everything was right.. or maybe wow me with a simple word of happy birthday? Noway. Not even a correct spelling of my last name, which was as obvious as stated on the paper of my registration, not to mention you were already welcoming me back so you should know my name pretty well on your system?I’ve decided to put it aside as it was a birthday celebration. Breakfast buffet at momo cafe was okay with variety of options, but the fact that you need to go to the bar counter to order the coffee by yourself and then retrieve the coffee yourself again when it’s done still weirded me out. Pretty disappointed with your name affiliated with the Marriott..I know you are quite reasonably priced with the facilities you provided. Stayed in budget hotels before in HK and service was still better. I still think there are rooms in the humanity part you should fix. Maybe ASAP. ","March 11, 2019","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

Rooms were clean, comfortable and with great views. Bed however was too soft for my liking.Service was also prompt and friendly. Food-wise the all day dining restaurant had a great variety - I was pleasantly surprised to find some local treats like egglets, portuguese egg tarts in the options. In-room dining however was a little sub-par was it was tasteless. However do note that there is nothing in the area to explore as it is a residential area. Taking a train down to the city takes awhile too and taxi is very expensive. Will only recommend for business travel, in the hotel itself.","February 6, 2019","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

344,"My mother and I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Hong Kong Sha Tin for 2 nights while I was attending a conference in the area. So to speak, our stay was for both leisure/family and business, and this hotel was a great choice, away from the noise and crowd of the Hong Kong main districts. The hotel was very clean and with a spacious lobby. Waiting for check-in was just fine because there was continuous flow of complementary nuts, cookies, cold coffee and tea in the waiting lounge. The rooms were big and with adequate space for movement and for luggage. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The airconditioning system, hot shower water and wifi were functioning. We were lucky enough to have a room with nice, relaxing view of the city and mountains in the background. There was a pool as well as a gym/fitness center with equipment for both cardio and strength exercises. Right across the street was a convenience store, and right in the hotel ground were a supermarket and cosmetics store. There were also a number of taxis waiting outside the hotel entrance so transportation was easy. Uber was also readily available.The people at the reception spoke basic English so it was not too difficult to communicate. We tried the room service and it was fast. The room service staff were courteous, and the food was good. Buffet breakfast at the MoMo Cafe offered a good spread of both Oriental/Chinese and Western dishes. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my relatives and friends who are planning to visit Sha Tin and the New Territories.","January 25, 2019","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

The room rate is also quite decent as there is train to Mongkok and later this year there will be direct train to Kowloon area. It is definitely a hotel location worth a consideration if you plan to travel to Shen Zhen and Kowloon during a visit to Hong Kong.","January 23, 2019","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

Bus A41P from airport stops at the opposite side of the road, so the bus stop going back to the airport is just in front. Rooms are spacious. I would have to say the staff from the gym would be great in the front desk as they were very warm and welcoming. Shuttle from the hotel to TST or MongKok is on the dot, but make sure you queue early as it is first come and first served.

Alternatively download their walking map as it's only about 10 minutes walk from the nearest MTR. The hotel itself is modern and well kept. Borderline luxurious as well. The rooftop bar can be on the dearer side of this part of town but view is indeed breathtaking for those who enjoy a getaway from the city.

350,"I booked a room in this hotel for four nights, I was able to use my free night certificate, and some MR points so that it works out to paying one night.Pros: big room for Hong Kong, close to metro Shek Mun, free shuttle bus to central Hong Kong (need to wait 10 minutes ahead) by doors at front reception. It’s about 45 minutes to central Hong Kong by metro and 30 minutes by shuttle bus to Kowloon Station (bullet train). Shower pressure is excellent. Facilities are very clean and new. Very quiet, and front desk are very nice and attentive, and can speak English proficiently.Cons: everything in this hotel costs money. The breakfast works out to 198HKD per person. The drawer with snacks and ramen you think are free costs 30HKD and above. And the prices are hidden, price list is deep within the drawer.They also charged 3000HKD in pre-authorized costs. That seems to be a bit much when most hotels charge like one night hotel cost.Hotel is located really close to McDonald’s, so walk past Wellcome supermarket and you’re arrive at the hotel, need to go up two flights of escalators to get to front desk.A41P stops in front of hotel (to airport) and across the street (Ravana Garden, from Airport). We took A41P to HKG airport and front desk gave me a schedule and told me to add 10-15 minutes from schedule’s time (as it only shows first stop time) so it works out to approximately the bus will come at :00 and :30. A41P takes Octopus card, costs 27HKD from Airport and 22.3HKD to airport.","December 10, 2018","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

353,"We stayed at this Courtyard for 2 nights in October 2018. We picked this hotel due to location — this is the closest Marriott property to my family. This is not your standard-US Courtyard property — this hotel is new and beautiful with a grand lobby - something you expect to see at a Marriott Marquis in the US. The location is convenient for my purpose - it is also a 30-minute bus ride from the airport (the bus drops you off right across the street). The hotel also offers a free shuttle that takes you to TST/back to the hotel from TST. This is pretty amazing. I didn’t dine at the hotel but there are many (local) dining options about 5-10 minutes’ walk, by the train station. The guest rooms are very spacious and modern (again, not your standard-US Courtyard rooms). It has a nice gym and even a rooftop pool. I would absolutely recommend this hotel (if you look to stay in the area), and would go back.So why 3 stars? I have 1 gripe — and it’s a big one: we chose a Marriott property because we are Marriott members and towards end of the year we are collecting points to get to Platinum status. Since we got home (over a month at this point) we haven’t been credited the nights we stayed at this property. We contacted Marriott numerous times, starting by submitting missing stay request online, and then calling in to customer service 2x, to no avail. We did provide our Marriott number at check-in so I really don’t understand why this is so difficult. ","November 25, 2018","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

354,"Our room up 20+ floors was very good as we had an amazing view of the river in Sha Tin. The staff were very pleasant and very welcoming. The room was well-appointed with all the usual things you would expect in a Marriott. The international breakfast offered a very good choice for all and the catering staff were very good to ensure the place was clean and tidy for the many guests. The hotel was very convenient for a metro station a few minutes walk down the road. There are plenty of shops nearby and the hotel shuttle, or frequent taxis, can take you into the main town centre to the mall for serious shopping. Minor criticism - the Club Lounge did not really offer much in the way of food. Alcoholic drinks were limited and unfortunately, I was not given information about what was going to be available and when. The service was average and impersonal. The views were very good though I've had much better experiences in other club lounges in other hotels. Buses were also very convenient, a short walk from the hotel main entrance. One bus goes directly to the airport.","November 21, 2018","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

Courtyard Marriott provides free shuttle service (there is a timetable provided) for pickups and drop offs. I thought that was a nice surprise and delight!The free shuttle bus ride was a bit hectic. We are not too use with the fast driving here in Hong Kong hehe. So, we opted for the local public transport the next day. It was only 7 minutes to Shek Mun station. It’s also a local hot spot for snacks and eateries. A nice and small selection, but we are happy with that.Everything is nice and clean. Lovely pool to swim in. Pleasant and friendly staff.

Staff are polite, although not everyone conversant in English, the concierge are helpful, special thanks to Andy and Alex. Will only stay if we need be back to Shatin area, but won’t recommend for tourists( kind of far from all sites), nor for luxe/comfort ( smaller room with relatively basic offers).

LOCATION: Sha tin is a bit far from the traditional tourist places. However, the hotel provides a convenient shuttle service to Tsim Sha Tsui (to and from), and the ride takes only 35 minutes or so. A bus schedule is also provided for the main tourist sites. Public transportation is clean, cheap, and super easy to navigate.ACCESS FROM/TO AIRPORT: take bus A41P from Arrival. HKD 27.7 (USD 3.5). Get off at the 3rd stop: Ravana Garden. The hotel is directly across the street. Super easy.Stops are announced in English and Chinese.ROOM: good size for Hong Kong. Excellent open view. Modern and new. Bed very comfortable. A/C works well (important as Hong Kong is hot and humid). Wifi fast.RESTAURANT: breakfast spread has extensive Western and Chinese food items. Restaurant usually busy in the morning.EXECUTIVE LOUNGE: crowded in the evenings. Evening snacks include hot food, enough for a dinner substitute. Has excellent view of the city.NEARBY: has a super market (Wellcome) and a Manning (similar to Walgreen's) on the ground floor. A Circle-K (similar to 7-11) across the street. Has ATM by the entrance. No restaurant nearby except for a McDonald's but the free hotel shuttle can send you to a nearby mall which is super big with tons of restaurants.SERVICE: warm and friendly.Overall this is a great property and an excellent value especially if you are Marriott Gold or Platinum. I have two suggestions:1) Check in & out were very slow. Each transaction took 5-10 minutes! We stood in line for 30+ minutes each time.2) It's obvious to me that non-guests took advantage of the free shuttle! On return trips from the mall, many ladies with big suitcases got on. They are professional ""buyers"" for mainland customers and fill empty suitcases with purchases at the mall. They are not staying at the hotel and simply get off at the hotel and move on.","July 30, 2018","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

The rooms are large and quite comfortable.The hotel is located in Sha Tin which is fine if you are visiting the Chinese University of Hong Kong but it is quite a distance to Hong Kong (60 mins).The hotel staff are very friendly and clearly well trained. I received a complimentary upgrade (status related) which I appreciated. I also received a welcome gift which was unexpected but a nice touch.The room amenities are standard and functional. I was pleasantly surprised to see bathrobes provided which is typically not the case for a Courtyard hotel. It was a little odd to find bathrobes but not slippers provided in the room. Perhaps it was an oversight.Elite members receive complimentary access to lounge (which was quite large and comfortable) and complimentary breakfast.","June 16, 2018","6    Courtyard Hong Kong Sha Tin

As Sha Tin is far away from the city center, make sure when you select this property, you only stay here for work in the places near by. Property is great and staff is hospitable. Service is good.

Very near Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station, 7-11, and a lot of dining choices along the street. There's also a nearby international supermarket. And for Filipinos like us, Jollibee is very nearby as well! :)The room is what we expected, based on the photos we've seem online, so no surprise there. Despite the small space, we slept comfortably. Shower is a bit tiny, but it'll do. Plus, free instant coffee and warm/cold water in the common area.If you will just use the room to sleep in and shower, this is the perfect location for you. Will definitely book here again when we come back! ","February 19, 2019","7    Inn Spirit

380,"This is NOT my first time stopping at this wonderful guesthouse and certainly won’t be my last. This is without a doubt a great find and I have stopped here with both friends and family on numerous occasions.The location is 10/10, 5 minutes from Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station, Kowloon Park and Nathan Road, in a street packed full of some of the best restaurants in Kowloon. You are spoilt for choice with retail here also (Marks and Spencer is across the road.) If you are thinking of getting jewellery made, Hong Kong is the place, and there are 2 top jewellers within a block of Inn Spirit. (Allow as much time as possible for manufacturing )At the airport purchase an Octopus Card immediately for public transport at the Service desk (THIS IS A MUST) If you’re over 65 years of age purchase a Seniors Octopus card. Load the card with a few hundred $ HK . (Money on the card is fully refundable at the end of your visit.)From the airport to the guesthouse it’s less than an hour, and is an easy, stress free commute. Take the Airport Express train from the airport and get off at Kowloon Station. Take the FREE K2 bus (leaves every 12 minutes) to the third stop at the rear of the Peninsula Hotel. Walk up Nathan Road for 5 minutes to Peking Road (on the left) and turn left here. The first street on the right is Lock Road.The guesthouse is on the left-hand side of the street. Keep walking until you see the yellow FIRE PLUG on the footpath. This is the entrance, too easy!! Take the lift to the 6th floor.You’ll be welcomed on arrival by the delightful owners Samuel and Fanny. Nothing is too much trouble to explain or sort for this dynamic couple. It’s like staying with family, they make you feel so very comfortable.The guesthouse has 8 rooms of different sizes from singles to doubles to family, and is on the top floor of an apartment block with retail at ground level. Its secure, modern, spotlessly clean and a good night’s sleep is guaranteed on their uber comfortably firm mattresses. Their bathroom provides the best hot shower after a full day of sightseeing. There’s crisp white linen, clean towels daily, shampoo, liquid soap, hairdryer, air con and a TV (with English station.) You’ve access to a communal hot/cold water fountain with complimentary tea and coffee facilities and any plates or cutlery you require. The rooms aren’t big but that’s Hong Kong (even in 5 star.) If you are after an affordable place to stay in the best location this is it. If you want a bigger room, go 5 star at $900 AUD a night where you’ll get another few feet. The choice is yours. If you are budget conscious and want to enjoy the finer things Hong Kong has to offer like High Tea at the Peninsula, or a beverage or two at Ozone Bar (above Kowloon station in the Park Hyatt Hotel, commute there on the K2 free bus) save your $ and stay here.The China Ferry Terminal (to Macau) is a 10-minute walk from Lock Road at the end of Kowloon Park and if you are cruising from Ocean Terminal it’s only a short distance on foot also from this address.Don’t miss the Cheung Hing Kee- Shanghai pan fried pork bun restaurant (opposite) for their fabulous Michelin starred take away buns in 4 packs. (The truffle buns are to die for!!!! and don’t underestimate how many you can eat,) or the great restaurants on the ground level under the guesthouse with their mouth-watering Portuguese tarts.Inn Spirit ticks all the boxes for us and you won’t find cheaper or better accommodation anywhere in Hong Kong for the price you’ll pay here. I can’t speak highly enough of the place, and its fabulously central location. Hong Kong is a great destination for a week’s vacation and has too much to offer the tourist.Do yourself a favour, look no further…….. this is it. I have never had any concerns with anything at this property. It’s a great place, just think SMALL and use your room to sleep in not entertain in.","April 4, 2018","7    Inn Spirit

Very reasonably priced compared to other properties and the staff were friendly with good information for finding the place (it is tricky to find the entrance). Location was great and ideal for kowloon and close to ferry to get across to island. The only downside is the rooms are ""Hong kong sized"" i.e. tiny. No problem for me as a solo traveler intending on spending little time in my room but not if you are intending on spending a lot of time in your room and couples will find they will need to juggle the luggage around as there isnt space for more the one suitcase open on the floor.

402,"This is a guesthouse-type of accommodation in HK so basically if you are looking into a decent place to relax and sleep after a tiring activities in the city, but without shelling out too much on room rates, this one is recommendable for the following reasons:Location: Very strategic location. It is situated in Tsim Tsa Tsui area where lots and lots of shopping complexes, shops/bazarres, and affordable restos can be found. You will reach the nearest MRT stn (via I-Square Mall) in just a minute and the Victoria Harbour for about 15 mins by foot.Room: Like most of the typical guesthouses and inns in HK, room is very small and compact that might be of discomfort if you are carrying even a single medium-sized luggage with you.. but there is a wide window, though, that helps remove that kind of claustrophobic feeling. Despite of the tight space, a separate shower and bath is inside equip with daily replacement of fresh towels, big bottles of shower gel and shampoo, and hot-and-cold shower with strong water pressure. A/C is good, no issue with it.. and the wifi, it has a strong and very good signal even inside the room. In fact I found the wifi speed here much faster than the one I had in SG the last time. And one more thing, the room is being housekept daily even if you do not request for it (which is not true for some of the guesthouses around).And its most strong point, for me, is its so helpful and accommodating owner, Mr. Samuel. From the point of booking up to the last day of your stays, he'll always give his very best to assist and help you in any ways to make your stays hassle-free as much as possible. You can approach him anytime.. be it some concerns or some suggestions on how to make the most of your stays in the city.So there.. once your turn comes to visit HK, I recommend to give this place a try.","November 3, 2016","7    Inn Spirit

Less than 10 minutes to HK island by any method of transport!The street has a number of wonderful restaurants in walking distance – breakfast at the Macau restaurant on the 2nd floor was okay (crispy buns with butter and condensed milk!), but I loved the Shanghai pan fried bun stand across the street, Din Tai Fung (Michelin star dim sum) has a location at Silvercord mall on Canton Rd, and Sing Lum Khui noodles next door had the best (and spiciest) noodle soup I had in Asia!

Take the Airport express to Kowloon Station and then take the free bus from there to the Holiday Inn (first stop) and then Locke Street is right across the street near ISquare shopping center. So easy. The location of this hotel was amazing. So close to everything that I wanted, right near the metro, star ferry, shopping, restaurants etc. The room was clean but small but I didn't mind because I was always out and about.

He was full of tips of where to go, how to get there, etc. He helped with everything from transportation to the airport, to where to buy a coat (we visited during an unexpected cold spell). The rooms are small (the bed touched 3 walls), but very cozy. I’m 183 cm and I fit in fine, but much taller and you might not be able to stretch out in the bed. The bathroom was a combined shower, toilet, sink glass box – very efficient use of space. You have your own hot water heater, so showers are always comfortable. The location was amazingly central with lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. You are super close to the metro (get an octopus card).

423,"Our primary goal for our first 3 days in HK was to explore the city, eat, and EAT! We know we were going to spend a lot of time out so we didn't really need to stay in a posh 5-star hotel. Inn Spirit was perfect for my family. A No-frills place, it has comfy beds and very clean t&b. The size of the family room was decent enough to accommodate my family of 4. My son had the single bed while my hubby, myself and our daughter had the queen bed. Multiple power cord with international plug adapters are provided. The entire place has 7 other rooms. I got to peek in one of the rooms and it was spacious as well.All guests have access to cold/hot drinking water, a microwave and a refrigerator. They also have available instant coffee and tea. Inn Spirit also has a good security system. The guests are given a security code to open the main door. A key card and a normal key for the guest room. There is a CCTV camera at the main door for added security. Samuel, the owner, was almost always there to receive & assist his guests. He is very friendly, helpful and polite. We really like the guy! Location-wise, it is perfect for TST area. It's a 5-min walk away from TST station Exit A1. 10min Walking distance from the East TST station. It's near the bus stop - we took the bus from the airport and got off at Middle Road Bus station (5min walk to inn spirit). It's also a 5min walk to DutyFree, Harbour City Mall. 10mins or less walk to Harbour Terminal to see the Symphony of Lights. There are also quite a number of food spots beside the building of the inn. There's a Hui Lai Shan just 12 steps away. Mak's 2 doors away. Try the Macau eggtart and the Fried dumpling (Michelin reco place). My family and I really had a pleasant stay at Inn Spirit. It was a home away from home. I highly recommend this place if you want to stay at TST/Jordan/YMT/Mongkok area. ","March 17, 2016","7    Inn Spirit

Even after I moved to another hotel, Samuel sent me an email telling me about some events that he suggested I should check out!The room itself was very clean and secure. Even though it was small, it was private and as the roof was fairly high, it didn't feel claustrophobic at all. Despite it being in such a busy area, the only noise was from other guests in nearby rooms. The location was fantastic, with the MTR station just across the road and the harbour and ferry terminal within a few minutes.

429,"It's small, it's tricky to find, and you won't get a view. But it's also central, clean, friendly and very well priced.Let's go through those in order: the rooms really are tiny (and the bathrooms more so). This is not a place to go back to relax in - it's a place for sleeping in and then going out for the day. Several people have posted photographs of the entrance; memorize these, as there's no sign. Once you've found it however, you won't have a problem finding it again - it's just the initial hunt! The inn itself is on the sixth floor, but there's a small lift that will take you up. The lift and corridors are on the dingy side, and you may wonder what you've let yourself in for - but don't worry, as once you're in it's a bright and clean oasis!I had a back room, which looked out over... an air conditioning unit. I had a quick peek in one of the rooms out front, which looked out on the street but would likely have had some street noise.And yet, and yet... it's location really can't be beaten, and certainly not at this price. You're really in the middle of everything in Kowloon, with a metro stop about 60 seconds away. Within minutes you'll be at the waterfront, with the Star ferries to Hong Kong Island.The two owners always seemed to be smiling, and on hand to offer information and advice.

It certainly must rate as one of the 'jewels' in Hong Kong with regards to value for money. Don't expect Marriott standards but for the money, the hotel is clean, well run and staffed by very helpful people. The rooms were well tended with daily towel changes and comfortable. The views are not great but this is Hong Kong where tower blocks of flats for the local residents abound. If you want a 'harbour view', expect to pay around £400-500 per night!!

Staff were lovely as usual, breakfast was plentiful and lots of choice. Bit of a bun fight from 9 til 10am with all of the other guests charging between the tables (not much room for elbows) Will stay here again, good value.","April 7, 2019","8    City Garden Hotel

All the staff we met were polite, friendly and helpful, especially Tom in the bar.This hotel is in a residential area, lots of local shops nearby. Lots of Chinese tourists use this hotel. There were events and gala dinners which meant the bar area wasn’t open to other guests which was disappointing on a couple of nights. No bars nearby to get a drink.MTR and tram are less than 5 minutes walk away. About 15 minutes into central on MTR.I would stay here again for price but if you’re looking for a Hong Kong city hotel it may not be for you.

Large windows made the room look bright and cosy. Clean and new, the room is definitely top notch and quiet despite facing the road and on the second floor. Just note that there wasn’t a heater in the room so it may get a little chilly at night but other than that, good room.  However, the staff is what made this place amazing. Firstly, was our 2nd floor house keeper, Anna, who took care of us during our stay. She is detailed and flexible, always providing multiple timings for her turn down services to best suit my family's erratic movements in and out of the hotel. She constantly greets us with a smile. Great impression on housekeeping and the level of cleanliness they provide. Secondly, were the staffs at the reception. Unfortunately, on one of the days, a family member left his phone on a taxi close to midnight on his way back. Upon contacting the reception for help, the manager provided help and support to get the taxi information. In the end, we managed to get the phone back.

A gigantic flat panel TV adorns one of the walls. The efforts of going ""green"" and the reduction of use of plastic containers mean that a carafe is provided for obtaining water from a dispenser in the lift lobby on each floor and a pair of metal insulated mugs are provided. The updated bathrooms have a nice shower but no tub (this serves me just fine but may annoy others who prefer a relaxing soak after a long day out as a tourist); in addition, these City Rooms do not have work desk like the older rooms and there are no doors to the closet space (these are some of the reasons for a 4 instead of 5 stars rating). On the other hand the wifi connections are very stable and the signal strong (a hub is hidden in one of the drawers in the room thus ensuring the quality of the signal).

Signs throughout the MTR stations are ubiquitous and invaluable. I keep staying at the hotel for its superb service, quick, efficient, friendly, not attitudes common in most dense frenetic cities. And with free wifi, free local calls, and all the amenities of international hotels (good toiletries, hairdryer, iron, mini-fridge, kettle, coffee, tea etc packs, bottled water), daily newspaper, it makes more sense to use the hotel rather than a full-service apartment as a base for a long business visit. The superior room is large, with a table/desk, sofa, excellent mattress on a huge king sized bed, a full tub and shower, and very quiet. The towels are thick and fluffy white, the housekeeping good, and there are lots of closets and drawers to make a long stay comfortable. The gym and pool on the second floor are excellent. The hotel is in Shatin, and is linked to multiple malls with literally hundreds of stores and eateries from luxury to middle class; you never need to emerge into a street to shop and eat! The managers on duty are always ready to soothe anxieties and offer assistance. (Ask for Mr. Jan Cheng or Danny Szanto.) In short, I return to the Royal Park Hotel as a business traveler who needs a secure home away from home to do her work.

The house keeping do a great job and i would like to thank Keny Liu for looking after us throughout our stay, always happy, friendly and polite.The doorman who has been there for many years is always polite and friendly helped us with our suitcases to the bus stop.We always prefer to stay in rooms on higher floors.We will be hopefully booking to stay again later this year.","May 18, 2019","9    Royal Park Hotel

503,"We stayed for 7 nights. The room was good size. We had 2 double beds. The pool is pretty good and part of it is outdoor.We were unlucky and stayed on a floor which was very noisy from the cleaning staff (7th floor). Our friends staying on a different floor didn’t encounter the same problem. We had some amenities not replenished properly on some of the days( ie given 4 shampoos and no conditioners, no slippers etc) But a quick call to the housekeeping and it was sorted. The location of the hotel is ok, v close to the train station and shopping centre. But the shopping centre is very busy. We had a really bad experience in the Chinese restaurant called Jade something which is part of the hotel. We had dim sum there and the food was quite good but our experience was totally spoilt from one female staff. After we order, our bill was put on our table. We ate and left the correct money including the service charge onto the table. A waiter saw us as we left and nodded to my husband. However after we left the restaurant, we were chased after and were told we didn’t pay the bill! We told the woman we left it on the table, just like how they left the bill on the table. But she asked us to go back. Then as we approached our table, she loudly asked someone if the found the money! ( which was clearly on the table). Then someone else took the bill and without saying anything to us, just amended the bill and said this is the new bill with tea added. But there were no apologies for the mistake of missing the tea on the bill. ( and we were unaware to be fair) Worst of all is the woman made us felt like we left without paying!! Such an awful experience. If she explained when she saw us, there would be no problem at all but instead she said we never paid!! Made us feel like we ate and left!! In the end the assistant manager came and apologised on her behave although she still raised her voice to us. The assistant manager told her, she should have checked the table before bothering us and she seemed very annoyed he told her that. Needless to say, despite the apology by the AM, we will never return again. ","April 27, 2019","9    Royal Park Hotel

MTR is always packed even on weekdays non-peak hours so be prepared to stand throughout the journey. Hotel free shuttle runs at wide intervals: 10am, 12noon, 3.30pm, 6.45pm, etc to Tsim Sha Tsui. Need to book in advance as it only has about 20-pax capacity. From TST, we couldn't board the free shuttle as it was always full. Even worse when some rude guests cut queue. No advance booking is available. Hotel staff are very helpful to even bring forks to our room when requested. However, we weren't informed that the room heater wasn't working so we had a very cold first night of sleep in the hotel. But we were given a portable heater upon request the next morning. There are a Mcdonalds and Delifrance outlet at Hilton Plaza which is nearby. Go to the 3rd level of the hotel, press the button to go through a security door and cross the bridge located on the left and you will see Hilton Plaza.

An email was sent just prior to my arrival which had the hotel information in both English and Chinese, which made it very easy to get a cab- about $20 USD from the cruse port. Everything went smoothly at reception and my 7th floor room with a king sized bed was ready on arrival at 1 PM. The hotel is located adjacent to the business and market districts which allowed for great shopping. There are also endless restaurants in all price ranges nearby. The room was a bit small by US standards, but comfortable for a single person. The bathroom was good sized with a large shower. It was cool during my stay so I never fiddled with the AC but the thermostat loos to allow for plenty of adjustment. The room has plenty of USB hubs in various locations, including on the night stands. There was a large TV but I never turned it on. The upstairs gym has a fantastic view of the city but it was too early in the season for the pool to be open.

543,"Hilton Garden Inn at Mongkok has become my ""go to"" hotel whenever I come to Hong Kong. It is convenient to many public transportation options. Easy walk to a decent size shopping center and many HK Tea Cafe for food and snack. What also makes this Mongkok facility stand out is the great Front Desk staff, especially the assistant manager - Isaiah and the Front Desk rep - Moore. They make my every stay pleasant and enjoyable. I only wish it is easier to contact the hotel front desk directly. The HK phone number listed in the hotel directory indeed connects you to a Shanghai office where no service representative have any clue of my reservation or my questions. What a shame that the Corporate Shanghai Office of this facility is also not friendly.","July 7, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

The hotel provided excellent benefits for Hilton members (from providing a late check-out to complimentary welcome drinks and snacks) which was beyond the standards required of a typical HGI. We also enjoyed the breakfast with good quality local food. Much thanks goes to the excellent staff of the hotel, we would like to appreciate Natalie who was very helpful during our check-in and check-out and also Candy from housekeeping for her sweet gestures.The location of the hotel is fairly good in Mongkok and about 7min walk from the MTR station. Getting to the airport was also easy and it took about 45min on the bus A21. The size of the hotel room was decent and comfortable for 2 adults. A minor issue was that the hotel faced a major road there was slight noise pollution. We enjoyed our stay and will be back again!","June 24, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

557,"I stay at this hotel all the time when I travel through Hong Kong. I know my way around in Mong Kok area and I really appreciate when staff recognize that I am a return guest. However, during my past visit in early this month, the service went down from what i experienced. When checked in, I had to remind them my Diamond Status and claimed my own welcome drink coupon as it was not recognized/ offered upon check in. The room I had this time was on 19 floor, nice view but it has a very thin wall. My terrible next room neighbors were up talking and partying all night so i could not sleep at all. I called down at 1 am. and again at 2 am. but no one could help about the noise. I ended up checking out before 4 am so i could take a snooze at the lounge at the airport. Staff at check out was very condescending about my situation but she played dump like she didnt understand my complaints. Not sure if i wanted to stay here again.

561,"We stayed here for five nights and in the end were glad we did. There are lots of hotels to choose from in this city and we debated where to stay. It's not in the thick of things (i.e. HK island), and in some ways seemed a bit out of the way. But based on the things we wanted to do and see, ranging from Disney to the Peak, this hotel seemed like a good, middle location. Plus it was a brand we were familiar with -- so we booked it. And we were glad we did. The staff were great, the breakfast was pretty good, the view from the pool was nice. The front lobby is nicely done up and the self-playing piano is a cute touch. The room (1713) was very humid so we asked if there was anything they could do and they brought us a de-humidifier to use in the room, which helped a lot. The room was a bit snug for the length of stay and the luggage we had, but we figured it out. All the rooms face Cherry St Park.The interesting thing about the location of this hotel is that it's a shiny, new-ish hotel in an area that is not. The buildings around it feel old and run down, and the little businesses along the sidewalks are all trades -- like an outdoor Home Depot. But it's completely safe and no one really pays you any mind as you walk by, so the ""contrast"" starts to feel normal. Ultimately, you're experiencing real life Hong Kong -- sounds, smells, and sights -- and then escaping the heat and busyness in the comfort of a Hilton hotel.The hotel is a few blocks away from both the Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei MTR stations, which means you have easy access to everything in the area. We found it easy to learn to use -- you just need to know your end destination because that's how you buy the fare. (We didn't buy the Octopus card for this trip.) The Ladies Market is close by as well as Sneaker Street, and lots of other shopping areas. Mong Kok station is right beside the fancy, skyscraper Langham Place Shopping mall with its brand name stores and massively long escalators. There's also a variety of restaurants (western and Chinese) and coffee shops inside (including Starbucks), plus a couple of grocery stores in the basement. A Jollibee restaurant is outside the mall, along with oodles of Chinese restaurants. We also hailed a couple of Uber rides from here since the cabs in HK require cash and we didn't always have enough on us. But the hotel is happy to help you with this if you need it. Overall, for our trip this time it was a good location. Mong Kok is a vibrant, busy part of Hong Kong so this location gives you that experience and also puts you in a good spot to explore other attractions around town.","June 9, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

Location is next to Holiday Inn Mongkok and a mere 4-min walk from MTR Mongkok station (took Langham Place exit)As for the room, I got a corner room this time which is spacious and greatly appreciated. The bed is super comfy and overlooking cherry park (all room have this view and on the upper floors have harbour view). Bathroom comes with shower, sink, and toilet with Crabtree & Evelyn amenities. This time since I visited in May, the swimming pool was open and it has a stunning view over the harbour, despite smaller size, still enough to get few laps.

566,"Kudos to the management of this hotel! You can really tell when the staff is happy and well trained. So many good things to say about this stay - from the alert email I received before arrival - which had specific instructions on how to arrive including by metro, which exit to take coming out of the station and where to walk to reach the hotel. After 3 weeks traveling I was wondering when the hotels would figure this one out! When I arrived I asked for information regarding my departure as I wanted to prepare myself even though it was a couple days away. Out came a complete binder with photocopies already made and ready to pass out on airport options, dinner options for western style and Chinese food, shopping, maps etc. These guys definitely know the hospitality business. The hotel itself is in kind of a strange location especially if you are walking - but don't let that stop you from booking here. The rooms are small - typical for HK - but the linens are wonderful and the hotel has all the amenities you need. A special call out for Moore - the friendly front desk clerk who went out of his way to say hello each time I saw him at the desk.

Service oriented front desk staff, helpful all the way around for taxis, places to go, how to get there, etc. Breakfast is very good for the level of hotel property and the wait staff are well trained. The rooms are small (220 sq.ft.) and the street noise to be expected much like a hotel in downtown Manhattan. Easy access to nearby transportation - subway, MTR and even the coach bus to Zhuhai-Macau are all conveniently located within 5-10 minutes walking distance. The neighborhood is lined with many good eateries even well into the evening. Shopping mall, convenience store and drug mart and also nearby.For some unknown reason - I don't think it's b/c the walls are paper thin - perhaps the ducting - you can at times hear your next door neighbor talking like s/he's sitting right next to you. The voices transmit clearly but don't go on for very long.

577,"This was our first visit to Hong Kong. We were not familiar with the areas in which to book a hotel room so we went with the Hilton brand. Most of my review will be positive. The hotel itself is very clean. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. The lobby area and hallways were clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. HUGE kudos to MOORE who was so helpful to us when we arrived. We arrived early and although check-in wasn't until 3pm, he asked housekeeping to prepare our room and it was ready by 11am! There is a restaurant on site that offers a breakfast buffet or ala carte (both for a fee) We had the breakfast buffet each morning and there was a wide variety of offerings including an omelette bar and waffles. We did not use the restaurant for dinner. There is a mini-bar and it is stocked with 4 free cans of pop/beer (after that, there is a charge for the replacements)The pool was not opening until May 1st so we were not able to experience the pool area.There is a shopping mall within walking distance and a large, night vegetable/fruit market that is fun to see. The negative? Although the area is and feels very safe, it is in a more dodgy area. It is not within walking distance of the Woman's Night Market, the Fashion Walk or the Waterfront Promenade. We did the Hop on/off bus and were able to see many of the areas and get off at the stops that we wanted to tour. There is free Wi-Fi and a PC that is free to use in the lobby.","May 8, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

We booked a standard king bed room, it came with a very long sofa that spans the entire width of the room. This is god-send for our two and six year old children. They can sleep on either end of the sofa without disturbing each other. The hotel staff are very polite and make us feel welcome, which cannot be said for many other hotels we stayed in Hong Kong. When we checked in, the staff at the front desk also gave us a very brief yet comprehensive introduction to the nearby area, with many interesting suggestions of things to do. There were complimentary coke, sprite, beer and tonic water in the fridge, as well as bottled water. We had a fantastic stay.","May 1, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

587,"I am sitting in HGIM’s 2nd floor breakfast buffet room looking out its floor-to-ceiling window walls onto another bright building-humid day that will with absolute certainty explode into rain later this afternoon. Pea-soup-thick humidity does this. This is my 9th or 10th stay at this new-ish Mongkok mainstay and so I guess that makes me both a regular and loyal. Why?Location, room/bed/value/quality, rooftop pool, breakfast, laundry, and customer service execution. Let me take on the obvious to get to the meat. Obvious: Location is Mongkok - the heart of real day-to-day survival HK...a crowded checkerboard of commercial streets that offer anything and everything. Some lux on Nathan and Langham Place but by far mostly catering to residents for whom money is a far cry from “disposable income”. Mongkok beats to the tune of earnest hard-working people who know that riches lay elsewhere but getting to next week is very much here. Legacy b2b commercial shops that slice niche paper thin...need a custom iron chain - it gets machined somewhere here by a guy who knows chains like I know espresso, which is a very humbling realization. BTW, an easy 4-block walk to MTR and access to all that HK offers.Room/bed/value/quality is great by HK standards. Owing to its just-off-center-Mongkok location it can command only so much, yet its fantastically affordable room rate provides a very ergonomic room with a Hilton bed and pillow menu, an enclosed shower (no half-glass wet-floor bs here), thick curtains, good WiFi, and breakfast (below).Rooftop pool - Wha?! For this room rate I can take the elevator to the rooftop and swim in cool waters overlooking HK?! Insane.Breakfast seems your basic melding of east and west but surprises lay in store. Yes, custom egg and waffle station if you are desperate to avoid local eating culture, but for the more curious can start their day with congee and dim sum offerings. And need a little pop in your step beyond caffeine, add chili oil to everything and your eyesight will let you see through walls. Breakfast is included in my rate so life is good.Laundry is of the coin-operated variety on the 5th floor. This seems a minor matter but oh-my-god-no-it-is-not. For those of us who travel light to enable speed and flexibility, the in-house availability enables a 2-day wardrobe to last into infinity. Sure, you can use the typical hotel laundry service here as elsewhere, but then you are repurchasing your wardrobe each time, and you can’t do it on the day of arrival or departure. This is my idea of a travel luxe amenity. Meat:Customer Service at HGIM is not - I repeat NOT - of the standard Hilton HGI variety. Quite to the contrary, the HGIM provides the same standard of service that I enjoy at a 6-star property like 4S, Mandarin Oriental and their peers. The staff at HGIM executes at the highest possible level. Reception through all front-of-house staff are all smiles and hospitality, and accommodate my requests happily and without fail. I return time after time, unflinchingly, joyously because of the people skills here. I cannot day enough about this extraordinary aspect of HGIM.Having said all this, I have a teeny tiny irritant. The elevator and breakfast room music is a single song loop that reminds you each and every time that you are in the HGIM elevator or breakfast room. There’s a bit of water torture in this.But I ignore this minor irritant because on all other and more important counts this is a 10/10 hotel and hospitality experience.","April 28, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

Twin Room was an acceptable size for Hong Kong and was well-cleaned and nicely done up. Service was good, with a warm welcome and efficient check-out at reception (Joseph Ng - great service). Free breakfast for Hilton Gold - breakfast was good with bacon, spaghetti, salads, Chinese porridge, made-to-order omelettes and the usual breads. Location of the hotel was interesting - in a bit of an old-school HK neighbourhood, but aside from being a bit run down, was safe and quiet.

591,"Overall the hotel stay was quite good. It is within walking distance to the subway station nearby. The room was quite simple and small by Australian standards but I think okay for Hong Kong. I was not offered an upgrade on my room despite being Gold but not a huge deal. The elevators are extremely slow when going up or down, so be prepared for that. Food options in the hotel were limited. The lobby bar only sold finger food, and none of it was vegetarian friendly. The main restaurant was quite expensive and again lacked a lot of vegetarian dishes. Room service was good, speedy and the servings were a decent size. I tended to stick to the garden with a bowl of rice. My child had the fish and chips which was a large serving. Staff in the hotel were friendly and approachable. They were able to guide me which trains to catch to get where I had planned to go for the day. Overall I would recommend this hotel, however the price is fairly high given the room size. Shop around for a good price if possible. You may however find a better deal at a hotel more central to the tourist areas.","April 26, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

Also, Mongkok - the area - seems to have a bit of a reputation, but I honestly felt like it was the real HK which was really charming.As a gold member I was upgraded to a harbor view room, which was very nice. The rooms are quite small but thats to be expected in HK. I was especially impressed by the breakfast spread which you could tell was made with a lot of care and love. I must say this was likely the best breakfast I have had at a Hilton property so far. There is a gym thats also quite small but again this is HK. One just has to learn to deal with it I guess.

593,"Stayed for two nights on business, hotel booked by travel consultant. On arrival realized its in entirely the wrong location for meetings on the Island. Its touted as being a few minutes walk from Mong Kok MTR but in reality its a walk along dirty crowded streets in an area of light commercial shops - the sort of places that sell hardware, steel piping, electric fittings and the like, with dogs defecating and people expectorating in the streets where you have to walk and pull your luggage.Asked the hotel if I could cancel booking and go to Conrad, which is where I should have been; but of course, once Hilton have their claws into you with a first night, they would rather turn down the opportunity to get twice the price than show any flexibility.The hotel itself is depressing, situated next to a noisy multi-lane freeway and has zero lobby ambience.Avoid.","April 23, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

597,"I have been a Hilton Honors member since 2016 and the experience I had at Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong has left me disappointed to say the least. I felt that the apathy on part of the front office at the time of check-in - something I do not expect of a Hilton Hotel. I reached the hotel at 9:30am on a red eye flight. At the time of check-in I requested for an early check-in (a request had made before my travel too) which I understand is difficult to fulfill due to occupancy situations. My problem is the way I was treated and made to feel - 1) we will not update your HH number because you will not get any credits since the booking is made through a Travel Agent. I know I will not get any points but what is the harm in updating the membership number. After much debate, the executive agreed to take note of my HH number.2) you can sit anywhere here till we get the room ready - a lobby which was akin to a fish market at the time! Where can I freshen up - well, we do not have any place. You just have to wait here! And this does not make one feel any better because the toilet in the lobby is a unisex toilet!!!3) after an hour and a half I was hungry and tired and asked if I could have a cup of coffee. The breakfast closes at 10:30am and it is 10:25am now, we cannot give you coffee! When I insist, I am obliged with directions to the 2nd floor where I am not even allowed inside. The lady confirms that I am the same person who wants coffee and when I ask for a cappuccino with soya Milk, I am informed they do not have any Soya Milk. So I go back to the lobby and just sit there.4) I am finally given a room at noon - this is noteworthy and commendable because the check-in time is 3pm. I go upto my room which looks like it has just been trampled all over. The seating area wass dirty as was the ""ergonomic"" chair. I had to get the housekeeping staff to cover both with clean bedsheets so that I could use them.5) A big dampener is that the room service is only from 5pm to 9pm and as mentioned earlier, the restaurant / coffee shop works per stipulated timings.6) The area in which the hotel is located is not the most pleasant either. I did not want to venture out and for a vegetarian Indian like me, there weren't going to be many options anyways. 7) The in-room dining menu is limited with the vegetarian options only being the 2 types of salad and 1 soup (which I could not have because of my food allergy restrictions)8) Requested for french fries on one evening and after the order being placed was informed that they only had potato wedges!9) The day I checked-out which was after a week's stay, I struggled with my bags to head out to the porch to get into my cab while the staff just looked on and held the door for some young girls who were there to write an IELTS exam.The staff is well trained to say ""no"" to most requests and be apathetic towards the guests.I am disappointed and the stay has become memorable for all the wrong reasons!","April 17, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

Secondly the hotel is right next to a highway and has a piano playing in the foyer to hide the traffic noise. Rooms are described as ""Garden View"" and yet look over a busy highway and onto an Hong Kong housing estate. Road noise is audible from even the highest floors & may impact light sleepers. The north Harbour is over a mile away and cannot be seen from floors 1-18, obstructed views from floor 19 and distant views only from floor 20 or from the swimming pool or gym on the 22nd floor.

608,"This is five stars for the value at this price point. The Hilton Garden Inn Mongkok is a great value for those who know Hong Kong. It is deep in the Mongkok district, around the corner from Langham Place - but the location is neighborhoody. I mean that though the hotel is a tall, thin, contemporary glass edifice, itIs plunked down in the middle of a regular neighborhood. For me, this is good. I like the working class feel and the simple shops. This is not the place to bring someone who needs a pristine environment. It is not posh. For example, I would not bring suburban Americans or Canadians who had never been to Hong Kong to this location.The hotel is what you expect from Hilton’s Garden Inn brand. Very very friendly and adorable staff. The common areas are very nice - again an enormous contrast between the sparkling glass lobby and the usual grubby but fairly pleasant streets outside. The rooms are typical Hong Kong small, but very clean - comfortable beds and very good bathrooms. I must have a fridge and tea making apparatus- this is all good. The desk is small - and it was a bit worn - but the desk chair is very good, so I got lots of work done. The WIFI connection is excellent- much better than what I had at the Conrad recently. The view from the 19th floor is advertised as harbor view - it’s really just a whisper - just a sliver of harbor water that can be seen - and some nice mountains and hills. But, it’s bright and cheerful.Check out the MTR station locations - a few blocks to walk. (I walk and take taxis usually.)At current market rates of exchange, it’s possible to get a room for US$130 or £99, which is a most excellent price for Hong Kong.","April 3, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

610,"The hotel is clean and tidy. Apart for the size of the room and the occasional noise from the main road. Not good if you are a light sleeper though I was too sleepy to hear any. Mattress is quite comfy too.Short walking distance to Mongkok MTR via Langham plaza and ladies night market . Lot of eateries nearby The pool was closed during my stay so didn't check.Overall, pleasant stay and would recommend. ","April 1, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

My family stayed here for 4 nights and we enjoyed. Front desk clerks are friendly. They are willing to help. Price is reasonable. May be it was not the high season during our stay.

613,"Our stay this time is for five nights, arriving at the hotel just before normal check in. We stayed here last August and loved the staff and service, enjoyed the good quality breakfast and were very comfortable in the room provided.Our check in, meeting Frank and Natalie again was like meeting old friends, fast and efficient check in and getting a quiet room on the 20th floor.We had a fair amount of luggage being at the end of 10 weeks away from home, so the room did felt a bit tight in space. But this is typical of most hotels of this class in the region. It was very clean and received top class housekeeping service each day.The bed is comfortable and we slept well.We did asked for a room with a bigger bathroom on the 2nd morning and we moved to the end room on the next floor down, which does have more vanity space in the bigger bathroom.Breakfast food and variety is definitely the best amongst the hundreds of HGI of my previous stays. Flora always gives us a table near the window with fewer people squeezing pass. Restaurant service was also excellent.We also spent a bit of relaxation time at the ground floor bar each night and were well look after by Eric on each visit. Quite pleasant there, but perhaps the piano music could be turned down a little.As with our last stay, walking to the MTR station took 6 to 8 minutes, the pavement and street crossings are not great- but this is next to one of the busiest spots in HK, and this time, there were construction work going on nearby. But our ride around 8am back to the airport was just a easy 25 minutes. So will be back again, next time in HK.","March 31, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

614,"We are experienced travellers and as such wish to give an unbiased review that may help others in the choice of accommodation.We found The Hilton Garden Mongkok decidedly average. Nothing hugely wrong but there were a couple of issues: Noise ingress into the room (13th floor) from side to side and above was very noticeable. Even normal conversation (and worse) in neighbouring rooms could be heard, noise from guest traffic in the hallways also intruded. Exterior noise was noticeable too. Poor for a modern hotel.The reception/lobby/bar area is too small and there is a seemingly constant loud pianola playing .Staff were helpful and friendly but decidedly corporate.There is no shuttle-bus provision. We stayed for 4 nights as booked which was definitely enough. Wouldn't stay again even as HH members.","March 31, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

618,"Service was very good in all departments, especially at Reception which, in addition to its main job of check-in/out, has to deal with all requests i.e. for taxis and even to put calls to rooms, etc., etc.The buffet breakfast and its cooked to order eggs, etc is good, I particularly enjoyed making my own waffle with its various toppings. The food at the Chinese Restaurant is excellent, both at the lunch and dinner. The Bar next to Reception opens from 3 pm and the only place to get a bite of Western food. Would help if it could be opened earlier.On the down side, it is frustrating to call the hotel as it has no telephone operator - just an automatic machine and one has to wait a long time if Reception is busy. The location is not convenient - the 7-10 min walk to the MTR station is not pleasant and the MTR station is one of the busiest in Hong Kong - the area full of traffic with taxis difficult to get. A shuttle to Tsimshatsui should make our stay much more enjoyable.","March 29, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

619,"Disappointed. The Pros: Excellent reception staff. The fitness center was excellent, well equipped and maintained with good machines and a great harbor view while working out. That was the highlight of our two nights there. Cons: On our floor we found service cart and dirty laundry collecting bins left in the hallway often until very late both nights. As a result the narrow passageway was hazardous in an emergency. Rooms had thin walls, were on the small side for a King Deluxe, appearance rather drab and tired.We went to the bar area and the 1st night found it unattended. It was essentially tiny and unappealing as a lounge area and immediately adjacent to check-in area/waiting area. Went back the 2nd night to order a burger and beer and found the bartender there but a bit bewildered when we ordered food, even though there were ads in the elevator about ordering/having food at the bar.Then there was the restaurant... good reception, dinner menu with excellent Asian-centric foods and eclectic dishes. The service was average and removes slow. Wait staff was language challenged [very limited english] and a minor problem when ordering. Of greater concern was entree serving uncoordinated such that my entree served 15 minutes before my spouse. I complained [unusual for me] and got a smile and shrug. Breakfast buffet selection was very good but the same staff and organizational issues similar to the evening debacle. As I moved tongs to select from the fresh fruit offering it was suddenly whisked away for replenishment instead of bringing a newly refilled tray as replacement. Restroom next to the ersatz bar was poorly maintained and we observed street folk coming in to take advantage of it.Management issues abound here.","March 28, 2019","10    Hilton Garden Inn Hong Kong Mongkok

620,Hilton's branding in terms of hospitality and quality of stay came through. However the location is right between 2 MTR stations which require a minimum of 7 to 10min walk.

There were no boats leaving and no one in site. We were stranded there for some time until a taxi showed.

The AC also worked well. The breakfast was good (best of any Garden Inn I’ve stayed at - plenty of choice). The hotel’s location is only a short walk from the Ladie’s market and the MongKok MTR.

As a Diamond member got a room with a partial view of the Harbor. Nice small gym on the rooftop and what looked like a nice pool. Breakfast was a good variety of western and chinese. Service was brusk but efficient. The A21 bus drops you off about 5 minutes easy walk to the hotel- efficient service and very cheap from the airport. Would definitely stay here again if on my own.

It was in a safe area and easy to navigate to. The hotel itself was gorgeous; you can tell it’s fairly new. Our room was gorgeous and the huge rainfall shower was a big plus. The best part of our stay was how wonderful the staff was, especially Simon Lee, the director of operations. He was the first person we met upon check in and he was so welcoming and friendly. He got us checked in fast and I believe he even upgraded our room for free. He then asked about our travel plans and we mentioned how we planned to spend our 3 day short trip shopping and going to Hong Kong Disney. He provided us with great advice on where to go, how to get there, and how to bargain!! For Hong Kong Disney he gave us great advice to bring 2 big bottles of water and it was the best advice ever because we saved money and didn’t have to buy a drink once. Simon also gave us 2 pins that he said we could keep or use to trade at the park. We both decided to keep the pins he gave us as a souvenir of our fond memory of Simon and our amazing stay at the lodgewood.

Matthew and I were too tired, we just sit down and kept chatting. Suddenly, Matthew found that his iphone was lost so I wanted to find someone for help.When we felt frustrated, James who was a great staff, came and helped us to find Matthew’s iphone.

650,"The hotel is located in a light industrial area of Mongkok and could be slightly rowdy in the mornings. However, the hotel is pretty new and has easy access to eateries, cinema and shops. We were given a free upgrade to a bigger room as we had a kid and the smaller room cannot fit a baby cot. Moreover, we were given a late check out at 3pm as our flight was late in the evening. Thumbs up to Steven Lee and his team for the great hospitality and pleasant stay! We enjoyed our 2 nights (7-9 Mar19) at the hotel too as it was very convenient to Langham Place and Mongkok station.

But there isnt any convenience store nearby, need to walk 5 min to the main street to the convenience store.

653,"Don’t read all the nonesense pointing out all the negatives. I’ve stayed in the worlds best 5 star hotels for business and I could pull them to pieces too. This trip was for leisure and I wanted modern, clean, comfortable and well priced. Bingo! I got the lot. Add in a helpful front desk team and you could not ask for more. Close to Mong Kok station, near major malls, 10 min walk to Nathan Rd etc To the people who complained about the hard beds....you may not have liked it but my bad back loved it! Sure they are hard but for me it was comfortable on crisp white sheets and good pillows. If you’re looking for lots of space pick somewhere else....for me there was plenty of room.....king bed, good bathroom, hot strong shower.

656,"What a beautiful discovery!Back in Hong Kong for 2 nights, we decided to try a new hotel on Kowloon. We weren’t sure about Lodgewood. But it had a few elements that we did not encounter in other hotels in HK but there’s a Chinese restaurant, which we did not experience.Lodgewood is well located, in Mongkok, you can go walking to Nathan road. Landmark mall is just a 5mn walk away with plethora of restaurants and culinary experiences. There’s a fruit market just across the road. The hotel is eco-friendly which was a plus for us. There is no option for breakfast at the hotel.The hotel has a very modern feel with its interior design from entrance to rooms. Every detail has been looked after and that s very rare, this is a detail oriented person who’s talking!! There’s a nice mixture of natural elements like stone and wood material in the bathroom which we really loved. Rooms have a good stand of cleanliness.At the reception level, there’s a sitting area were you can sit and take tea or coffee and fruit while waiting. Other hotels should take a note. We were welcomed by Vivian who was very professional, nice and willing to help. We were given room #2003 which was very small. I had crutches and couldn’t move around without bumping into things. We told Vivian and she offered another room which was differently set so a little better for me but still a little difficult. Then as we went back to reception to get some information Vivian had searched for us, she said she had talked to the manager Mr. Lee and he offered us an upgrade to a bigger room for the second night. We were very surprised and a little embarrassed as we did not expect such an outcome. Thank you Vivian for being so genuinely concerned.The suite is just fabulous, well set and designed with beautiful furniture again every detail has been well thought. We had the corner suite # 2004. It is for 3 people, I would think 4 could stay in. Two toilets (very useful. With toilet tissue at the very right place. Thanks to the designer). The bathroom is bigger with, O what a surprise, a Jacuzzi.There s a microwave in all rooms for those interested. The beds in both room types are very comfortable. It feels just like home. We wish we had had more time to appreciate the suite. All staff from entrance to reception and management are very eager to help and so very welcoming.We met the famous Mr. Lee. We’ll make him even more famous now that we have met him. We had a very interesting existential conversation! Because he’s just as described in other posts. I had a double ankle strain and he helped me find a TCM doctor, which was very helpful, together with TCM shop ( Thank you, we went to Yue Hwa and found what we were looking for). He also came to our room to put a bandage on my ankle. It is very rare to find a manager, in a hotel of this size and standard, who is genuinely concerned by the wellbeing of the guests. Mr. Lee is and that reflects. Professionalism and genuine interest. Thank you all.We definitely recommend this hotel. We ll stay again at Lodgewood.","November 18, 2018","11    Lodgewood by L'hotel Mongkok Hong Kong

657,"We stayed there for 4 nights on the 17th floor. The location is excellent, only 5-6 minutes walk from exit A Mongkok station. Lots of local diners around for budget meals. Our room was an interconnected room 1702 in front of the lift. The walls are very thin and we could hear whole conversions from the guests next door, as well as people who use the lift.Free coffee on the lobby floor is useful.Staff were polite.Room was small but adequate. Our view was an unobstructed city view given the high floor. There's slippers, shower gel and shampoo. No body lotion or conditioner. The hairdryer was powerful. There's mugs, plates, bowels, cutleries, fridge and microwave which was very good.

We accidentally stained the bedsheet but we forgot to “inform” the staff to replace the bedsheet by putting the card on the bed. However, I thought seeing the stain on the bedsheet the staff should have changed the bedsheet without instructions from us since it was stained. Reception staff were friendly though.

660,"Great Stay with Great ValueAlthough I arrived way earlier than standard check-in time, I still could enter my room after a cup of complimentary coffee at lobby and few minutes of waiting. Hotel serves complimentary coffee, tea and fruits at lobby floor. It’s really a considerate service to all in-house guests who have early flight out of Hong Kong or early birds who need coffee to start a day.Hotel is just 5-10 minute walk from A2 exit of Mong Kok Station. There are a lot of convenience stores, fruit vendors, Cantonese & dim sum restaurants, money exchangers on the way from subway station to hotel. Hotel doesn’t provide breakfast, but it was not a problem to me, since there are a lot of choices close to the hotel.The room was nice and clean. Just like most of the hotels in Hong Kong, the guest rooms were smaller than the standard rooms you stay in the rest of the world. The mattress was slightly harder than standard, but it was really comfortable. Pillows were solid and supportive. Unfortunately, there was sewage smell as soon as I entered the room, which didn’t have the aromatic smell at lobby. Despite the sewage smell, the room was great with French window. Housekeeper also did an excellent job on making up the room.Hotel staffs were nice. It would be perfect if the receptionists have had smiles and warmer greetings.

Or they help you and guide you to your taxi after checking out. Very nice, thank you.My room was not big (the cheapest one), but very nice, quiet and so functional! You can find plenty of storage and very smart way to arrange everything. So you can feel at ease. The only thing is that it seems they don’t provide breakfast.

Asked for a slightly later checkout and they obliged. As mentioned, walkable dist from Prince Edward or Mongkok mrt. Personally prefer to A2 exit of Mongkok Mtr.

667,Stayed with L'hotel brand for the first time. Loved the city but often felt overpaid for outdated hotel with small rooms. This time is the total opposite as I felt I am getting a good value for a spacious and modern room! L'hotel Mongkok was a modern contemporary hotel with spacious rooms tucked away in the quiet side of Mongkok and yet within walking distance to the hustling and bustling shopping district/restaurants and mtr station. There's a playground park and local market steps away from the hotel. The Hot Pot restaurant is a must try!Mr. Simon Lee was very quick in responding to email and he's a very at his trade. Ms. Kasey Chan/Guest Service Manager assisted me during check in and she was very friendly and professional.Overall I am very impressed with my stay and L'hotel brand that can rival a more established international hotel chains.

It is near the Prince Edward and Mong Kok MTR stations and close to the Ladies Market and Sneaker Street. It is not a touristy area, but it does show you a different slice of what it is like to live in Hong Kong.I wouldn't have otherwise chosen the hotel for its location, but it worked out fine. The Lodgewood rooms were modern and nice and somewhat larger I think than the average Hong Kong hotel room. There was a microwave and plates and dinnerware for two people which I didn't expect. The beds were Asian firm with nice pillows.It almost seemed like a micro apartment more than a hotel room since reception is one floor up from the entrance.

Midnight wanton noodles? You can find them here. Also close to the fresh food markets so fresh fruit was always available nearby.The Wi-Fi is free and super fast!

Inside is no different; sleek, clean and meticulously designed, not at a far cry from its previewed pictures (unlike other hotels).

680,"This is a lovely, comfy hotel situated in a quiet yet convenient location. We first picked this hotel among others because of the rate they offered online. Soon we found out that it has a lot more to offer. We took bus no. A21 from airport and got off at the 5th stop, then walked about 5 mins to come to the hotel. The lobby is on 1st floor. Check in was very efficient and simple and soon we found ourselves in a room which is, though not very spacious as understandably this is HK, very clean, neat and comfortable. It's got almost everything a room is needed (even slippers too) and the bathroom is spacious with toiletries included.After settling ourselves down, we went down to the lobby again and found that there were teas, coffees and fruits that were free for the hotel guests all day round. There were usb charging ports on each coffee table which's convenient when we were there enjoying our time & coffee.Though situated in a quiet street (which we prefer), it is within 5 mins walking distance to the nearest 'Mongkok' subway station, and the same to the nearest Langham Place shopping mall where a variety of cuisines are available. In addition, there is a good Chinese restaurant just round the corner for morning 'yumcha' and 2 supermarkets within 3 mins of walking.We stayed on 2 occasions in this trip, as we took a week off to Australia in between our stay there. The hotel staff have been very polite and helpful throughout our stay. They helped us with any questions we had, and let us store our big luggages during our getaway to Oz. There were 3 staff which caught our particular attention and gratefulness for their service, working attitude and willingness to help: Simon, Jessica and Tiffany. Towards the middle of our stay, they were not only hotel staff but we felt that they were like part of our family. One thing which we are particularly grateful for: Simon, who we found out on the date of our departure is the Operations Manager of the hotel, offered to help us with our luggages (total 6 pieces for the 2 of us is a little too many) to walk to the A21 bus stop together. What a gentleman he is and we wish him all the very best in his future endeavour!We certainly will stay here again!","March 17, 2018","11    Lodgewood by L'hotel Mongkok Hong Kong

681,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 days in March 2018.Let's start from good points:1) Location (close to MTR Mong Kok and East Mong Kok, just few stations away from Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade)2) Room size ( quite big for Hong Kong)3) Wi-Fi (fast connection)4) Restaurant (serves amazing Hot pot - MUST to try!)5) Free fruits, coffee and tea in a lobbyBut all this doesn't really matter when there's NO SERVICE in a hotel. I'm particularly talking about reception staff (restaurant team was good) who careless. They were paying attention to Chinese guests only, nothing to European ones! I felt bad, honestly,,,Upon c/I lady couldn't explain well anything about facilities in English and tried to get from us 1000$ HKD as deposit which I rejected to give.No greetings from staff during entire stay... And upon c/o no one asked how was our stay... This isn't hospitality!!! Won't be recommending to anyone stay in this property.","March 13, 2018","11    Lodgewood by L'hotel Mongkok Hong Kong

685,"We booked 5 nights in this hotels as the reviews were good and Crowne Plaza never disappointed, We are happy we picked Crowne Plaze Kowloon East. We checked in and were shown to our rooms. The room came with all the amenities. Everything was neat and tidy and the room was welcoming. On the 2nd night we noticed a leak in the toilet. We let the reception know about this and a lady came up to check it. She said maintenance needs to fix it and they would move us.Since it was past 11 pm. we asked if a temporary fix was possible and do the rest next morning as we needed to leave early. It was not a problem. Next evening when we came back, there was a letter saying that they needed to change our room. I called and was arranged. we were moved to a higher floor. Only then I noticed a second letter stating all was fixed. Anyway they moved us. It's a running business and of course things will go wrong occasionally. But the way they took care of it was perfect,Breakfast was included and we enjoyed it every day. you have all sorts of cuisine to choose from. Fresh juices, salads noodles eggs, breads rolls cakes etc. etc. We really liked the European cheese and smoked salmon. The hotel is next to or part of a mall Popcorn Mall and there is a MTR station in it. This is very convenient. And being next to the mall (2 malls actually. Connected), meals were never a problem.Pool is situated on the 5th floor. my daughter (7 years) went swimming. It was hot so I stayed inside the door. There were 3 people watching the water. They checked with me if she can swim. She can. I was impressed how they were watching to keep everyone safe just in case.We had a wonderful 5 nights stay and if and when we return to Hong Kong, we will certainly consider this hotel.Thank you for a wonderful first impression of Hong Kong.

691,"Crowne Plaza is a brand I trust and this one is no exception. The hotel not only upgraded me but gave me free breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour. Plus they gave me 50 percent off for dinner buffet. Basically I didn't have to go out to eat if I didn't want to. The Mall is located right at the Popcorn Mall/Tsueng Kwan O MTR so is easily reached by MTR, about 40 minutes from HK Station. And they have buses that go to hotel from airport and vice versa. Another thingnice about the location is that it is one bus ride to Sai Gun, where great fresh seasfood can be had. And the staff was great, from the door people, receptionists and especially those ladies at the happy hours. Another big plus are the pool and sauna. The pool is long, not too crowded and there were 2 days I was there with 2 other people. The showerroom and sauna were beautiful. The only complain I have is a staff at breakfast was not that friendly and that's a bummer because she was the first person I saw that day. Other than that, this is a great hotel and I highly recommend it. ","June 14, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

Special thanks to the crew that helped me getting in shape before my fly back home.

697,"One generally doesn't think of Crowne Plaza as an upscale hotel, but more like a glamorized Holiday Inn, but this hotel breaks that mold. Located in a more residential area of Hong Kong, East Kowloon, it is admittedly not the place to stay if you want the aura of downtown Hong Kong / Kowloon – you need to use a cab or metro to get to those touristy and business areas. However, if as in my case, I needed to be near the Hong Kong Design Institute (where I had meetings), the location is excellent. It is also adjacent to indoor / covered shopping malls. And the rooms are fairly reasonably priced, especially by Hong Kong standards.This hotel had large, comfortable, clean rooms with excellent furnishings. (I have had experience in other much more expensive Hong Kong hotels with minuscule rooms!) The bathrooms had both tubs and showers (most business travelers have absolutely no use for a bathtub and a stall shower is really appreciated). The bedding was quite comfortable.Internet (wired and wireless) is available at no extra cost and provided a very good and reliable 20 mbits/second down and up bandwidth.All staff that I encountered were exceptionally friendly and helpful.The breakfast buffet (included with some room rates) was excellent with a wide variety of fresh offerings including both Western and Asian.The hotel has three restaurants. The restaurant on floor 1 is primarily for buffet all day with a la carte offerings available for lunch and dinner. Although least expensive of the three restaurants, I actually preferred its food over the other restaurants in the property.The restaurant on the second floor is strictly Chinese cuisine. The restaurant on the 47th floor (which also has an outdoor terrace bar) styles itself as a cross between a steakhouse and Italian restaurant. For better or worse, I was not at all impressed with the restaurant on the 47th floor; my experience was that the food at the much less expensive first floor venue was actually much better. All three restaurants seem to attract not only hotel guests, but local families with children and all three be very noisy. If that bothers you, look elsewhere for dining.All in all, I would recommend this property and wouldn't hesitate to come back if I had a need for lodging in this general area of Hong Kong.","June 5, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

698,"Admittedly I have not stayed anywhere else in HK, but this means they must be doing something right. It is perhaps 10 minutes more from the airport, but for the price I find it worth it. I stay primarily in Crowne Plaza and Intercontinental in mainland China and this was is very comparable if not a touch better, particularly with the staff. There is a mall for grabbing a bit next door, as well as, metro and cabs readily available, so location really isn't an issue. I love the outdoor pool for laps and the bar on the 47th floor is really fantastic. Ginny at the front desk was particularly helpful during my last stay, I am sure I will be back.","May 28, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

703,"For a supposed upmarket hotel, the breakfast area was more like a basic cafeteria. The coffee was rubbish and the food very disappointing. We had booked a club room and were supposed to enjoy a 'happy period' with free drinks and food. We made the mistake of including a friend who had worked with us during the day and we thought we would catch up during the evening. The hotel staff could not handle this at all and despite my repeated assurances that I would pay for anything that she ate or drank, they kept reminding us that she was not included in the room rate. When I complained the following day, the response from the hotel was condescending saying that they looked forward to my next visit.

My family and I had planned a trip to Hongkong to celebrate my parents 40th wedding anniversary and our 10th wedding anniversary. However due to the closing of operations of Jet Airways in India my parents and my sisters booking was cancelled and they could not fly. I reached out to The Front Service Manager Edgar Chee and Matthew Wong were quick to realise the situation and promised to refund the booking without charge which my family had booked for 7 days. My wife and I went to Hongkong for 3 days and the service was superb. We arrived early at around 10 am and Matthew organised a early check in for us. They also went through the trouble of sending us a couple of goodies as a gesture for our 10th wedding anniversary.The buffet breakfast was a good spread.I will definitely visit Crowne Plaza again and I do acknowledge the service provided by Matthew and Edgar.,"May 5, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

717,"Booked the hotel without really doing any research and as a first time visitor not knowing about the geography of Hong Kong.On reading different TA reviews almost cancelled due to the adverse comments about location, but am glad I didn't.Whilst the hotel certainly isnt in the hub of the tourist areas, it is very clean, comfortable and quiet, close to loads of resteraunts and right by the subway which even for a novice is incredibly easy and cheap to navigate.Breakfast was fantastic with a wide selection of both Western and local dishes and service throughout top notch - we were able to check in early which was a much appreciated bonus.You wouldnt expect bar prices to be cheap in this kind of hotel, but became acceptable by taking advantage of the various offers.Didnt use the hotel resteraunts - they did look expensive (with so many other options around), but we were told by another guest that it was possible to significantly reduce the proce by getting a voucher from reception - not surprisingly the hotel did not advertise this!One slight downer, we travelled in March which meant the Hotel pool was closed (no problem it was mentioned on the website so we knew in advance), but this ocmbined with weddings taking place meant that there was no out door space (that we found) where we could sit and relax in the warm spring sunshine,All ni all happy t recemmend the Hotel","April 16, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

Two negative points: Location and elevator. The location of this hotel is a bit far from the airport and the city center. / As the elevators have to cover many floors, therefore, sometimes we have to wait for it for a long time.

When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that our reservation had not been paid and that we would need to pay for the total amount before checking in. Turns out, there was a miscommunication on 3rd party authorization between the hotel and our company. It took a while to resolve. On the other hand, the hotel's location was excellent as it had easy access to Popcorn mall and Tseung Kwan O station. Breakfast buffet was excellent. The room was also very clean.

737,"We have visited this hotel many times since its inception a few years back. We chose this location because it is probably the best in the neighbourhood. Over the years, hardware needs to be refreshed, e. g. mable counter top's protective coat is completely ruined. It needs to be scraped off and re-coat. Today as it stands, one can see the dirt embedded in the scratch mark as well as feel the scratches. Flushing of toilets are noisy, one can hear your neighbours.TV is dated.Drapery feel unclean when touched. May be it is the material, or it may be simply cumulative dust.Elevator service seem slower than previous times, recommend split level controls to be implemented and perhaps incorporate one of the three service elevators for the exclusive of the upper 15% floors. Service wise, housekeeping seems to be above average, but overall in both the first floor (european buffet), and second floor (chinese) restaurants, wait staff lack enthusiasm.In the European restaurant, you can find often times, three up to five servers congregate at the coffee machine stand and chit chat, while waiting to get coffee for customers. The entire seating area covers easily 400SM, with perhaps 200 plus seats, but with only one coffee preparation station. Servers will walk by your table, with nothing in their hands and not pick up any used plates.I have witnessed a young mother fixing her todler's hair for over 15 mins in the restaurant with no regards to other customers. I certainly do not want any dust or hair into my buffet. Noodle chef and the reception / cashier are both efficient and friendly exception.While in the Chinese restaurant, there were no smile coming out from any of their wait staff. They do refill hot water diligently.Front Desk was not performing its duty as promised. We had an early (7:15) flight arrival which the Hotel reservation is well aware off. We understand that it would be based on availability for early check in, thus we purposely went to the Hotel after a full breakfast elsewhere till 10:30. Of course, there were no rooms available, but the Front Desk staff informed us that there should be availability by noon, and even promised to call or messaged if there is an earlier room. Obviously, there was no call or message, and we returned after 13:20. There were no upgrade of room, even though suposedly when one reaches a higher level of IHG this will be one of many benefits. For a party of three, we have only set of two amenities in our room as well as two complementary drinks tickets at the Lobby Lounge. The Hotel was informed during reservation, that we are travelling with a young teen.Only reason why I try to provide details of this experience is that I do not have much other choices if I wish to stay in the same neighbourhood. I do want the Hotel to improve for my enjoyment. ","March 21, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

738,"Staff very friendly and helpful, and the room quality was excellent. A good bed, desk and bathroom. Even a fridge with some free drinks.Not much of a view because you are surrounded by a forest of equally high residential towers, but this makes for a spectacular curtain of lights at night.The Cielo restaurant on the top floor has a good view and some reasonable value food options.The breakfast had a very good range of nice food. Like everything in Hong Kong the tables are quite close together so don't expect private conversation.The hotel is directly connected through the Tseung Kwan O MTR station, simply by walking a few yards through the ""Popcorn"" mall (well signposted). The hotel is fairly well connected on the MTR system for getting around Hong Kong.The downside is getting here from Hong Kong Airport. One option is the E22A bus taking about 100 minutes for HKD24. You need exact change so buy a bottle of water in airport to break your new notes. This bus makes a tour of the airport freight forwarding facilities then gives an authentic look at non-tourist Hong Kong so has some interest!The other option is the Airport Express train. Go all the way to Hong Kong station then a longish passageway to Central station and take the MTR to North Point (direction Chai Wan) then change to line for Tseung Kwan O (direction Po Lam or LOHAS Park). Ignore the MTR website recommendation of a more complex route. It seems that the Airport Express and MTR tickets need to be bought separately. Note that you can check in and drop luggage at Hong Kong station before boarding Airport Express when leaving.","March 18, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

749,"We stayed at the hotel for 6 days, using it as a base for seeing the city. While the hotel itself was excellent and the MRT incredibly cheap and very easy to use, we found that the travel from East Kowloon tiring with a minimum of three trains needed each way to visit the main tourist attractions in the city. The staff at the hotel went out of their way to make our stay pleasant and we were impressed that the senior staff were especially welcoming. With an excellent shopping Mall on its doorstep, its facilities and pricing make it ideal for a restful holiday, rather than as a tourist base. With the construction of new connections already underway linking East Kowloon with Hong Kong Island, access to the city will be improved but this will not be completed for several years.

756,"We chose to hold our wedding party at Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East as we believe that it is an international famous hotel and is well-known by providing high quality service to its customers. However, we are so disappointed that we have a very bad experience on 15 December 2018 in the hotel.We checked in suite room on 14 December 2018. On the next day at 3 p.m., we received a call from your Hotel front desk Assistant Manager, Mr. Matthew Wong that we would have to pay an extra HK$5,000 as a penalty due to some damages found on room’s desk.We would like to express our complaints to Mr. Matthew Wong as below:1) Unacceptable attitude throughout the whole process;2) We have explained to Matthew Wong that the damage is not created by us, but he refused to listen or investigate further. Instead, he chose to solely rely on internal record;3) Inconsiderately making frequent calls to us during the day that seriously influence our marriage ceremony;4) Refused to provide any official documents for the settlement of extra charges;5) Refused to provide any assistance from him and from any other hotel colleagues and insisted that we must settled the extra payment before leaving the hotel. Not to mention his frivolous attitude of asking us to complain to Consumer CouncilWe had spent over HK$400k in hotel and we believe that we are not supposed to receive all these unfair and impolite treatments especially on this special day. Due to this matter and extremely bad service, we felt very depressed which is is seriously affecting our sleep and emotion till now, i and my husband will remember this matter forever.We would like to have follow up and revert us the appropriate responses, providing us all necessary investigation results including the reimbursement of the unreasonable charge of HK$5,000.","January 14, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

757,"Stayed there for 9 nights over the year end-new year period. This place offers a decent enough stay, considering how far away it seems to be from the city area, major tourist attractions and the airport. However as it is sitting right on top of the Tseung Kwan O station and a big shopping mall, we found it accessible enough. Rooms were nice and pleasant, staff were friendly and helpful. All considered, quite a nice stay. One major inconvenient though was the glass partition between the room and the bathroom, which does not offer much privacy even with the blinds pulled down fully because the blinds are still translucent in certain light conditions.","January 4, 2019","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

760,"We are coming to the end of 7 days stay at Crowne Plaza. While it is a long way out of the main tourist areas it is right on top of an MTR which in HK is worth any location. Being able to walk out the front door, about 50 yards and down to the train is a bonus as is the Popcorn Shopping Centre that the hotel is connected to. The room we had was quite spacious for 3 single beds. Housekeeping did a wonderful job of keeping us tidy and replenished with water and bathroom essentials. The 3rd bed was as hard as a concrete slab but the linen fresh and comfy. The Cielo cafe on the rooftop had great Italian food and the service was friendly and fast. Cocktails on the deck with a nice surround view was a welcome retreat after a day of shopping. The cafe on the foyer was a little disappointing as the service was slow.

761,"Stayed in CP 2 nights at end of a cruise. Hotel is beautiful, and room was very spacious -- more than I expected in a crowded place like HK where real estate is so expensive-- and well decorated.. Service was excellent, and staff were very helpful. Wifi worked great, even for streaming Netflix on my computer. Location was convenient, with a metro station in the Popcorn mall next door. Bed was very comfortable. Our only complaint was that the bed has a duvet, instead of a sheet and bed spread. I realize that much of the world prefers a duvet, but it's always a mystery to me why that should be the case, and this trip was an example of the problem. We had a hard time keeping the temperature low enough in the room to make it comfortable to sleep under the heavy duvet, and so we ended up having to sleep either with no cover at all, or else we would wake up sweating. That would not happen with a sheet. If we had been staying longer, I would have requested a sheet and comforter, but it wasn't worth it for 2 nights, and I'm not sure they would have accommodated that request. In any case, all things considered, I would recommend this place, and would come back here again. But I still wish they'd get rid of the damned duvet!","December 23, 2018","12    Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East

769,"I stayed in that Hotel from 25/11 to 28/11 (after a relatively longer tired overseas trip ) for the purpose of visiting my senior elder age family members in Hong Kong . Upon check in, I were surprisingly informed that I could no longer be able to make use of the usual self laundering service in their sister hotel Holiday Inn Express next door of which it had not been advised to me earlier, upon my booking and or prior to my arrival. However, I met a very helpful front office staff Ms Jessica Ng and her supervisor Mr Matthew Wong who had tried their very best efforts to get exceptional approval for me to access this laundry service. This usual laundering service is very beneficial to / convenient for me as I had used it when I stayed in either one of their hotels ( I had been their customers whenever I visited Hong Kong in the past few years ). More than that, Ms Jessica Ng had done an extra value added services to find and provide information of external self laundering service firm nearby just in case they could not get approval from Holiday Inn Express. This value added and proactive attitude are deeply well appreciated. I was also impressed by his Senior colleague Matthew Wong who had also tried very hard to convey my request to their sister hotel.I respect the decision and policy of each hotel but I believe customers’ need will be considered and taken care of in particularly no prior notices of changes have been sent to the customers earlier. Keep on your good work.....Jessica and Matthew.

790,This is a small friendly clean modern hotel with plenty of local facilities. The rooms are cleaned every day. We stayed here as we had relatives in the area. I am so glad I chose this hotel. I am not sure why people are giving such low reviews. I’ve stayed in 5 star luxury hotels. I work in travel. For a 3 star it is what it is.,"February 23, 2019","13    iclub Ma Tau Wai Hotel

791,"This low priced hotel is a great choice for both westerners and mainlanders. Clearly there are busloads of tour buses pushing through this hotel every day and creates an environment that may feel harsh to westerners but in reality requires you to step back and observe rather than criticize.If your interest is a low priced, clean and convenient offering, please consider. We stayed on a higher floor with lovely views of the street scenes, rooftops and hillside. Great photographic opportunities of rooftop clothesline’s and “life” in HK.While we were afraid we might be isolated in this corner of Kowloon, after arrival we realized that the bus connections are incredible and get you into the city in less than 15 minutes. The bus stop is only two blocks from the hotel. Make sure you use Google maps or equivalent to navigate you to the stops. We intentionally brought the smallest amount of clothes and planned to launder. There are many, many laundry facilities within a two minute walk (and also in the hotel) that offer either self wash, drop and pickup or automated lockers. We chose the later two and quickly understood how to navigate this modern automated approach. The automated lockers were our favorite as they are autonomous, 24 hours and same day completion. Beware though as it requires that you have a HK phone chip in your phone because they text you a code needed to pickup. Machines all have EnglishI read all the negative reviews about the hotel staff and while we experienced some of the bad comments, having lived in HK for 9 years we certainly were able to understand the cultural differences causing these comments.Keep in mind that you are getting a small, clean and modern room at a low price because this business is simply a “machine of convenience” that pumps travelers through on a daily cycle. If you want a fancy four start hotel then go to one!Whatever we asked from hotel staff they gave us.....iron and board, changing of bedding when we thought dirty, extra soap/toilet paper/water/etcWhen we arrived in the room the bed seemed to be positioned facing the shower wall instead of the TV. We simply turned it around and all was good.Enjoy","February 8, 2019","13    iclub Ma Tau Wai Hotel

792,"Can't remember how many times we have been staying at this hotel, we got our membership upgraded to Platinum.Part of the reasons we chose this hotel was because of its price and its 24-hr i-lounge services. You can grab a nice cup of hot water or tea whenever you need.I remember I had sent an email to the head office of the hotel commenting on some issues we've found the very first and second time we visited this hotel. Many of them actually had already got resolved and we saw improvements there when we visited again maybe half a year later. That means you guys really would care about the comments your customers provided. That is good!The rooms were cleaner and more tidy. Even for the attitude of those front-end staff, to be fair, not everyone of them were rude. Some were quite friendly, but too bad it might be just one or two staff members' manner or personality that ruined the overall score! This is yet to be improved. You should understand that the front-line staff is a status symbol of a hotel. Maybe they were working in pressure all the time and you could tell from their faces that they were not very happy.Talking a bit more about this visit, firstly we were given a very high floor room which was good (at least for the first few nights). One night when our next room was occupied, not sure how many people were there but we heard lots of people talking & yelling loudly at the corridor and from the room, it was almost midnight. They just treated the hotel like their home....Sigh! There was a door in between the 2 rooms and we could hear that they had tried many times to open that door. That was really disgusting! We could smell some cigarette and the next day when we left our room, we even saw a piece of cigarette butt in front of the elevator door! We reported the case to the front-desk staff. But, what can you expect. That front-desk lady just said she would send someone to take a look.... Another suggestion to you is : I hope when your front-desk staff gives the hotel card to the customers, please remind them to tab the card before pressing the floor number when using the elevator. We have seen many customers just did not know about that and we had to show them how to get into their floors many times. They were quite miserable and this can be eliminated.

795,"I went to Hong Kong in late October and stayed at this hotel for three nights. The hotel is very clean and only a little over a year old. The rooms are small but have everything you need. The breakfast isn't the typical American fare with bread, bananas, apples being the main stays, but it worked. There didn't seem to be very few (if any) public water fountains so take advantage of the free bottled water the hotel provides every chance you get. Other than some communication problems (which seemed universal in Hong Kong; mostly related to directions) the only potential downside to this hotel is that it isn't near Hong Kong island, the airport or the tourist attractions. They do offer a free shuttle, which we had to call to get them to come and get us at the airport upon arrival and sign up for a time to go back to the airport, but getting back to the airport at a specific time to go back o the hotel seemed like a big effort. So instead we were able to take the bus which picks up and drops you off on the street directly south (behind) the hotel and then it is a quick walk thru the lighted alley to the hotel. You can also take the subway which has two stations that are about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. The buses run something like every 6-9 minutes so that was and easy option from the Victoria Harbor area, but I recommend getting an Octopus card because the buses don't make change. Note you have to have Hong Kong dollars to get money loaded on the Octopus card because you can't use a credit card to load money onto the cards (weird ,but maybe because of fraud (?)). Anyway, the hotel is in a neighborhood so I think you get more of a taste of the local culture staying here or somewhere like it and we felt very safe. I recommend it.","December 17, 2018","13    iclub Ma Tau Wai Hotel

799,"Booked this hotel through British Airways and had a very good deal. There were four of us so we had a taxi from the airport as we were advised that it would be as cheap as using the Airport Express and would also be easier - cost of the taxi was 320 Hong Kong dollars and it is easy to do as there are people who sort them for you and tell the drivers where you want to go in Chinese. Check-in was very efficient. We were a bit shocked to see how small the rooms were as we kept having to ask each other to move so that we could pass! The room was set up as a double and think it is really meant to be a twin room as, when the two single beds are put together, the person on the inside has to climb over if they need to get up through the night due to the bed being pushed up against the window and there being a table at the end of the bed which blocks access. Also the light switches are at the back of the bed and it is easy to knock them on and off by mistake when the bed is set up as a double - they would be between the two beds otherwise. The bed is also quite short - my husband is 6'2"" and his feet were touching the table at the end of the bed. The bed is also quite uncomfortable unless you are quite light as the mattress isn't very sturdy and we were aching after each night's sleep. The room also lacks storage facilities with only two very small drawers and a tiny hanging area with only four hangers - we asked for more but were only given three extra. The bathroom is also very small and has very little space for toiletries - however, the shower is really good. I am sounding very negative about this hotel but there were lots of positives - everywhere in the hotel was really clean and room service was excellent. Reception staff were really helpful whenever we had questions. There are three lifts and we very rarely had to wait very long for one. There was a free breakfast until 10.30 with juices, coffee and tea, toast, rolls and croissants as well as bananas and apples. Tea and coffee were available for free all day in that area and there was a lovely place to sit outside. We loved the location as it is where the locals live and shop so it was really interesting - however, some of the apartments weren't very pleasing on the eye and this was our view from our hotel room window. There is no MTR near the hotel (although one is being built) but the hotel provides free hourly shuttles to Kowloon and Hung Hom stations where you can catch the MTR trains. We caught the local bus - the 5C - down to Tsim Sha Tsui which is where the bars and restaurants are and the bus journey was really interesting though took about 25 minutes depending on the traffic. That bus also takes you right down to the Star Ferry terminal where you can get ferries over to Hong Kong Island and Central and Wanchai piers - that was really worth doing as you get to see the Hong Kong skyline which is amazing, especially at night when it is all lit up. The hotel allowed us to check out at 2 rather than midday which was great - we asked about a later one but it would have been 770 HKD just to have the room until 6 which we thought was too expensive.Verdict? Think the rooms would be great if you were staying for just a couple of nights rather than a week as we did as the lack of storage facilities became irritating as the week went by. Also, perhaps the bed would be more comfortable if you were shorter and lighter than we are - also, as I said, it is better set up as a twin as a double. Great staff there and the standard of cleanliness is excellent. Nice breakfast and seating area. Very modern hotel.","November 19, 2018","13    iclub Ma Tau Wai Hotel

However, there was one thing I felt kind of disappointed. When I asked if borrowed a plug adapter, the guy at the front said “No.” Instead, he said I could get it from a vending machine on site. It was HK$50. I was standing in front of the vending machine for a while and wondering if I bought it. Then another hotel employee at the parking lot talked to me and told me I could get it for only HK$10 at the local store.

819,"We had the misfortune of staying at this hotel last weekend as part of a Webjet tour of China. It was our last hotel of the tour. All previous hotels had been of a high standard. This is rated as a four star hotel. First impressions were of a an extremely small lobby with 2 people manning the desk. Second impression was of our room which didn’t have enough floor space for 2 regular sized cases. Third impression was of the queen sized bed which was actually a double bed pushed up against the floor to ceiling window 17 floors up. But on arrival in our room the smell. Stale cigarettes. This is a non smoking hotel. So off we went back to the small lobby with our luggage to complain to be given another room only to find the same problem. We were then given our third room and one of the 2 gentlemen came with us to check. Finally a room that had no stale cigarette smell. We decided to go downstairs to get something to eat and/or drink, but no facility like the other hotels on tour this except a vending machine, a kettle, microwave and some mixed nuts with paper cups and paper plates. Four star? I don’t think so. Breakfast was a limited choice of 2 juices, teabags, instant coffee and croissants and of course all on paper plates, cups and plastic knives. In the room at night the only way to stop the cold air from the airconditioner to stop blowing on my neck as to turn it off. I didn’t have enough room to sit on the toilet. I’m not 6 foot.

823,"The hotel is OK, apart from the tiny rooms with terrible noise isolation and the questionable modern design. However, we were very disappointed by the breakfast - half an hour before closing time there was nothing left to eat apart from toast and coffee. Moreover, only disposable plates, cups and cutlery are available - like in a cheap motel. Not very eco friendly. For some reason, during our entire breakfast a single, annoying song was running on loop. ","April 5, 2018","13    iclub Ma Tau Wai Hotel

826,"The hotel was built last year and it's bright, clean and stylish. However the staff are too young and inexperience in the hospitality industry. They don't look at you when you talk and they never had a smile on their faces, which I think it's very important for the impression of a hotel. Never heard a thank you, welcome or good morning, they just don't care. The most ridiculous thing is, the staff told me the check out time is 3pm in the afternoon (which was also advertised in the hotel), on the day I left I was taking a nap in my room and suddenly someone open my door with their keycard at 12:50pm. They said they just wanted to check if I wanted to extend my stay or checking out. I just cannot believe what happened, lucky I was not sleeping naked otherwise it would be a disaster. I have never written any review about any hotels I have stayed and to be honest, I would rather pay a little bit more and stay elsewhere, rather than having someone to open my door anytime they want.","March 27, 2018","13    iclub Ma Tau Wai Hotel

827,"I stayed for around two weeks in this location, which is my first. I did stay in other iClub and Regal hotels in Hong Kong and I am always quite happy with my stays.Location: This hotel is situated in a so-so neighborhood which I believe was mostly factories and older apartment buildings. It is very convenient if you use HK buses and mini-vans, the A-22 bus stop from the airport is about a block away. There will be a MTR station nearby opening in 2018. There are many local restaurants nearby as well as a 24-hr MacDonald's and Welcome Supermarket. The hotel also runs a free shuttle to Hung Hom and Kowloon stations every two and one hours respectively during the day. Room: standard iClub size with fridge, safe, TV and two single or one double beds, although bed is on the hard side. I don't believe this hotel has bigger rooms to upgrade. Internet in the room was good and water was hot and the pressure was strong.Service: The check-in, check-out was fast and efficient. Belinda and Oscar on the front desk were very helpful and pleasant to deal with. Since I stayed for about two weeks with discount, there were only twice weekly room services. However, you can ask for water, towels, etc. if you need them. The cleaning staff was very polite and professional. They also included one do-it-yourself free laundry per week on the second floor.Breakfast and hot beverages: Breakfast is a simple continental breakfast with bread, croissant, apple and banana. Coffee and tea makers are available 24 hours a day. I don't consider this is a touristy area but I heard recently some of the old factories were converted to hostel type accommodations which are mainland tourist favorite, you do see a few mainland tourist buses cruising around. All-in-all, if you don't care about a little older neighborhood (very safe) this is a good place to stay.","March 23, 2018","13    iclub Ma Tau Wai Hotel

829,"I appreciate the early check in at 1pm considering we had our small kids with us. I find it odd though that they did not check us in at the executive lounge knowing we are booked at the executive floor. Also they would not accept a different credit card for the deposit other than the one used at booking. First time I experienced it. Check out was the fastest I have ever done. Good job! They also got us a cab to the airport (fare hkd 290)Booking the executive room is the best. We love spending some time at the lounge. Food was great, different each day, plus unlimited drinks. Very good deal. Breakfast is also good. Almost the same menu everyday, but we are not complaining.Staff were a bit stiff to be honest, but there are a few who are friendly and smiles and greets guests.Location is perfect! Do not think twice if you want to be in the center of everything.Wish we had spent more time in the hotel. The pool is inviting but we did not have enough time.

832,"Great value right in the middle of Tsim Sha Tsui. The pool area is spartan (no hot tub or kids area), but enjoyable. My only issue is that this hotel makes it difficult to book a specific room configuration through partner booking services. From reading other reviews, this is not uncommon. We booked this hotel for a family of 7 because they have rooms with 2 beds (queen+double, or double+double). But these rooms are apparently given the same type as their 1-king configurations. Makes it highly unpredictable when checking in, and they had no immediate availability for the room we needed. Fortunately, the front desk staff tried to be accommodating and helpful. We had a 5 night reservation and they were able to split us on different levels for a couple of nights with one of the king rooms until more suitable options opened up.","July 2, 2019","14    Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hong Kong

If you are tourist in HK, it's no doubt one of top choices; - The room is not too tiny, quite clean; but there is no view when looking out of window as all high buildings surrounding; - Check-in and check-out is very fast, and room service is quite good anytime when you calling for; - The breakfast is just ok, nothing impressed. I only had once, then all went out to have local DIM-SUM, which is perfect; - The price is very reasonable if comparing to other hotels just nearby; Overall, it's very good hotel in HK with great location, nice service and acceptable charge.","June 28, 2019","14    Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hong Kong

835,"We stayed in this hotel from 13 June to 18 June 2019. My sister in law booked this hotel for us. There is free shuttle bus from MTR to the hotel. The Lobby looks decent and grand. Upon check in, the counter told us that they do not have our booking...Found our booking after a more experienced staff taken over. We were given room number 404 and 406. The room seem to have some minor touch up reno done to suit the modern needs of traveler but still it is unlike the pictures as shown by others. Am not too sure is it because we booked the rooms without breakfast and was given such or otherwise. (Toilet looks old with two knobs for hot and cold water.) Old wooden doors and cupboard. The lobby hotel staff looks unfriendly everytime we pass by. Probably I would try other hotels if back to Hong Kong. Oh and by the way the room I am in 404 is very noisy at night.

The location of the Hotel is excellent with MTR in close vicinity and excellent market near the Hotel .The hotel staff is very polite, the rooms however need a little make over .There are a lot of good tourist spots near the hotel ""Avenue of stars"",Hongkong Museum .The Hotel provided a Phone through which could remain connected and didn't have to buy any other Internet source in Hongkong. We requested Hotel to pack our breakfast as we had an early morning flight and we got our breakfast packed as requested on time at 4.30 Am in morning. One point which i would like to highlight here is the Taxi arranged by the Hotel to Airport TK 6519 highly overcharged us .He took 90 dollars extra on top of metre reading(metre reading was 240 dollar and he demanded 330) and would not let us go until we paid this . We had to give him 330 dollars in spite of meter reading 240. He boldly said complain to Hotel if you want.We took pictures of the taxi as we felt highly overcharged.Except this experience ,the overall stay was excellent and I would highly recommend the hotel .","June 21, 2019","14    Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hong Kong

Tight but not as tight as we had expected - 2 x doubles. Level 11 in a refurbished room.

Unfortunately, we left on a rather sour note as prior to leaving for the airport, we asked if we could please have a key to the toilet to change and freshen up as there are no toilets in the lobby. The gentleman(?) said we could use the facilities at the health club for a quick bathroom stop and change for the plane. He held the lift for us and said just walk up one flight of stairs at the top....we did and all the doors were locked, the pool, the health club, the toilets. Went back down to the lobby and he was furious and advised that we should just ask someone up there. After I advised that there was no-one up there, he slammed his pen down marched to the elevator, slammed the 16th floor button and was quite aggressive. When we got up there and he realized that there was no-one there to let us use the toilets, he swore loudly under his breath, swiped us in and left in a huff. Honestly, this 10 minute exercise to use a toilet was absurd. We had a wonderful stay at this property, we'd stay again however the performance at the end was so unnecessary and left us feeling rather sad and disappointed. The rain that whole afternoon had been torrential and we simply wanted to use the toilets to change into dry clothes for our flight - the mezzanine toilets would have more than sufficed. My children couldn't understand what we had done wrong. I assured them we had done nothing wrong and that the cranky man on reception must have had a rotten day.","April 22, 2019","14    Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hong Kong

862,"Booked a 2 double-bed deluxe room for a 4D3N stay. I normally would stay in Hong Kong Island due to familiarity but decided to try a hotel at TST for a change. Check-in was a breeze. As we were IHG members, we were each provided a welcome drink voucher. I was expecting a very small room; however we were pleasantly surprised that the room was fairly decent sized. The room could still accommodate a study desk, 2 arm chairs with a small round coffee table and decent space for 2 luggages. However, while well appointed, the room is quite old and a refurbishment would be very much welcomed. Location is very good as it is just next to one of the exits to TST MTR station. There are also quite a number of restaurants(cha chan teng) around and there is a small mall (isquare) opposite of the hotel. During cooler seasons, you could also take a short walk to harbour city shopping mall. Would definitely consider staying again the next time I visit Hong Kong with my family.","April 13, 2019","14    Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hong Kong

Theres nowhere quiet in Hong Kong so you have to accept what you get. First visit was on the 6th floor facing back. Good room, clean and well equippped. Three or four restaurants there, and we eat in the Italian which was excellent. Easy check in and check out, friendly helpful staff. On the second visit we arrived around 8 am, obviously 7 hours to early to check in due to early flight. They took our cases in, checked us in and told us to come back at midday. When we arrived back they upgraded our room free of charge to one on the 14th floor. One of their newly appointed rooms apparently. Excellent room, and the cases came up shortly after we arrivedHong Kong is a bit in your face, to say the least. It was nice to have all the amenities in the hotel (more peaceful) when we needed it.

874,"We just came back from a 3D2N trip to Hong Kong and stayed at the Holiday Inn Golden Mile. We chose the hotel due to its location and proximity to the MTR station. We loved being in the heart of everything. Shops and dining options were easy to go to and we had no trouble finding what we needed or were in the mood to eat.We requested for connecting or adjacent rooms since we were travelling with the kids, and they were able to get us a couple of rooms on the 4th floor. We would have wanted a single bed for one room (our room), but none was available (not a big deal). Though not the newly renovated rooms, our stay was quite pleasant. The size of the rooms were adequate for our needs, the beds were comfortable (though one of the mattresses was sagging in the middle, again not a problem as we didnt have any trouble sleeping), and most importantly the rooms were clean and did not smell musty. No trouble with the bathrooms either.On the second day, we decided to request for the latest possible check out time and we were told that the latest they could hold the room for us was 12:30PM. Since our flight was at 7PM, we decided that we would pay the half day rate and keep one room. Phoned guest services and the person on the other line informed me of the rate and told me that if I was ok with that, I could go down and sign some papers. I went down to the front desk and was attended to by Franky. He explained the rate to me and suggested another option. His suggestion was to we keep the 2 rooms and check out at 4PM, with breakfast at the club lounge. The rates he gave was a little higher than the rate to keep one room til 6PM, but it was a total no-brainer. So I went with his suggestion. Eric, the lobby manager was equally helpful and accommodating. Kudos to Franky and Eric, great customer service.I highly recommend the hotel and we will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Hong Kong.","March 3, 2019","14    Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hong Kong

Bathroom was also big enough and everything was clean, there is a small sitting corner with 2 chairs and a low table but no desk to work on a laptop. The room was facing the street and in the very early morning hours a lot of shouting to be heard (seems to be truck drivers unloading goods in the street ). The walls are thin and I could hear the neighbours very well. At check in they had a wrong address on the registration form and I asked them to correct it. At check out it was still the incorrect address and I told them I needed my bill to show my address and not one in China. Somehow the person doing the check out got annoyed by the request telling me that it would take a long time to update ... As I insisted to have my address on it he disappeared to a back office without a word and when he came back it was done but he was clearly unhappy and very unfriendly, not saying one word to me for the rest of the check out. For the location I can recommend the hotel but for the staff seems to be depending on the mood.","February 21, 2019","14    Holiday Inn Golden Mile Hong Kong

It is very near the MTR station so very accessible. The welcome drink was such a nice gesture and the ambiance in the Haris Bar is very relaxing. Fit to cap the night after a tiring merry-go-round in the ever busy HK streets. Staff are nice, except the one who assisted us during check-out, who is quite snobbish and was such in a hurry to check us out. LOL! The room is surprisingly big and the beds are nice.

It started to rain (common in HK) and it wasn't even possible to get an umbrella from the concierge. They offered a disposable plastic rain coat. Really? In 25 years this is the first full service brand hotel that can't give an umbrella to their guests. Insane!I mentioned this to the duty manager and again upon checkout, requesting some follow up from management without any response. Filed a complaint with the Ambassasor Service!I also discovered that the front desk didn't use the previously made pre-authorization from the credit card to process the payment.

Friendly guest relations (even though sometimes I dont understand what they are saying ) but I really had an enjoyable stay here. My key highlight of this hotel is they provided a mobile set in-room in which you can used anywhere. Simply to say, the gave u a mobile phone to use. Free of charge. And u cam share the internet with mobile hotspot as well. So, staying in this hotel will save you on your mobile charges.","January 17, 2019","15    Hotel Sav Hong Kong

The room was small, as expected in HK, but was immaculate. Despite being on a busy road, the rooms are super quiet, windows are 100% sound proof. Their check-in time is in the afternoon but having reached in an early morning flight, they let me have my room much earlier on request, as soon as the house-keeping completed.

We bought tickets for the buffet breakfast, and they served the exact same menu each day. By the 3rd day we were already bored of the food.

901,"Good points:- Location - around 5-8 minutes walk to Whampoa MRT. Whampoa area has good fashion shops. There is another MTR station near to it but we opt to take Whampoa instead. Only few transfers to HKG island and Disney.Currency exchange shops are also near but across the street.From cheap to a bit pricey food shops / resto are located from MTR to the Hotel. Make sure you pass by the back street always to find these food shop. Good thing there is a Jollibee branch also nearby. If you booked a city tour, shuttle bus can usually pick and drop you off near or next to the hotel.- Free Mobile Phone with DATA! : Maybe one of the new innovations of these kinds of hotels is this phone. With free minutes to some countries and most important is the mobile data. A big help during roaming around HKG.- Free Mini Bar - Drinks were free / soda / water / juice! But not refillable.- Bfast Buffet - Good selection from Noodles / rice / Continental choices - but same menu for 3 days..- Language Barrier - Not much issue there .. staff can speak English which can be understood well- Concierge Team - Very helpful with bags and booking our shuttle service back to the APT. They also suggests to go via taxi to save some bucks and this was helpful to other pax. But we were forced to take the shuttle service which was a bit expensive than the taxi coz we needed the receipt for the reimbursement. Taxis dont have receipts. And it was excellent coz we had our own mini van all to ourselves!- WIFI - Available in all areas / Signal is good and fast. I still got connected even after Check out!Not so Good points: - Room - I think most of this trendy / stylized hotels have smaller rooms?? We were 2 adults and 1 child and the room was just enough for us to move around with 4 pcs of luggage. Hallway is a bit narrow. Reception is located on the 2nd level so better leave your bags with the concierge if you arrived early.- Check in/out timings - Hopefully thay can change the timings ... Check in is 1500 >pls change to 1400 at least? And Check out is 1100 > possible to change to 1200??We arrived around 1400 and room is not yet ready (probably they are fully booked) We were asked to come back by 1500. we returned by 1515 but the lady handling us in the reception said the room will be ready in another 40 mins. Good thing she checked with the lovely girl next to her and she was able to get us a room immediately. Wished I got her name! She saved the day for us!- Bfast Buffet coupons - We stayed 3 nights with 3 pax / Hopefully they can find a new system in handling Bfast Buffet coupons: total 9 coupons / 3 per day / 1 cpn for child and 2 cpns for adults / with corresponding dates! Be careful not to mix them up!- Shuttle Bus to the Hotel - I thought the Bus will go directly to the hotel but you are sharing it with other pax on separate hotels. We first dropped pax on 5 hotels before we were dropped .. we were the last one. But Shuttle back to the Airport was smooth as we were the only pax and taken by our own MB mini van!- 2000HKD deposit- I dont know if this is for all pax but hotel was booked by our Travel Agency because of Club Membership. They said it will be returned after 2 weeks... thats a bit long.. up to now the amount hasn't been credited back.","November 6, 2018","15    Hotel Sav Hong Kong

902,"I did a booking on 10th Oct for a night stay at this hotel on 14th Oct via a travel website but I keyed for 15th Oct instead. This booking was non-refundable but I told the hotel that I was willing to top up the difference to amend to 14th Oct. Instead of accepting an extra income for the hotel, the hotel rejected the top up and insist I will forfeit the room if I do not show up. I have checked the availability of the same room or even the premier ones and there were many available. Hence I felt this hotel was very unreasonable. I would advise travelers who are thinking of booking this hotel to give a 2nd thought as the hotel can be equally nasty to any errand booking. With such attitude of willing to lose a customer, I believe if there is any unpleasant incident in your stay, you are likely not to get any positive response from them during your stay.","October 11, 2018","15    Hotel Sav Hong Kong

This room has a great view toward Whampoa area, even a bit of harbor view with the Kai Tak cruise terminal also known as the old Kai Tak airport. This is my second stay in 2 years at Hotel SAV. The manager was very kind and upgraded us to this theme room. As you can see in the pictures. They go out of their way of decorating, making you feel like in a tropical location somewhere in South Pacific. I found the room to be very comfortable, cozy and clean. The only issue I had is it tends to stay warm during the day even with AC full blast. Overall my experience at Hotel SAV has been fantastic. The staffs are courteous, friendly and dedicated.

We purchased Octopus cards at the airport and used these instead of cash which covered buses/MRT also Star ferry and some shops ( $150HKD Octopus loan card and refunded money on return -$9 admin) The stops outside hotel is number 14. On return to airport, you need to go to the stop down the road on same side towards MTR station. MTR was close, we used E23 to go to Buddha Cable Car ( stop down road).

So it is impossible to get the room temperature higher. Initially I thought the thermostat was faulty and ask the front desk to check, a few minutes later a lady from housekeeping shown up and told me ""there is no heating in any hotel in Hong Kong"".I found that very interesting, even my local friends found that unbelievable.The room's sound proof is minimum, I could easily hear the conversation from next rooms.A very interesting observation was guests like to engage loud conversation at the corridor with their room door opened. maybe because the rooms are too small to fit in all of them.I can confirm the fact the lifts were slow and small, better avoid during morning check out peak hour.The staffs are in general very helpful.If the ground floor has better signage to let guests know where is the reception and the Chinese restaurant would be better, as when I was waiting for my shuttle bus to the airport, I was asked about direction 5 times in 30 mins.I'll stay again if the weather is no cold.","February 18, 2018","15    Hotel Sav Hong Kong

Many hotels that suited my budget had horrendous reviews claiming them being cramped and dirty - and the ones that looked nice and presentable were too expensive - even if they were rather simple and not some five star establishments. Sav was one of the two mid-range ones I stayed in and I am happy that I did. Even though it's not as central to hustle and bustle of Mong Kok, it's still in a good location and the hotel itself is fabulous, especially if you get to stay in one of the upper floors. It's also meticulously clean, modern and not as cramped as some of the reviews will let you believe. I loved the modern decor and the natural light in the rooms. Something to grumble about?

It as close to disgusting.Frustration 2. Hotel management urgently need to redesign the elevator traffic flow. More than one I had to wait for lifts for beyond 10mins. The same set of 3 lifts that transport everyone from ground floor entrance to first floor lobby and 25th floor of room. It was a pain point. Add on with some less considerate hotel guests ...Frustration 3. I was having difficulty to communicate in English with some hotel staff.

Had I asked for a favour to check in early I can accept, but legitimately after formal check in hour and casually being told so, no formal apology no compensation.

The bed is pretty hard and although we had a smoking room the windows did not open at all so we could not smoke even if we wanted to.The rooms could do with a fresh coat of paint as they are looking a little tired. They provide you with a mobile phone but we were too scared to use it as the cost of loss or damage was not worth the risk.The hotel is located just a 5 minute walk to Wampoah MTR anf there are plenty of shops and eateries nearby.The biggest disappointment was that despite knowing we were checking out at 6.00am they did not make provisions for breakfast or even a cup of coffee. Breakfast normally started at 6.30am so for the sake of a few minutes they could have provided a better customer experience rather than a flat NO when I asked for a drink.I doubt if I will return to Hotel SAV on my next trip to Hong Kong it was not very inspiring.,"November 14, 2017","15    Hotel Sav Hong Kong

927,"I stayed here on two separate nights pre and post a cruise. The rooms were spacious and bigger than other rooms I have stayed in in HK, at a much reduced rate. Depending on the configuration, one room seemed more spacious than the other, but both were certainly adequate space wise. The bed was comfortable, the air conditioning cold ( a bit too cold at times ), the shower area spacious, the water hot and good pressure. There is a small fridge with included free water and one soft drink / fruit juice. The wifi easily connected and worked well. I did not eat here so cannot comment on the food. The hotel only has 3 elevators which can make the wait a bit long some times but that's a minor issue. The staff were all very nice and friendly with good English and they looked great in their white bottoms and coloured tops. Check in and check out was streamlined and no problems.The young men in concierge were lovely on both visits, helping with getting a taxi, keeping me up to date when the airport bus was running late, opening doors and helping with luggage. The hotel is close to two subway stations. There is a shopping centre down the road and plenty of convenience stores close by. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at Hotel Sav and would certainly stay here again.","September 29, 2017","15    Hotel Sav Hong Kong

Bed was comfortable. However, rooms were very humid, if AC was on low then the room felt very stuffy.Concierge very helpful in letting us know where the closest laundry facilities were and how to get to other places.Check out was fast tooVery good Chinese restaurant on site.Elevator very small.However, can't say will go back, the location is a bit out of the way, even within reasonable distance to 2 subway stops, it was just too hot to walk on the street. The neighbourhood is an old one, however with a lot of food choices.

930,"We arrived in Hong Kong very early on Saturday morning on a flight from Frankfurt.We had booked a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel which ended up being quite expensive. We checked in immediately, but were unable to get our rooms until 3pm which made things very difficult as we were very tired from a very long sleepless flight. Luckily we were able to check our bags in with the concierge and go exploring for the day. We called the hotel a couple of times to see if our rooms were ready early (having explained our situation) however we were not given access until the 3pm check in time. While this is their official check in, we have stayed at many hotels who go out of their way to get the room ready early, so we felt this could have also been accommodated in this instance. The room itself was very small - but that was to be expected here, where space is a premium, and the room was very clean and modern. The air-conditioning worked very well and the bed was comfortable. We had the 19th floor and the view was not too bad, once the lights all came on. Breakfast was lovely and our server was very excited to talk to us about his country and what we could see there (I think his name was Tony) He was very helpful and it was nice to chat to a local. There was a free shuttle bus available to us, but we had to work that out for ourselves. It would have been really good to have been told about it by the reception staff on the morning we arrived, as we had no idea where we should go and being so very tired it would have cut out a lot of walking. The location was very good and gave us the opportunity to see both the old and new within a very short walk of the front door. Would I recommend it to others? Yes, as long as you don't want to check in early and look downstairs with the concierge for the free shuttle times and pick up locations.","August 22, 2017","15    Hotel Sav Hong Kong

959,"I have stayed here on about six occasions and have had multiple disappointing experiences. I have only kept (grudgingly) coming back because it is so close to my work. If you have any other options, I strongly encourage you to consider them. --I needed help scanning a very important document for my work at 3:00am (after their business center was closed). The man at the front desk refused to help and went back to watching a movie on his phone. Mind you, this was a scan, not a copy (i.e. It costs the hotel $0, especially at 3:00 am when the lobby is empty and nobody is checking in). --I went on a few day long trip away from Hong Kong and planned to return to the hotel afterwards. I took the hotel bus to the airport express station in Kowloon. Upon my return to Hong Kong, I planned to take that same bus back to the hotel. I went outside 30 minutes before the scheduled departure time at the same place it dropped me off at a few days earlier and the bus never came. Upon calling concierge, they said the bus had arrived at the scheduled time and already left. This is false. The area where the bus stops is not crowded at all so it would be inconceivable to miss one of the few busses coming into that area. Do not rely on this bus. A couple of smaller negatives about the hotel:--You WILL get a twin bed room if your travel agent does not guarantee room type. Among my roughly six stays, I have tried calling ahead, checking in at the earliest possible time, and leaving a note with my travel agent. All but one time I received a twin bed room. I'm convinced there are very few full size bed rooms in this hotel. --They charge for luggage storage. Keep this in mind if you want to take a trip for a few days away from the hotel. This is unheard of at any reputable hotel brand (think Hyatt, Marriott, Holiday Inn, etc... ).--General unenthusiastic attitude. Staff are a bit cold. I'd recommend that they be a bit more welcoming at check-in or at the door.

I told the manager, my request is simple. I want to have a pleasant environment for taking rest, is this an unreasonable request? This hotel cannot provides you basic hotel requirements, sleep well and taking rest is not a allowed even in your room. And hotel encourage others making noise in late night and early morning in public area. This is the real case and I cannot sleep again. The noisy people only stay 2 nights while I don’t know why people will stay only 2 nights for making noise in corridor. Hotel manager concept is weird, he did not treasure long stay and punctual guest, they welcome noisy and rude guest. If you want noisy and weird hotel, this is the one you have to choose, I have many years of hotel stay experience and this hotel can rank “top 1 noisy weird hotel in the world”","March 24, 2018","16    Dorsett Kwun Tong, Hong Kong

As the hotel in Hong Kong is well known to be small, this hotel room is considered spacious with the affordable price. And there are 2 TV in the room, since this is a family room.The hotel location is convenient, however, it's not near to any MTR station. The nearest station (Olympic) is around 15min walk. And the station is quite many stations away from MongKok, Central stations. However, the station is just few stations away from Disneyland and TungChung (NgongPing360). Anyway, there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel to few attractions, such as LangHam Place and Star Ferry, etc. So, it's not that difficult for us to get to Mongkok MTR station. Just take note that, the shuttle is quite overwhelming, so make sure you are there at least 15-20min in advance to grab a seat.Food wise, there are quite a lot of restaurants nearby the hotel. By walking distance, you can reach to quite a lot of restaurants and cafe. Mini market and convenient shops are available within walking distance.Overall, the hotel is value for money and is a good choice for family.

A room for two is a bit smaller than what it looks like on the website but very clean. Toothbrush, body lotion, shaving and sewing kit etc are provided. Bedding is very comfortable and the room well isolated so you are ensured to have a good night of sleep! The second time I stayed there (alone) was as great as the first time. I had some breakfast coupon - which you can use from 7 am to 10 pm in a restaurant nearby which does English-style food. Since it is not in the most touristic area, prices around the hotel are fairly cheap. One of the assets of this hotel is the free shuttle bus which stops by (among others) the Ladies Market, Kowloon station, and the ferry pier.

We actually started off looking on the bed before we slept in it. The staff was nice and the room was clean. When we came to our first room it had a smell of smoke. But they were quick to help us to another room. All rooms are smoking prohibited, but, they can't control their guests. I have seen in another hotel how a man several times smoked indoors even though it was perfectly clear that it was prohibited. So yeah. The bed was not to comfy, it was sunk in in the middle. But, like our last mistake in Wanchai we did not alert the staff and just slept in it anyway. We are just very tired people and didn't bother, even if it did bother our sleep, unfortunately.

The location of the hotel is great, walking distance from Olympic MTR and also, a lot of interesting local restaurants nearby which we dined in at. We hopped onto the shuttle bus alot to explore the attractions, however we experienced a bad shuttle bus ride late at night. The driver drove really fast and that send us off our seats but nevertheless, all the other shuttle bus rides were great! The room we had is wonderful and well equipped with all essentials. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to my friends! We will definitely choose Dorsett MongKok again :)","June 19, 2019","17    Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong

1008,"We stayed in this hotel on a first time visit to Hong Kong. The hotel itself was a perfect location for access to good restaurants and shops. Staff appeared friendly. To our astonishment, we discovered two weeks later that fraudulent activities have occurred on the credit card which was used exclusively to pay for our stay. We referred the suspicious activities to our Bank who has since taken the necessary action. We do not in any case blame the Hotel management as we believe this could be the action of a dishonest staff member, possibly at the reception where they tend to be people who have access to customer's credit card details. It is disappointing as we are frequent travellers and this is first time this had happened to us. We hope similiar experience has not happened to others.","June 18, 2019","17    Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong

1009,"I stayed at the Dorsett Mongkok for two nights after a last minute change of plans. Although it might not seem very central I actually much preferred the location to the previous place I was staying in Causeway Bay. It was easy to walk to both Olympic and Mongkok MTR stations, and were a lot of interesting local restaurants and businesses near by.The rooms are on the small side, but still generous compared with Hong Kong norms. The value was exceptional, especially when considering the generous discounts to the restaurants, and the very reasonable price of the minibar.What stood out to me though was the staff - I was caught out by a tropical storm, without umbrella or raincoat, when about to walk to the airport bus station. A staff member offered an umbrella, even after I explained that there would be no way for me to return it. A small gesture, but to me highlighted their genuine care towards their guests.","June 13, 2019","17    Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong

1018,"We originally booked for 2 single beds via Hotel.com for 1 adult and 2 tweens age 14. The receptionist Mikki was very helpful by advising us that the single beds are too small and we might not be comfortable. She offered the family room at a promo rate which is two rooms with 3 beds at the topmost floor, with 1 free night and 2 free days of breakfast. We availed of the upgrade offer and we made the right decision -- we were overlooking the Hongkong City at the topmost floor, the room was clean, smells nice. Everybody was helpful. The toiletries inside the shower smelled so good and looked so nice. The location was near McDonalds' , 7-11, Mannings and a 5 minute walk away from the train station, Olympic City Station. There is also a schedule of the shuttle bus if you want to go to popular destinations and bus going to airport express train. If you are picky with breakfast and have kids, the menu might not make youhappy because of limited choices (no pancakes for kids or sunny side up) but there is nearby McDo for breakfast option anyway. The hotel lobby looked elegant and everybody was helpful even housekeeping which supplied us with power adaptors to charge our electrical gadgets. The room is also equipped with phone with wifi hotspot you can take with you for your trips which complimented our rented wifi when we split into groups during tours. Over-all, we loved our stay in Dorsett and would book again when we return. Thank you Mikki and the rest of Dorsett staff !","May 30, 2019","17    Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong

It is near Olympic and Mong Kok MTRs, allowing easy travel to many places within Kowloon and HK. Hotel also provides complimentary shuttle to major locations and sightseeing spots. They offer a list of restaurants in the neighborhood for guests who want to try local cuisines, with quick references down to the walking distance from the hotel. Good view from our hotel room. Room size is comfortable; mattress firm enough and nice amenities. All rooms are equipped with a complimentary smart phone for guests with no calling charges to certain countries, very helpful when we need to call our HK friends and even back home. Staff speaks excellent English and are very kind and helpful. We visited HK at a very crowded week of the year and stayed 12 nights. No matter how busy, the staff are always courteous and prompt. We want to especially thank Miki Mak and Stephanie Giffin, the front desk staff we asked the most. We are unfamiliar with Kowloon and HK, and they saved us a lot of time and hassle. They both seem genuinely want to make sure all guests have the best time ever. We are amazed at how professional and patient they both are. We travel a lot, and rank this hotel as one of the best we stayed in. We definitely will book this hotel in our future visits to HK!","May 16, 2019","17    Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong

There were some nice little extras that made our stay even more enjoyable, a personal mobile phone which can be used for creating personal wi fi hotspots , a free safe , free fruit on arrival and two bottles of water every day. In the lobby every night there was a candy wagon that gave out free sweets and every Friday there was free wine. There was also a free shuttle bus that takes you to Mongkok, Temple Market and Central every hour. Every staff member we met were very friendly and were always happy to help out with any queries we had.

1035,"The only negative we would give the hotel is the size of the room, with the lack of hanging/storage space for a week's clothing and the fact that the bed was up against the wall so that one occupant had to get in and out from the bottom of the bed! Also we would not rate the size of the bed as Queen, as stated in our booking. I know the management will respond that there are other room sizes, but we went by photos on their website, which are somewhat deceptive.Now the many positives. The room wasn't ready when we arrived earlier than standard check-in time, but the lovely reception staff told us it would only be an hour, and suggested where we could go to get a drink and snack in the meantime. The staff continued to be pleasant and helpful throughout our week, from quickly bringing the extra pillows we asked for (along with a welcoming small plate of fruit) to booking our taxi for the airport at a fixed price so we wouldn't be overcharged. Other added extras were the two small bottles of complimentary water each day, the free sweets stall from 6-7pm each day, the wine and snacks served on Wednesday at this time, too, and the very useful shuttle bus every hour, which got us closer to sights we wanted to see, saving us walking as much in this 'manic' city! We hadn't booked breakfasts, but decided to take it here on our last morning, to save time, and we were satisfied with the food available (though it could have been hotter, but that's hotel buffets!), and with the cost - 50 HKD (£5 GB).The location of the hotel is fine, with lots of restaurants of all types nearby (a MacDonald's opposite if that's your style, but they did do good coffee to go with pastries from the bakeries for our breakfasts). Plenty of chinese cooked food takeaway stalls. Also there's a little 'park' just outside, where we sat to eat our pastries.All in all, would recommend.","May 3, 2019","17    Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong

You can reach it easy from the airport by taking the A21 and being dropped off a 10min walk away.The Dorsett also have a shuttle bus services leaving the hotel every hour on the hour and taking guests to key areas in Mong Kok and down towards the water front. We used the bus a couple of times both to be dropped off and picked up. The hotel itself is excellent! The staff are friendly, the service is excellent too. On Wednesday evenings from 6-7pm, they have free wine and snacks for guests. Every other day at the same time they have sweets available for guests.Our room was small yet well designed. The bed was an inch or two too short for me, I’m 189cm tall. I think that’s more a symptom of Hong Kong’s lack of space.We left on a Saturday and had a check out to 2pm, that’s incredibly generous!

1041,"We just stayed 12 nights at the Dorsett Mongkok and it was wonderful. The location was ideal as it was close to everything. The rooms, though small but apparently typical for Hong Kong, are clean and functional. There are so many extras that this hotel provides. There is a free cell phone in each room which has unlimited data that you can hotspot your own phone to. The hotel shuttlebus runs hourly and has 4 stops that will connect you to the MTR where you can connect to wherever you want to go. They have a candy bar from 6:00 – 7:00 every night and a wine hour on Wednesdays. However, I would have to say that the highlite of this hotel is it’s staff. Everyone including the check-in staff, concierge, maid service and Andrew Lee the Director of Operations, were so friendly and helpful. The standout though, has to be Taro Liew at the front desk!! My daughter is a HUGE fan of Game of Thrones and we arrived in Hong Kong the night before the premiere of Season 8 of the Game of Thrones. We had tried to get access to HBO Asia before we left Canada with no success. We also had no success once we arrived. However, Taro came through literally 10 minutes before the show started. He definitely went above and beyond the call of duty. My daughter is forever in his debt. Taro was such a gem, he was so knowledgeable and eager to help, we went to him with all our queries. When he found out it was our twins 21st birthday, he even arranged to have a cake and wine delivered to their room.We felt so welcomed at the Dorsett Mongkok and will definitely come back when visiting Hong Kong again. Thank you!!","April 28, 2019","17    Dorsett Mongkok Hong Kong

I wish I could of stayed longer. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and friendly she upgraded us up to a family room which was on the top floor. The room itself was beautiful the bed was a dream to sleep in but the view from our window was flawless. Could not fault a thing.

1045,"This was the 2nd time my family has stayed in this hotel but this stay was far better because i have booked my family in to a 2 bedroom suite.What I like about it:-spacious ; each bedroom is ensuite and big. The bedroom accommodates a King Size bed , Study Desk, Big Wardrobe. -Very comfortable bed and pillow -large living room it could sleep a further 2. -Each bedroom and the living room has a large TV-The view is excellent;please refer to pictures-open plan kitchen but kitchen is restricted to microwave cooking only -Location is fabulous; short walk to MTR/Metro/Subway and Bus Station. If you are travelling on the MTR would be best you buy an Octopus Card cause it could be use for paying the bus fare and goods and services at all retailers. If you are taking the Green Bus/Mini Bus beware driver speaks little or no English -The hotel is only 2 stops away to Shatin Station where there are plenty of shops and supermarkets. What dont I like is that the 2 bedroom suite has no washer and dryer so if you are doing a long stay you could enage pick up and delivery laundry service such as Boni. Overall, I would definitely come back to staying in this hotel because this is excellent for small gathering ","July 6, 2019","18    Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Sha Tin

Although it’s just a 10min taxi ride from our home we often visit to enjoy their excellent buffet, pool, SPA, or stay the night. Hyatt Regency Shatin is in much contrast to the very badly and incompetently managed Grand Hyatt on HK Island on which I have walked out twice due to management issues.My compliments to the buffet Chef for the Swiss Cheese fondue and the MELO staff for making my wife happy with the ‘best ever treatment’ she had on Mother’s day. Special thanks to the staff for coming to our room less than five minutes after calling reception for taking our daughter’s temperature which was 40C at the time and accommodating a later check-out to sort the situation.Tip #1Dig under the ice to find the large hidden claws at the lobster buffet.Tip #2Get your drinks at 711 University Station (2min walk)Tip #3Go for a walk (tunnel under University Station next to ticket gates) around the University Campus, including the artificial lake at night.","June 6, 2019","18    Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Sha Tin

1052,When booking this hotel I thought I was booking the Hyatt Regency in Kowloon and soon found out there are two Hyatt Regency Hotels in Hong Kong and I had booked the one in Sha Tin but it turned out to be better than expected. The hotel was newer and the rooms are quite large and the room we got had fantastic views across the Harbour. The Hotel is very 5 star looking and feel. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the bonus there is a free shuttle to take you to the other Hyatt Regency in Kowloon or if you wish you can get off at Kowloon Station so getting around from Sha Tin is easy so I highly recommend you stay at The Hyatt Regency Sha Tin plus you get to see the sights of Hong Kong from the shuttle bus that you would possibly never see staying in Kowloon and I highly recommend you book a Club Room as it is fantastic up there on the 25th floor with fantastic views and fantastic staff. I would rate this hotel as 5 stars in looks and service from the moment you arrive at the front door. ,"May 28, 2019","18    Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Sha Tin

It offers exactly what you'd expect from a Hyatt -- rooms are nice and there are decent coffee, drinks, and dining options right in the hotel -- but you pay the usual high prices for all of that convenience. The location is perfect if you are doing something at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It's not close to much else, and so food/drink options outside the hotel/university are limited if you don't want to get on the metro. The metro stop is right next door, though, and there are lots of great areas 1 - 2 stops away. (The pool is pretty amazing too).","May 20, 2019","18    Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Sha Tin

It was great to go in either direction further up in to the New Territories or into Kowloon. The bar’s signature pomelo cocktail was delicious, but the food service was poor, as it took a long time, and the club sandwich with fries was lukewarm and soggy. Considering the prices, one would expect perfection. The king room was a good size and had a great view, but the carpet looked like it needed a good deep clean.

1093,"I stayed there at least three or four times a year. Overall experience was awesome but what makes this hotel especially special is the staff – far exceeds any five-star hotel, including other Hyatt hotels. I have membership with IHG, SPG and Hyatt – in Hong Kong, Hyatt Regency Shatin is my only choice. Remember these managers' names – Kevin, Godfrey and Steve… they are especially helpful. Here is my two cents: 1 All staff there are incredibly helpful. I left my stuff there, and I got it back during my next visit. I mentioned about the hair dryer… and they gave me a special one. They also let me borrow a heater. I forgot to bring my iPhone cable, and they let me borrow one…2 The managers of the hotel are professional and caring. Every morning, the senior managers say hi to the guests –I don't experience that at other hotels. They don't simply socialize with the guests, but also put in every effort to help them. 3 I mentioned about bad experience with another Hyatt… and they sincerely listened and shared my feedback with their internal folks. 4 I had some issues with my membership points, and they helped me contact the membership center. Though I probably won't get my points back… but I truly appreciate their assistance.","January 31, 2019","18    Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Sha Tin

1095,"This review has been a long time coming, I actually didn't want and avoided posting this but the time has finally come. Stayed here for a couple of days last year with my family and in-laws in a 2 bedroom suite. On our 2nd night while just laying down on the bed watching tv, I got the sensation of being bitten a number of times on my legs. At first I thought it was mosquitoes but I couldn't find any, until I noticed the sort of bites I had. I immediately contacted housekeeping, spoke to 2 different housekeepers as well as the housekeeping department but all they offered me was a change of linens. FYI changing the linens wouldnt matter to bedbugs. I am a former hotel worker and I was incredulous that that was the only solution they had for such a high rated hotel but I didnt want to make a scene since it was already late and my in laws were in the other room. So I just agreed to it and noticed that they actually dont even change the duvet itself (which I suspected afterwards was where the bedbugs came from since I didnt get any more bites), just the cover. I emailed them as well about being bitten and although the duty manager called the room right away in 30 mins, changing of linens still was the only option they gave me, which they had already done. The next day when we checked out, Martin/Marvin, a manager talked with us and apologized, assured us they were going to investigate it and that the next time we stayed they were going to give us an upgrade or discount or whatever. To be honest, and he could probably tell at that time, I really wasn't interested anymore, I was just too disappointed with the solutions they offered me. Bed bugs means a change of the mattress, at the very least. Also, when we had already checked out and on our way to Macau, my parents-in-law were talking about how they had a few bites and were itching a lot in that hotel and just realized about the bedbugs when they heard Martin/Marvin talking to me about it. So it wasnt just me and it wasnt just in one room, although I had the bulk of it with OVER 30 nasty bites. As a WOMAN who wears dresses over 90% of the time, this was very TRAUMATIZING for me. I wish they had just offered an antibiotic cream and a really good scar eraser, as well as a discount on our total bill, for the distress this whole thing gave me as well as the aftermath- I was looking at a couple of months of wearing jeans when I only had a couple of them in my closet. For such a big name hotel, they sure dont know how to do any customer-recovery. And for the record, those nasty bites got infected after a week so I had to visit a dermatologist, which initially cost me USD77, plus another USD31 this month for the 2nd jar of scar cream I have had to use. Its been 3 months and the scars are still ever visible, its embarrassing to be going out in a dress or skirt. Im now looking at 6 months, at the very least, till theyre not pretty noticeable anymore.So, an upgrade the next time we check in? What, will it cost over USD200? To get back the money I lost and the money I will lose by staying and being bitten again by bedbugs in your hotel? No thanks. Never again. I would have sued if I had lived there.","January 30, 2019","18    Hyatt Regency Hong Kong, Sha Tin

1109,"Upon check-in we were apparently upgraded to business suites (2005 & 2004), however upon entry to the room, we joked about what we were upgraded from! The room had a small living/dining area (with room for only 1 chair at the small table) and a tiny bedroom with a bed pushed up against the wall. I know this is Hong Kong and rooms are small, but the space wouldv'e been far better just being one room with a bed, the rest of the space was wasted for us.The room was clean but in much need of a refurb, the curtain was hanging off the rail, the carpet was very grubby and there was a fair bit of mould in the bathroom.There was tea and coffee, but unfortunately no milk.We also only found out all the shampoo and soaps were in the wardrobe (?!) on the day we checked-out, so didn't get to use these.On the upside:Staff were very friendly and professional. They held our luggage for us and booked us a taxi back to the airport.We had two free bottles of appletiser in the room and a bowl of apples.There are snacks and drinks down in the lobby all day.The location (for people, like us, who are completely new to Hong Kong) is great, near lots of good nightlife and bars, however I never realised how hilly Hong Kong island is, so be aware you will be walking up lots of steps or hills in this part of the city. However for us, we are glad we stayed on Hong Kong Island rather than Kowloon, as the nightlife is more to our taste.If you're on a budget, this hotel is perfectly acceptable, however don't expect anything fancy!","May 22, 2019","19    Hotel LBP

1112,"This was our first trip to Hong Kong and we decided on Hotel LBP because of the location and previous reviews.We arrived well before check-in time, and they allowed us to store our luggage there until our room was ready. We booked a business suite because we wanted a little more room than seemed common in this area. We were very pleased with the space; a sitting area with its own TV (with several English channels) and a mini-fridge, along with a small dining area; the bedroom had room to hang clothes, a desk, room to store 2 suitcases,a TV, and a reasonably sized bed. It might have been slightly smaller than a queen (our normal configuration), but definitely larger than just a double, and more than adequate (quite comfy, with plenty of pillows). There wasn't a lot of room at the foot of the bed, which made getting up to use the facilities a bit challenging, but no toe stubbing happened. The bathroom, while small, had good ventilation and enough amenities. If you relocate the toothbrushes, etc, that they supply for you from the small hanging shelf, there is more than enough space for personal toiletries. It is a humid climate, and as such, there was some mold and mildew found around the base of the shower sliding door, but not enough to be troublesome. The blackout curtains did their job, and the room was surprisingly quiet considering the liveliness taking place outside. Although the balcony wasn't large and needed a little love (peeling paint, sad looking plants), we really enjoyed hanging out there, with a view of the park across the way, having a drink at the end of the day). The AC worked splendidly, and every employee we encountered were friendly and courteous. (We also really enjoyed the robes and slippers supplied in the room.) The location was convenient for exploring the area; many local shops, laundromats, coffee shops, and MTR stations are right around the corner. We found no problems with the lobby being on the fourth floor; we used the microwave there to warm up leftovers several times, and the refrigerator full of cold drinks was much appreciated. All in all, a good stay, but not for the folks looking for a 5* experience, as the wear and tear and delayed upkeep of the facility would probably detract from their stay.","May 6, 2019","19    Hotel LBP

1115,"I stayed in both a normal room and a suite. Neither had what I consider to be a queen size bed, and I sleep on one at home every night. The suite in particular was run down and becoming very tired. The couch was badly stained, the small shelf inside the shower recess was loose and everything slipped off, and the towel rack was loose. The TV in the bedroom never worked and the HBO channel in the sitting area kept freezing up. Probably some half-arsed Kodi box! And at times the toilet area smelled. There is no space in the bathrooms to store your own toiletries or a shelf to rest anything on. I missed the ability to have a breakfast in the hotel on those mornings I needed to be up and gone.On the positive side the staff were very good.

The quality of materials in the small pair of rooms is 2* at best, and falling apart at that (see pictures). The bedroom was barely twice the size of the bed. The bathroom tiny. The kitchenette is tiny, without a sink, microwave or cooktop. The tiny refrigerator cannot be opened unless you move one of the chairs. The staff and common area is pretty nice, but that does not make up for a lack of quality in the rooms. Kind of sad that the owners don't fix this old building up.","April 15, 2019","19    Hotel LBP

1119,"We selected the LBP Hotel in HK on advice from a friend who knows the city well. It was a perfect solution.Located in Hollywood Central, it is close to restaurants, markets, temples, a design center, subway, museums, interesting street life/stores and art galleries.The hotel itself is situated in a mixed office/hotel building. The reception is on the 4th floor. We had booked a room for a week a couple of months ahead. When we arrived at the desk they greeted us warmly and said they had upgraded us to a suite, at no extra cost. Wondering why such a gesture had been offered, they told us because we had booked for a whole week. Great news, and what a fine room! A small kitchenette (kettle, toaster etc.) but no cooking. A sitting room with ample furniture and storage and a TV, with a DVD player. This room was very spacious, a welcome treat after 6 weeks in Vietnam, in small rooms. The bedroom was equally generous with space, desk, and ample storage. A very nice bathroom with a great shower topped off the accommodations.Now, on that 4th floor reception area I mentioned, the hotel offered; complimentary Nespresso coffee, tea, snacks, fresh fruit, water and cold drinks. A pleasant sitting area with couch, tables and chairs and a small outdoor balcony invited you to enjoy the coffee and browse the books and magazines on a bookshelf. The books were in several languages, very thoughtful. There was also a big selection of CDs, you could take to your room.There was an adjoining room with massage chairs, a foot massage device and a large TV with a good range of DVD's you could access. There is also a small gym, phone charger, computers etc. All of this is 24/7.To top this of, the staff were incredible. Most of them spoke good English, and their efforts to aid and abet were amazing. They were fun to talk to, but also so happy to go beyond a simple answer to ""How do we get to the Star Ferry terminal?"". At one point three of them were looking for an answer to a question I had about a temple ritual I’d observed! A magnificent experience all around.","April 5, 2019","19    Hotel LBP

Location is great as it's a walkable distance to Central HK, the ferry terminal and HK MTR station which is the airport link, so it's close to almost all mode of transportation. Not noisy like some hotels that are located in the middle of Soho Central too. ","March 23, 2019","19    Hotel LBP

We has a small room with a curiously elevated bathroom and it might have been worth it to upgrade to a larger space but Hong Kong is meant to be explored, not experienced in a hotel room. Stayed on the second floor facing a courtyard so no noticed no street noise whatsoever. One notable bonus was that the shower was a good size and not cramped like many other hotel rooms in Hong Kong. The WIFI worked good and the common area had coffee and cold drinks available for guests. On the downside, the hotel room TV was old and seemed to have connection problems and the bed was a bit too short and small for us. Yet, somehow, this didn't seem to hamper the stay. Perhaps this is because the way in which the employees try to make your stay as pleasant as possible . Would recommend Hotel LBP for a budget-minded traveller.","January 2, 2019","19    Hotel LBP

1163,"We selected this hotel primarily because of its location and the fact we only had 24 hours in Hong Kong. Public transport, food and local life are abundant from the moment you step onto the busy street outside. We had a room on floor 23 with a city view. The room was on a club floor, but we did not have a room with club benefits (by choice). The view was an appreciation of Hong Kong’s density. The room was well appointed with more of an upper-end traveller feeling rather than a business feeling. There was not a lot of room, but at the same time there was plenty of space and larger than we thought it would be for Hong Kong island accommodation. The bathroom is small, but a perfect utilisation of space and the shower had great pressure. The bed was clean with good pillows and we had a great sleep in a quiet space. The common areas (lifts, hallways etc) have the appearance that they get a lot of traffic. It is a very clean hotel, but it is starting to show wear. We booked on-line through the hotel website. We arrived on public transport from the airport and the hotel was easy to get to. Check-in was really straight forward.Breakfast was included in our rate and the fresh made laksa was really good. The coffee was machine produced and ordinary. The fruit selection was fresh and seasonal. We checked out the pool area but did not use it. Excellent space and great views we just wish we had more time and we would have dived in. We had a late flight out of Hong Kong. We paid a half day rate to have the room until 6pm and we thought it was value as it allowed us to have a jam-packed day with some rest and a good shower before a long-haul flight. The hotel location alone is the reason we are giving it 5*. And it is because of the hotels location that it would be our preferred choice should we visit Hong Kong again.","June 1, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

With easy access to the MTR and tram station in addition to the free shuttle service. The service staffs were super friendly and helpful too. I would return to the same hotel for my next visit to Hong Kong.","May 19, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1167,"Had a very comfortable stay at the Jen made even better by the efficient and friendly housekeeping crew.Really enjoyed the club, Ivan and his team made sure that all of their guests were well looked after.The only negative is that the breakfast offering in the restaurant is fairly limited, but it is HK so there are lots of choices for breakfast.","May 18, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1168,I never leave reviews on hotels but thought I would take the time for this one. I booked a room 1 month in advance and made a mistake on the date when confirming online (because of my phone screen). I called the hotel immediately to inform them of the unfortunate mistake and asked for a change in the date (many rooms were available at the date I wanted). They simply refused to change the date or refund and did not suggest any alternative. I was very surprised and did not expect that from a 4 star hotel. I called them many times and my experience of their customer service was terrible. This is not what I am used to even with hotels with loser standards. They just dont care about their customers. The Jen does not match EU standards. This has tarnished the Shangri la brand for me.,"May 17, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

Lucky to have a sea view room, size acceptable, convenient shower and toilets, very clean...Weak points : the area if you are not too used with Asia, you will find less interesting places to have food or to visit. Also escalators were not working so well.Not too far you can go to Sun-Yat Sen park to have a wonderful view on the bay.","May 10, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1170,"Hotel Jen is in the middle of a bustling busy area but the noise level in the hotel is minimal.The start was not very good as we had travelled for over 13 hours and when we got there our room wasn't ready so we had to leave our suitcases and go wandering for a couple of hours and we weren't really in the mood for that after all our travelling.Eventually we came back and they told us it was ready and although the room was quite spacious the carpets in the hallway could have done with a good clean and the room although clean on the surface those carpets could have benefitted from a bit of a clean too.Putting all that aside the room was okay, no sights to see from the window but an elevated road but I wasn't going to sit looking out of the window all day.The second day there the credit type key decided it didn't want to play any more and really messed us about. The maintenance guy couldn't fix it, the guy from reception couldn't fix it but the manager decided to change the battery which was supposed to have been changed a week earlier and that did fix it fortunately.The meals were good very Chinese which is what you would expect in China and the beers were a bit expensive apart from happy hour where it was 2 for 1, guess when we did our drinking?There is a pool on the 13th floor which when you look over the edge sends you a bit giddy the lesson is don't look over the edge. It was a nice pool nicely laid out but the water was a little cold but then it was March.The hotel is within walking distance of a host of eateries, shops and the Chinese way of life, an education I can tell you but you must have a go on the trams that run down the middle of the road. For 2$ 60 you can travel as long as you like and I for one loved it.A decent walk sends you to where you can get a feery to the mainland and that again is an education all by itself.","May 9, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

The hotel is in a very convenient and calm location, in downtown Hong Kong, close to subway and not far from nice toursitic areas (Victoria peak, Soho, antique market, city harbour). Hotel is very clean, well organized, with a delicious breakfast included. The only negative point was that they prepared a room for two people although requested for three.

1173,"Once again chosen thru trip advisor comments. I had real high hopes and left a little deflated. We have stayed in club rooms before so expected a lot more then what we got. Also having stayed in Hong Kong before and being happy in another hotel that felt the same room wise.Check in fast and Check out even faster.The rooms however a little disappointing, we were meant to have a mountain view room, I think we got a cram your neck and may get a sight of the mountain.The room comfortable and clean, however a few cosmetic flaws in the tiles and areas that may need a refresh. The bed comfy but a little squishy for my tastes. Free bottle of water and the usual shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush and paste.Safe available as well as a small fridge.The club lounge is nice. The food at the 530 til 730 nibbles is either amazing or missed the mark. However the staff on the shifts make a mean drink which kept us there Breakfast is very nice but once again either really good parts and really bad parts.Used the lounge after check out until our flight, so enjoyed the free wifi and coffee.The subway right across the road, HKU exit B2 for the people like me who try to do it themselves.We used the pool however it was a cold day (26) and the wind was bad. Would be nice in hotter weather. Food all around and easy to take a walk and look around.Stay here if you don’t want the hustle and bustle of inner Nathan road.Would return but maybe not a club room as didn’t meet my expectations.","April 27, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

It's really very obvious and visible ,I wonder how come the house keeping can over looked it.. the toliet celling is very low, so definitely the first thing u see is the long strand of hair.

1177,"We decided to try out this hotel because we like staying in Shangri-la hotels. The hotel is situated in Kennedy Town on the east-side of Hong Kong Island. The hotel is a stone's throw from Hong Kong University subway station.Check-in was faultless - it was nice that there was someone who greeted us when we got dropped off by the taxi and took our luggage to the foyer. Check-in was very efficient and the front desk was very helpful in answering our questions.We got upgraded to Club Level and we stayed in Room 2311. The room was average sized (by Hong Kong standards) and featured a lovely view of Hong Kong University. The room layout is clever, but may not be to everyone's taste - you walk through the bathroom to get to the bedsitting area - although there are separate doors for the shower and toilet (both small). There is a sliding partition that can be pulled across the room to separate the bedsitting area and the bathroom. We didn't like the dirty toilet seat with water marks!Storage is on the low side with only a few hooks and a very narrow wardrobe. We did struggle to store our luggage (two suitcases, two carry-on cases) and use the room at the same time.The bed was very comfortable and the room's air conditioning worked well. The bed lighting was very nice. Overall, the room was very functional and stylish but not as luxurious as the Shangri-la.Breakfast was nice. Breakfast is hosted on the 2nd floor restaurant and it looks fantastic. There's also a wide (and healthy) selection of things to eat. The staff were very nice and welcoming. We could not fault the breakfast (and we can be fussy).The hotel is in a nice area but guests might feel a bit frustrated by the lack of local amenities. You will have to travel if you want to go shopping or finding something to eat, so it's not in the best location. It's in a friendly neighbourhood but not enough to want to spend time. It's convenient to walk to nearby places like PMQ and Hollywood Road but I guess it's in an area similar to Shoreditch - a cool area but lacks amenities.It's convenient to get to the airport - don't bother getting the shuttle to Hong Kong station, just jump into a taxi and head straight for the airport (it will save you time). Would we stay again? Probably not to be honest. It's a lovely hotel but too far away from local attractions. You would be doing a lot more travelling around to get to places like Causeway Bay, Central and Wan Chai.","April 17, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1178,"We wanted to stay in the hub of Hong Kong so we chose this hotel - what a little gem. The outside doesn’t look too amazing but the reception is very welcoming and the staff very friendly. Check in was easy and rooms lovely and clean - small but typical for city hotels. They have a roof top pool which is a decent size and a good size gym (latter not used by me). The bar area is small and drinks unsurprisingly more expensive than the bars along the street. They do have happy ‘hour’, or ally lasting for two! Breakfast (included) is amazing and caters for all tastes. We spoke to someone staying there who had stayed at the posher hotels and said this was way better with the food and facilities plus you felt you were in Hong Kong not just some other faceless hotel. A stay here will not leave you disappointed, simply the opposite. A 100% recommendation.","April 17, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

Food choices etc were ok : limited food range but quality fine. Area is residential but nice to see a different part of HK away from the shopping malls. Had some great local food.

1181,"This hotel is situated in a dirty and noisy environment in Shek Tong Tsui of the Western District near one of the Hong Kong University MTR exits. The location is convenient, but the pedestrian/ road traffic seems to be messy. The staff are not visitors-friendly at all, and the washrooms in the lobby that were previously used to open to all visitors are now locked with a numerical keypad; and the staff would not grant you the code for access unless you are a current hotel room guest, even if you are visiting someone staying in a hotel room there, or simply wanting to check with the reception desk for their room availability. This could be due to the fact that their washrooms in the lobby were still very dirty like before and were still dirty these days that the staff refused to expose them to the public.","April 13, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

It was a great place to lounge all day and for my husband to rest before our midnight flight. The shuttle bus to Victoria’s Peak was very convenient as well as the hotel being close to the MRT. The train ride from the airport during the day with a transfer to the MRT was easy going to the hotel and in the evening we took a taxi ride back to the airport.

1185,Don’t be put off by the slightly utilitarian aspect of the Jen or the perception that it’s location on Queens RD W has it in an unfashionable area. Due to the proximity of the MTR almost on the hotels doorstep means you are only minutes away from all the main Central places if you are prepared to use HK’s excellent underground system.The rooms are smallish and un inspiringly decorated but adequate in every way with a excellent strong shower and separate WC. The upgrade to Club more than worthwhile with a very pleasant and warmly staffed lounge where a decent breakfast is available and a 2 hour happy hour of free drinks and considerable food is available every evening.Lastly if you like to swim there’s a sizeable lap pool on the roof which all works perfectly next door to a well equipped gym.

Reservation was made directly on the Hotel Jen website where we found better room rates than what was being offered on booking.com for the weekend we were interested in staying here. Email confirmation was received shortly after booking. We were well received upon arrival, check-in was smooth and quick. We were up in our rooms within a few minutes of arriving. Property location is just outside the HKU MTR Station Exit B2, providing good access to other areas of Hong Kong Island. Lots of local eateries and a 711 just outside the hotel. Not much in the form of western dining nearby. However, you are just a couple MTR stations away from Sheung Wan and Central if need be. Rooms are spacious with sufficient closet and luggage space. Room includes work desk, rolling chair, expected safe, ironing board, fridge, kettle, lamps and good lighting. TV, Wifi, A/C all worked very well during out stay. Importantly, beds are comfortable, providing good sleep. Views from our room were just ok. Overall, our room was rather comfortable.There is a rooftop pool and gym with great views of the city. You'll also find a simple lobby bar and Cafe Malacca on the second floor. Hotel provides free shuttle service to places like the Peak, Macau Ferry Terminal, Ocean Park and Disneyland amongst other places. Check the hotel for details.

1197,"After reading several reviews saying the rooms were small that was what we were expecting. It turned out to be fine, not massive but not small either. The room had tea making facilities, free bottled water.It was 2 mins walk from HKU station, so very convenient. We found a nice little bar just around the corner called Salt and Barrel, they did decent food.The area the hotel was in was a typical suburban area. We found it walkable to central but we like walking so probably to far for some. ","February 20, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1198,"My wife and I recently stayed for 3 nights at the hotel. The location is handy, being next door to HKU MTV underground station, and there is a McDonald pretty much next door too (yes I know, but it did come in handy!). Check in was quick, and the room was clean and bright. The air conditioning unit was a bit noisy, and the noise from the fly over outside our 8th floor window and the street noise below did not give a great sleep experience. The bathroom had a bath with shower. There was an in-room safe and a kettle and fridge (plus free bottled water). The most annoying thing about the room, was that there were no drawers, so you had to live out of your suitcase. The staff were polite and helpful. The downside was that we discovered that the swimming pool was unavailable as it was being maintained, so there was nowhere to go and relax. There is a ‘club room’ on the 23rd floor which had a great view, but this is only for ‘Club / Suite’ class guests. From looking at the hotel website I expected this to be available for all guests, so I was disappointed to discover that this was not the case when I got there. There is a bar area in reception, but it is a bit dark and not particularly inviting.So all in all, it was fine, but if I were to return to Hong Kong I ‘d probably look at alternatives.","February 20, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1199,"We stayed for 3 nights as an end to our honeymoon.We upgraded for a city view - I think these rooms are a bit bigger - spacious enough and very clean and comfortable with good amenities. Comfortable bed and great air con. Hotel very kindly arranged a bottle of Prosecco for our welcome which was a nice surprise.Definitely try and get city or even harbour view - just adds to the experience and makes the room feel bigger. Organised the shuttle from the airport with the hotel directly which was easy to arrange by email and was a convenient service. Great location with metro not even a 5 minute walk away and the trams close by. Can walk to the harbour. Great authentic dim sum place across the road from the hotel where all the locals go or if you don't fancy that McDonald's is right next door. Lots of eatery options in area + shopping mall close by.We didn't have meals at the hotel as we wanted to be out and try local things but the restaurant options seemed very good. First time in Hong Kong realised quite quickly that it is easy to get around and the hotel offer free shuttle to a lot of the key tourist areas, we didn't use it as the timings restricted us a bit. Only disappointment was that at the time of our booking we didn't know that the pool was under renovation at the time of our stay and we did specifically book the hotel for the pool option but it's just one of those things.Thank you to Elaine on the front desk for being so friendly and helpful and felt good to have a familiar face to talk to to help plan our stay.","February 5, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1205,"The location on HK island and relatively low price (by HK standards) are the selling points. It is also by a metro station and on thr bus route to the airport. So good for transit passengers, and well located for HKU. But otherwise there is little to sell this place. In line with all HK hotels, it is pricey. Rooms are good but small. The roof top pool, which was a major selling point for me, was closed when we visited. The bar at the top of the hotel has great views over HK but only open for premier guests, or a significant cost for other guests who might just want a drink and the view. So overall it was good but not exceptional, and useful rather than somewhere to recommend.","January 2, 2019","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

The MTR (Exit B2) is very near the hotel as well which makes travelling convenient and fast. Breakfast was amazing as well.If you have children and plan to go to Disneyland, do use the shuttle bus as it is convenient and it is only a 30 minute ride. However, the bus only heads there on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:10am so do not miss it.Also as it was my grandaunt's birthday, the hotel provided us with a cake and personalised greeting which we really appreciate!

There is no free shuttle bus provided by Airport Express to the hotel unlike other hotels. but for limited timing Jen Hotel provides a free shuttle to pick up and send customers to and fro the hotel and airport express station.the club suite is great and the daily breakfast and use of lounge from 630am to 11pm are very welcomed. the daily cocktail from 530pm to 730pm are also well liked as it comes with some hot food. would be great if the breakfast served at the lounge would include bacon. maybe even a return promotion code for customers who are returning as a perk. thanks for the welcome wine and snacks.

Can hear when almost anyone showers, uses a bathroom, the sound of water is constant. Can hear the people in surrounding rooms and in corridors easily. I believe the location is good from a transport point of view if you are confident using the trams/trains etc. Otherwise it’s a taxi almost everywhere. Breakfast buffet offers a range but is isn’t big on the western front. Dinner, lunch menu is limited and restrictive.

1218,"I made an error in booking. I usually avoid basic rooms but ""Superior Twin City View"" sounded rather more than basic. Sadly, it appears to be ""Basic Standard"".My fault for nor reading more carefully.The room was fairly basic and the city views referred to the backs of adjacent buildings. But the bed was comfortable and the pillows good.Housekeeping good.Breakfast good.Front desk staff Good.Reception area a bit jaded.Location. Immediately outside B2 exit of HKU station on the Island Line. 3 stops from Central.Take care to note that the true price requires the addition of 10% tax.I paid about $HK8400 for 5 nights. That's not cheap and not much less than a good quality hotel in Tsimshashui.There are a number of ""popular"" home cooking restaurants in the area but they are not cheap. Most dishes $HK55+.The connection to Central Station is good but Central is large, busy and it feels a long way from, say, the harbour and a good map app or compass app is necessary to avoid walking in circles.The connection from Central to Hong Kong Station for the train to the airport is within fairly lengthy walking distance.HOWEVER, all that said, I'd probably stay there again on my next trip to HK - for the pillows, the mattress and the breakfast and its easy of discovery from HKU MTR station B2.","December 13, 2018","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1222,"We wanted a larger hotel room with something of a harbour view in a more local area but handy for the MTR. Hotel Jen fulfilled all these criteria at a reasonable price and more than exceeded our expectations. The standout was the excellent standard of the housekeeping and the room's design features which made the most of the room size (quite large by HK standards though). The hotel's website photos are good indicators of what you get for your money and it also has good tips on things to do in the local area. Jen's location is fantastic if you want a more local feel; supermarkets of all kinds within a 2 minute walk, as was the MTR station entry with the ding-ding tram a block away (this is a very cheap way to get around the north of HK island). The on-site Malaysian restaurant was good and there is a rooftop pool and gym, a bar for Happy Hour (expensive otherwise) and a free shuttle bus (restricted times but very handy if you plan in advance). Any minor problem was quickly fixed by the staff who were super helpful.

We were originally booked into a club mountain view room but offered an upgrade to a club harbour view room for an extra 10 dollars a night which we decided to do. We were on the 27th floor and the view was amazing. The room was generously sized, spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. Being in a club room gave us certain benefits which included complimentary tea/coffee throughout the day, free canapés and drinks between 5.30 and 7.30 and an opportunity to have breakfast in the club lounge on the 28th floor instead of the restaurant and we would like to mention Sharon who was very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast buffet was absolutely fantastic, I have never had better. There was a fitness centre and rooftop pool but we did not have time to use them during our stay. We would also like to thank Guchi on reception who was so friendly in helping us navigate our way around Hong Kong on the underground. We would not hesitate in recommending this hotel.

1230,"Hotel Jen is superb. We stayed 6 nights in a Club Harbour View room (2604) and although you can't actually see Kowloon waterfront from there, it's still a pretty good view. It was well worth paying the extra for the Club room because you then had breakfast on the 28th floor in a relaxed quiet atmosphere (all you could want from a buffet, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, fruit juice, tea, coffee, cold meat, cheese and hard boiled eggs, plus scrambled eggs with usually beans, tomatoes or mushrooms). You also have access to free drinks (pretty well unlimited wine, beer, prosecco etc) plus sandwiches, sushi, other savoury nibbles all served in a quiet and efficient way by Billy and his colleagues.The pool is small and rarely had any sun when I was there but it is clean and not too cold, even in November.The in house restaurant was great for an early evening dinner before heading off on the Star Ferry for the night markets in KowloonThe location is amazing - just 1 minute to the nearest MTR station and buses/trams all within 5 minutes' walk too - the hotel website does not emphasise this enough! Shops, restaurants (try the Treasure Lake, authentically Cantonese, though not much of the menu is in English) and supermarkets all round the corner for convenience.Tip for the older generation - they do a discount by decade rate for the room so we got the third night and the sixth night for a fraction of the other four nights because of our age!","November 16, 2018","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1231,"Hotel Jen is located right beside an exit from the HKU MTR station, which means it’s a very quick and inexpensive trip to and from the airport. The staff are very friendly and the rooms are comfortable, with options for views. It is worth paying extra for 28th Level Club access, which means breakfast, and drinks with very substantial snacks in the evening. The neighbourhood is authentic, and offers lots of eating opportunities. Hotel staff recommended the Halite Massage service, just down the street, where I had a great massage. This was my 2nd stay there and I would happily go back.","November 14, 2018","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

It is about 30 minutes from the airport on the MTR, and a mere 5 minute ride from the Macau ferry port and the Central MTR station. The hotel has a nice lobby with a bar on the first floor and a restaurant on the second floor. There is a pool and a small gym on the roof and a club lounge on the 28th floor which offers breakfast, afternoon tea and evening food and drinks in addition to the all day offering with soft drinks, coffee and tea. No to mention the great harbour view from the lounge. There is good Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and as a Shangri-La elite members you will get a nice upgrade. The rooms are nice and a good size with Hong Kong measures and they have a nice windows ledge to sit and admire the Hong Kong view with either the harbour or the peak.

1235,Good mid range hotel in great location with access to the city via the MTR station just across the street. The MTR network is a cheap and efficient way to get around Hong Kong and costs just a few £’s. The rooms in the Jen are quite small but well laid out and have a great shower and separate toilet. There is a good TV and kettle for tea and coffee and the room was clean and housekeeping changed towels daily etc. Views are great from the the “Sea View” side but less so from the back but you can get the mega view of the city from other locations in Hong Kong. There is a small gym and a roof top pool but this area lost the sun in the afternoon but we did visit in November. Breakfast was a buffet with great variety but be careful as they struggled to keep up with demand (clear tables and stock up the buffet) after 8.30 when it got busy. The restaurant for dinner was standard fare but was quiet if you wanted a more reserved atmosphere compared with busier eateries down town. Reception staff were polite and helpful and there is a free shuttle service to key areas around town.,"November 6, 2018","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1238,"This is my first time in Hong Kong travelling with a friend in these parts. My friend had previously stayed at the Hotel Jen in Beijing and recommended we stay at this Hong Kong hotel. It’s in a great location, with many small shops, stores and eateries close by as well as a short walk to the metro station and airport buses. We had to cab it to the ferry terminal as it was a bit too far to walk - in the heat! Hotel Jen is a lovely, clean comfortable hotel with a rooftop pool that was quite nice and even had a lifeguard on duty. What a great view. Toiletries like toothpaste & toothbrushes were provided along with a superior brand of shampoos, body lotions, etc. Bedding was good quality and very comfortable. For a reasonable additional cost, we purchased the breakfast package which also included happy hour drinks and delicious snacks on the 28th floor with a great view of the harbour. In my view, the strength of this hotel is their exceptional staff - friendly, efficient, extremely accommodating, all which made this stay a wonderful experience. Everyone from the front desk staff, restaurant servers, shuttle/ taxi organizers, room cleaners, etc all did their part to make us feel welcomed and valued as a guest. I’ll definitely be back to stay at Hotel Jen in Hong Kong as soon as possible.","October 25, 2018","20    Hotel Jen Hong Kong by Shangri-La

1243,"This was the worst and the smallest room I have ever stayed in. When I booked the room, I chose the deluxe twin room, which was supposed to be 118 square feet. However, the room I got (#2) had only one bed and the room was approximately 7 ft. by 8 12 ft. The bathroom (shower, sink, and toilet, with no shower curtain) took up part of that space. It was just big enough for a bed and a small walkway to the side of and along the foot of the bed. Although it was advertised as a non-smoking hotel, the room smelled like cigarette smoke. I told Mike that the odor was terrible, and he sprayed the room. Unfortunately then it smelled like a combination of smoke and a chemical spray. The wallpaper was peeling in several places, and it was not applied properly. So overall, the room was tiny, smelly, and depressing. It was not deluxe in any way. Substandard would be a more accurate description. It was half the size of the room advertised, which I think is deplorable. That is false advertising! If I had known the true size of the room, I never would have stayed there, so I think that I should get at least half of my money back. It was in a good location, near the TST subway and the A21 airport bus, but that was the only positive thing about it. There was no lobby, just a small room from which you could access the 5 sleeping rooms,with a dispenser for hot and cold drinking water. Not a place to hang out if your room made you feel claustrophobic. So to call it a ""boutique"" hostel is quite an overstatement.","January 27, 2019","21    Sunrise International - Boutique Hostel

He was very helpful actually. He will send you everything you need.The building where the hostel is located is near Tsim Sha Tsui Station so going around is not a problem. The bus from the airport stops in front of the building which is actually great. One thing I like about this place is the lift. We never experienced waiting in line to go up and down. The room was super clean when we arrived, and we have a big window. Yes, there was a window. It didn't feel like staying in a den. The mattress was fine and same with the pillows. We just wished the blanket was big enough for 2. Other things we like about the place was their free water and their kettle. There was just one tiny issue we encountered. The room was tiny that we could not open our luggage unless we slip it under the bed. But it's HK. Space is limited.

1283,"Location, location, location....Subway next to hotel, buses going everywhere (airport too) by the hotel. Literally hundreds of restaurants and shopping galore just by stepping outside Nathan Road, the main street in Hong Kong and where the hotel is. You can walk anywhere from this hotel as it's in the middle of the town. Very clean, serviced daily...has shampoo and soap in bathroom. Yes, it's small, but all we needed was a clean room, the bed and our private bathroom. Have no complains. Mike was great....whatever you need to know, please ask him. The place is clean and safe (fire escape stairs across from elevator-we found them). No key to come in the room or the main area, just a code. There's also a guard downstairs. The rooms are on the 10th floor of an old building but never felt unsafe at all. Excellent free WiFi and AC. Yes, there are people on the street trying to get you to go to their stores but that happens around the world in big cities and has nothing to do with the hotel. Just ignore them and don't make eye contact. We stayed in Rm 2 and need to mention one thing: to reach the bathroom you need to step up about 12"" to get in. We were ok but need to let others know if they can't lift legs up too much. There's no bathtub and shower is next to the toilet but it has a good drain. We experienced no problems. The other thing is the TV only has Chinese channels, no English channels for those who want to watch TV.

1289,"First of all calling it “Boutique Hotel” is a bold exaggeration. It’s a closet with a bed and a toilet-shower. From now on I will be referring to the hotel as the closet.Let’s start with the good things.Mike, the owner, is a nice guy who is very helpful.It’s in a central location.It seems clean.Here’s what’s bad about the closet.It is the smallest thing you can imagine. Actually you can’t until you have seen it. It’s difficult to open a suitcase inside the closet!The beds are unbelievably uncomfortable. It’s a wood board with a thin and extra hard matrass. At home I sleep on a matrass on the floor so I like hard but this is like sleeping on your yoga mat. The closet should provide a free bottle of wine every day so that you can at least pass out for a couple of hours every night because real sleep is hard to come by here. At night there is a lot of light coming in from outside.The walls are paper thin. You can literally hear the neighbors farting.When you open the windows it reeks of kitchen. Keeping them closed makes the closet stuffy.Everything is so cheap. Starting with the TV with a viewing angle so bad you can’t see properly when you are lying in bed to the thing that should hold the shower head but comes crashing down.","January 6, 2016","21    Sunrise International - Boutique Hostel

1290,"This place is no boutique hotel, period. Even calling it a hotel is a misnomer. It is basically a collection of five guest rooms occupying a section of a floor in an old commercial building. It is also clearly a fire hazard as there is no fire escape plan for guests. Neighbouring units include a Korean language centre and a massage centre. I booked a so-called deluxe double room and got the shock of my life! Room 4 was so tiny that two persons will have to take turns to walk if they are not on the bed. And even one person will find it a struggle to take a shower in the cubicle of a bathroom without bumping into the sink and the toilet bowl! Naturally my wife and I checked out after only one night and were in fact quite happy to forfeit the other three nights that we had booked and paid for. It is unbelievable that this place is ranked so highly by TripAdvisor and we are of course thoroughly disappointed as our choice was based entirely on this ranking.

1291,Location is great. It's just beside Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station with McDonald's and KFC a few more steps away. Room is small but designed well so you actually feel its bigger than it really is. Bed was quite big and comfortable. Room is clean too. Bathroom is so small but you will get used to it. Btw careful with the hot water because it gets too hot it can be boiling you don't want to burn yourself. What I did was turn it on only a few minutes then turn it off when I'm about to use the water.Mike was nice and easy to talk to. No problems with him. There's no bathroom mat though so I always slip because a bit of water makes the floor slippery. I'd recommend to put bath mat outside the toilet door. Electric kettle could be put inside the room so you can use it whenever you want but i don't know where to put it since there's no more space. Overall great stay in Sunrise Hotel.

There is no view, it does have good air con and compared to pod hotels it's a mansion : ) Bathroom / shower was very good, had small hairdryer that was great and it was spotlessly clean. For size of room, bed was surprisingly large! It is located on the tenth floor of a 12 floor building on Nathan Road in the TST area - one of the two main roads in Kowloon, so you are literally on the door step of the shopping and the neon. Kowloon park is over the road, which is lovely and provides a bit of peace from the bustle. There is a metro next door and getting around is very easy with excellent public transport and very reasonable taxis. Mike, as other reviewers have said, is great, very helpful. There is both useful information in the hotel for restaurants and how to get to places and he is very prompt answering queries etc. Highly recommend if you want somewhere to sleep, that has what you need, is very good value for money and in the centre of Kowloon.","November 15, 2015","21    Sunrise International - Boutique Hostel

1298,"Nice Hotel, Staffs are very helpful, Clean rooms and common areas. I did online booking through Booking.com,The room was as mentioned online as suitable for Family of 3 members, but the room was not even suitable for a Single Traveler as there was no space for keeping a suitcase. We got our room upgraded from a Superior Room to Deluxe Room, which was far better with decent space for our suitcases and space for hanging our clothes. The Bed as mentioned was Queen Size but seems to be a bit lesser than a Queen size. The bathroom was spacious but no Towels hanging provision. There was no response when you call for Room Service, hence every time to order food one needs to go down to Reception to do so! The cafe restaurant was too small for morning breakfast, hence there was a wait time to get a free table everyday. Breakfast variety was less than standard hotels I have experienced during my 30+ years of International Travels. Since the Hotel is located along the Central Line of the MTR one could walk to the nearest Tai Wo Hau station. The Shuttle Bus system to and fro from Kwai Fong MTR station which is located next to Metro Plaza Mall was a Plus, only drawback was the last Shuttle bus from Kwai Fong MTR station is 22:15, which is a bit early for returning from any of your late evening activities.Dinner is a problem as there is no Buffet meal available.The next door 7 Eleven store is a great plus as one can get all your requirements from there at very economical price.There are no restaurants or eateries near the hotel at a walk-able distance.The overall experience was average!Not a value for money hotel!The Superior Rooms are not recommended for anyone!","June 25, 2019","22    Dorsett Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

It is complete utter chaos.The Dorsett is their basic room, but it is really small. And the bathroom is not very pleasant, moldy with an unpleasant smell. And the floor material is a mystery. Also I do not think the hotel respects the division of smoking and non smoking rooms. My friend was given a non smoking floor (16th) but her room smelled so bad she had to change it and she also overheard the reception staff telling another customer checking in that they could smoke in their room on the 16th floor. However I would like to thank Eric who helped me change my room.

1304,"My family stepped into Dorsett (Tsuen Wan) on 21st May'19 with lot of apprehension & ambiguity, as I took a chance by staying at a single city that too in a single hotel for 8 odd days of my tour to Hongkong. But your team at Tsuen Wan (Mr. Ricky NG, Rooms Division Manager in particular) proved my decision right in less than 3 hours with his communication and interpersonal skills. He has helped me with early checkin (1pm) and room upgradation (realized that 2 Delux rooms are small for us). Thank you very much Mr. Ricky and Team Dorsett Tsuen Wan for all the support.Plus points:Ample scenic view from windowsCleanliness and hygieneSupportive staffBreakfast, Shuttle services, Umbrellas.. etc.Things to focus:Compact room and bathroom (I assume this is obvious in a city like Hongkong)Missed Wardrobes big time.Access card deactivation issue and struggled with Wi-Fi","May 31, 2019","22    Dorsett Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

1312,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Dorsett Tsuen Wan on our last trip to Hong Kong, and cannot recommend the establishment highly enough. The facilities are thoroughly modern, and expertly maintained. We found our room to be large, comfortably adorned, and the hotel itself boasts excellent amenities. While not centrally located, the hotel is convenient to public transit, and is well positioned to commute into the city center, as well as visit the sites on Lantau Island. However what elevated the experience beyond a simple stay at a comfortable upscale hotel, was its staff. We would like to particularly commend Edwin, Karrie, and Zuji, who took a personal interest in us, made sure our stay was as pleasant and comfortable as possible, and took the time to offer us advice on how best to explore Hong Kong. It was their personal touch that made our stay so special and has made the Dorsett our favorite hotel in Hong Kong. We intend to make it our hotel of choice for future Hong Kong travel, thanks solely to their wonderful and dedicated staff.","May 2, 2019","22    Dorsett Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

The restaurant in the evening was not fabulous. The food was just ok and little variety. Vegetarian dish ordered and it was a plate of boiled broccoli. The family roared with laughter at how poor it was. The pool snacks very expensive. Shout out to Stefani in reception for the early check in and excellent service.

1317,"Spent a week in Hong Kong at the start of April, I usually stay Causeway Bay or Mong Kok (most of the time a few nights in each location) and my preferred hotel was the Dorsett at both locations (some times the sister hotel the Cosmo). So this time round I happened to book when the Hong Kong Sevens were on and the last two nights accomodation was sky high, so I decided to stay at the Dorsett Tsuen Wan as it was still reasonably priced.So the Dorsett was just like its other locations, the room was small, but has everything you need, it was clean and comfortable, the view from my room was not great (looked like an abandoned building, but also had a view of the pool (which was very refreshing) the hotel itself was great, but it’s location was the issue. If you are familiar with Hong Kong it’s not a massive problem as transport is amazing, but I am guessing a new tourist in HK may have some difficulties.There are two near by MTR stations I couldn’t tell you which was closer, but the easiest one to get (Tai wo hau) to was straight down a motorway about 5 minutes walk (very easy to find) the other Kwai Wing was most likely closer, but you have to pretty much climb up a mountain then scale down it to get there. Kwai Wing is also where the closest shops and restaurants were. And that was the major issue.I imagine if you were having a family holiday this would be a great place to stay, but if you want to be in the centre of the action I would recommend the Dorsett Kowloon or Wen Chai.","April 16, 2019","22    Dorsett Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

1318,"The hotel is easy to find, just one bus ride from the airport and a minute of walking. It's not too far away from the MRT, about 10-minute walk. I am very happy with the concierge, their people are so nice and good, easy to talk to and helpful. The check-in is good as well as it is 24 hours. I just expected them to be a bit nicer or more accommodating. I sent an e-mail before the check-in (some inquiries about check-in and booking) and no one got back to me and as we were checking in separately at different times I wanted to request a bigger bed for my parents instead of two single bed and I just got the answer that it's not what I reserved, I hope they were nicer about it. In terms of the room, it is okay, it is spacious and the bed is good especially the pillow. What I didn't like is that the room is dusty. I'm guessing they just change the sheets and not really vacuum the place or sweep it. Stayed for a week and during the last day, I was surprised they didn't refill/ gave me tea in my room. Another thing they have is the buffet breakfast, the selection is not that bad, average. We had some experience there though, we were already in the cafe, we went in the right entrance and they checked our room in the list and before we could get some food, someone asked us to leave and reenter again, and I just told him that we went in from the entrance and we even have our table already. Interesting stay... Overall, the hotel was okay, again thumbs up to the concierge and hopefully, the rooms would be cleaned more thoroughly (at least removing the dust).","April 14, 2019","22    Dorsett Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

1323,"This hotel is comfortable and in a very convenient central location next to the race course. The amenities are good, with an in room safe and coffee making facilities. The room was very clean. Breakfast was adequate, but you had to hang onto plates and cutlery that you might want to use. The staff are over enthusiastic about clearing tables and getting guests moving. We had one problem while staying at the hotel. We had a connecting room, th3dor which was of course locked. We were woken at 1.30 am by a party being held in the next room. At 3.30 am, I called reception to complain. They did nothing. I telephone again at 4.30am and was told that we could move to another room. While were were not causing the problem, we had to be the ones who sorted it. I told them to get on and just sort the problem. We were basically told it was our fault for not refusing a connecting room.Because of our experience, I could not recommend staying here.

1325,"This is the second time (for 7 nights) I have stayed at the Dorsett Tsuen Wan when the first time was in November 2018 (for 10 nights).The prices for Dorsett Tsuen Wan is very reasonable for Hong Kong hotel prices although the hotel is away from the tourist attractions but then HK is really a small place. The hotel is not actually located in Tsuen Wan but in Kwai Chung and the nearest MTR station is at Tai Wo Hau which is a 7 mins walk along the main road (Castle Peak Road) from the hotel. To get to Tai Wo Hau MTR you will need to cross a footbridge but elevators are available at both ends of the footbridge for those with steps climbing difficulties.There is a direct airport bus A32 ($18.90) from airport to hotel and the stop is directly outside the hotel. The journey takes approximately 45mins and the stop is the penultimate stop on the route, listen out for bus stop announcement under the hotel name. On the way back to the airport you will need to drag your cases up to the top of the hill for the bus stop back to the airport or alternatively go down the hill from the hotel and round the corner there is a bus stop for bus E32 ($10.80) back to the airport, journey time is slightly longer than the more direct A32 bus.The hotel does supply free shuttles sharing with Silka Tsuen Wan hotel to Kwai Fong MTR, Tsing Yi and Tsim Sha Tsui. The bus holds approximately 30 passengers so it is best to reserve your place at the front desk. Coming back to the hotel operates a first come first serve service. Shuttle bus timetable is available online on the hotel website.From hotel to Mong Kok you will be looking at journey time of 30mins and Tsim Sha Tsui 35-40mins and Central 45mins.There is a small 7-11 directly adjacent to the hotel that shuts at 11pm (they do open longer when there are customers). Go up to the top of the hill and turn left there is a HK style Cha Chaan Teng (Windsor) and other small eateries. Or at the top of the hill and turning right, there is a small shopping mall (Kwai Chung Shopping Centre). In the shopping centre there is a Cafe de Coral and Wellcome supermarket amongst other shops.On to the hotel, both of my visits I had a superior room but I have to say I much prefer the layout on my latest room on the 20th floor. You can have either 2 single beds or combine them to a double/king bed. The amenities in the room include a large wall mounted flat screen TV, mini fridge, kettle, tea/coffee, safe and a walk-in shower. You will also receive complimentary 2 bottles of water daily , free use of a smartphone for phone calls and internet and free in-room WiFi. The WiFi speed was brilliant on my previous stay in November 2018 but on this visit it was a tad slower at times with buffering video however it is still very usable.Laundry service is available by the pound with minimum of 5lbs at $73 then an increment of $7/lb. Per item laundry, dry cleaning and pressing is also available.On the ground floor of the hotel, there is a small restaurant. Above this is a gym and an outdoor swimming pool.This hotel attracts a lot of mainland China tour groups. So expect masses of people at check-ins and in lobby late in the evening and some indiscipline behaviour.Overall the staff from front desk to house keeping to shuttle drivers are very good. The quality of hotel and facilities are good. The cleanliness of the room and bathroom although good but could be better such as do some dusting. The location of the hotel although not brilliant but is still very manageable to get to places. If you don’t want to wait for the shuttle bus, you can just walk 7mins to Tai Wo Hau MTR station then HK is accessible at your fingertip. The real gem of this hotel is the price. For the price that you pay and the quality that you receive, it is way better than the extortionate prices of centre of town hotels in Hong Kong with less quality.Although there is a slight disappointment at check-in but in no way affected my stay and it was a great room that I had. Having now stayed a combined 17 nights at this hotel where many guests would normally stay for limited nights. The hotel did not recognised myself as a returning guest but instead offered me at a cost upgrade from a bed of 1.5m to 1.8m at check-in. Now how much would it cost to them to offer a returning guest a free upgrade? The room I booked and paid for was more than adequate anyway. If the price is still right, I will definitely return to this hotel again.","April 9, 2019","22    Dorsett Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

Room space is acceptable for 1 person, amenities are sufficient, main problem was that, the soundproofing part is fail, TV sound, talking easily heard from next door, called twice to reception, sorry, no one answer. After the stay, my boss told me that some other hotel may closer to our company, like the Panda hotel.","March 21, 2019","22    Dorsett Tsuen Wan, Hong Kong

1355,"The Pentahotel has a cool aesthetic, a game room, billiard area, a restaurant and a pizza place. The rooms are not large but comfortably proportioned in a city where space is at a premium. The bed was king sized (important as my husband is very tall) and comfortable. There was a window seat for reading or just staring at the surrounding buildings. The bathroom was clean and the shower had both a handheld spray and a rainhead shower with excellent water pressure. The nearest MTR (metro) station was only a 5-7 minute walk.The hotel receives a number of groups but was well set up for it. Groups have a separate check-in so you won't have to wait behind 50 people to check in or ask a question. There are also numerous, spacious elevators so even when 50 people all try to get to their rooms at once with luggage, you won't have to wait more than 3 to 4 minutes for an elevator.Cons: The hotel is about 40 minutes from Central (main business district) so, if that's where you plan to do a lot of site seeing, you should bear it in mind. Disney, as well as the airport are about an hour (the airport is where you catch the bus to Macau) so, again, if that's your plan and you are cramped on time, it is a consideration. I found the lighting in hotel bathroom quite dark when I was trying to put on make-up (we also encountered numerous dark bathrooms at restaurants on this trip so maybe it's a thing in HK). It was only a problem for putting on make-up but there is a big mirror on the bathroom door (facing the room) so you could use that with out issues.The hotel is on a street with some warehouses and between that and the tour groups, I worried about noise (bad past experience in France and Thailand) but the rooms were very well insulated. I only heard noise in the hall once - otherwise, nothing. I didn't hear the delivery trucks, the neighbors, nothing. Overall, the hotel is very nice and very well priced for Hong Kong.","May 22, 2019","23    Pentahotel Hong Kong, Kowloon

I swear this hotel is amazing... it definitely gave me New York City vibes. Everything was perfectly odd but it mesh brilliantly. Let me not forget to mention the bathroom and showerhead is literally to die for. Also this hotel is so tech-savvy and each room includes a PS4. On to the staff they were so caring and professional, from the time the taxi picked us up until the taxi took us back to the airport.

We ate out most nights, but a few our group had pizza / others ate dinner and complimented the offerings they tried. The room(s) were perfect & the staff great (PROVIDED you talk to the right one). All seemed young, eager to help, but some are not strong in English ... get the right staff person and your question, concern, or problem is addressed properly. This was our first experience with Pentahotel(s) and strongly suggest you consider them in your travel plans. We will be using them again for sure.

If you are done with the usual tourist spots visits and wish to explore HK suburbs, this is definitely a good hotel option.","March 20, 2019","23    Pentahotel Hong Kong, Kowloon

1383,"Definitely one of our best stay in Hong Kong! The room was wonderful, modern, spacious and comfortable! There was still space to walk after I opened my luggage. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood with a shopping mall Plaza Hollywood about 8 mins walk away. There's a direct bus from the bus interchange (next to the mall entrance) to Sai Kung for a relaxing day trip. You can also go for the guided tour provided by the Hong Kong Volcano Discovery Centre on weekends but recommended to book in advance on their website first as it's quite popular. Convenient to take bus A29 from the airport to Diamond Hill Station. It's about 10 mins walk to the hotel from there.","March 20, 2019","23    Pentahotel Hong Kong, Kowloon

1384,"The second major meeting for me in February after the India visit was at Hong Kong. This time, we had been looking for a hotel close to the office and the best we got was Penta Hotel in Kowloon. There seem to be two in Hong Kong and hence, it makes sense to get the address (in Chinese also if possible) to show to the taxi driver. Made it in 35 minutes from the airport. Access to the hotel is via one of the lanes and unless you happen to be looking for it, it is easy to miss as the name plate is also not very large. But my driver had no issues finding it. There is a pizza bar at the entrance and a seating area, but the actual check in is on the first floor. You could go via the elevator or there is a set of escalators going 2 levels up past mezzanine to the check in lobby. Check in was quick and efficient though we had quite a few people. It could be because group check-ins (of which there were many in the days I was there) are handled elsewhere which reduces the crowd on the 1st floor lobby. Got a room on the 22nd floor and the view was pretty much the buildings around…nothing great. The room itself was quite small and minimalist compared to other cities, but was large for local standards. The bed occupied much of the space with a small area for storage without a wardrobe or cupboard again. (Ended up leaving my soiled clothes out in the open.). There is a small work area adjoining it and a mini-refrigerator. The bathroom was a small affair as well ( in stark contrast to my last stay just a week ago)., but equipped with the common toiletries and amenities. In short, minimalist and everything worked. Only things I missed was a set of drawers or wardrobe, an iron with board and given the climate, a spare umbrella. Am told the last two could have been requested from reception though I did not try. Though they had 25 rooms or so per floor, it did not seem overly congested and there was no noise creep from adjoining rooms. The window area also had a seating cushion if you wished to sit by the window. It helped for times when had my colleagues gather in the room for a meeting and not all of us could be accommodated on the bed or the one chair. The most impressive feature of the check-in was a short card they gave which had a map of everything one would need in the vicinity of the hotel including convenience stores, medical, supermarket, transport, etc. For any first time visitors to Kowloon, this was immensely helpful and a very nice touch. I must also mention that the metro station is a short 8 minute walk away. We had opportunity to use the bar on the first floor and also the restaurant for breakfast. At breakfast which started only by 7 am, there were no manual lists and they would just swipe your room card to let you in. While I was impressed on day 1 with the choices, by day 3 it became a little repetitive as there was absolutely no change in the dishes. A lot of the food was Asian style including samosas from India, Congee, local style noodles, fruits, bread, etc. Table service was minimal and you sat where you found an empty table and served yourself. The bar service was a lot better in the evenings when we had dinner and drinks with a good selection of burgers and other convenience food. The area around the lobby also had some entertainment areas for playing games including two pool tables which were in use most of the times I tried. They also had a small reading area which was a hit with the kids spending a lot of time there. One of my colleagues tried the pizza bar and was all praise for the quality of the food. Checkout was quick and efficient again despite a small queue. The staff ability to converse in English was definitely helpful. There is a queue outside for getting a taxi and though we in one of the smaller lanes, they could call for a taxi whereby waiting time was not that bad. The space in front of the entrance was also big enough for the larger buses with the tour groups to come in and park.  ","March 18, 2019","23    Pentahotel Hong Kong, Kowloon

My room also had coffee pot, small fridge and a safe. It’s location away from the hustle of Kowloon kept it nice and quiet. It’s also within walking distance to subway and busses. So much so that I pulled my suitcase to the bus station at Rhythm Garden and took the bus A22 to the airport for $39 HK which is about $5. The hotel also has a airport shuttle for more $ but it was so easy to ride the bus. The nearest subway station is Diamond Hill with a gigantic shopping center with a supermarket on top floor. The wifi at the hotel was great too. In short, I’d recommend this hotel!","March 8, 2019","23    Pentahotel Hong Kong, Kowloon

The breakfast buffet has plenty of variety for everyone. The downside is the location. It is not even on the tourist map. They do have a shuttle that takes you to the heart of Kowloon that runs on the hour, however the last one back is 7:30 pm. The subway is about 4 blocks away but the area is not the most comfortable to walk around. This is an abandoned industrial area with massive construction as of this writing.

I returned to find there was still a piece of tissue found between the sofa and the bedside table of my room (1104). The floor was also not well vacuumed, still had bread crumbs from my previous night’s in-room dining.2) the handles on wardrobe and fridge door are loose, need to be gentle with it.I hope to see improvements when I do return in future.","April 22, 2019","24    Park Hotel Hong Kong

1458,"I have stayed here on and off for the past year as I have been working in HK but on an accommodation budget.Since I basically live in HK - I wanted to be somewhere a bit quieter, but still with good public transport. I much prefer Ovolo southside's location on the south side of HK versus Central or the north of the island. And the MTR is a 3 minute walk which is perfect.Over the months the nightly rate for mini queen / twin has been around 700 HKD (usually by booking through one of the online travel sites). That is a fantastic deal for an on-island hotel with MTR connectivity. A cab at night can take as little as 10-15 minutes from central.Would note that booking direct with ovolo / marriott is usually more expensive, although the latter gives you breakfast and happy hour every day. The mini queen room is perfect for a solo traveller - might be a bit small for 2 people.Nice touches include free minibar, welcome bag of treats, and free self laundry. The apple tvs and large TV screens in every room are great.Big floor to ceiling windows provide sweeping views. Electric blackout blinds keep out all light, although occasionally the blinds get jammed in the mechanism. A/C is perfect. Everything feels new, and i like the style of the exposed ceilings with the pipework visible. the hotel is hip and has a 80s music vibe. Customer service is very good and everyone speaks english well. It feels like staying in a western hotel - which is a very high complement. From my experience in Asia -- even the swankier and pricier hotels sometimes lack that western, friendly customer engagement. i always ask to stay on the ocean park side as it is a great view and there is no road noise (motorway runs behind the hotel). When i stayed on the motorway side i did on occasion find the traffic a bit noisy.Be warned - there isnt much of a bar scene (the hotel's own rooftop bar is great though) and there are a few eateries nearby, but i tend to go out in central anyway.","July 11, 2019","25    Ovolo Southside

The rooms are very modern and clean with all the amenities you could need. The room was equipped with a TV with many channels, as well as an Apple TV. WiFi is very fast and abundant throughout the hotel. Thankfully you only need to login once at the beginning of your stay. The free minibar is a nice touch. There is a free happy hour in the lounge everyday from 5pm - 7pm with free flow drinks and snacks. The lounge is the perfect place to work with your laptop. And if you want to take a break there is a pool table you can use for free as well. The fitness center is sizable with all of the equipment one would need. The food at the restaurant (Komune) was terrific, with a good blend of modern and comfort food. The rooftop bar (Above) has a panoramic view of the neighborhood.But the best part of this hotel are the staff.

We loved the full floor-to-ceiling glass window view to Ocean Park, the comfy sofa, the bar, the make-up room ( which my fiancé loved so much), and very nice minibar that got refilled everyday. As I have informed Joe during the booking process this would be our pre-wedding trip, although I was only expecting a small surprise from them, we were amazed by how he had the room ready so nicely decorated and the welcoming note from the hotel management and staff to surprise my fiancé. It was just incredibly well-prepared. I really appreciate the effort and wowed by the impression they made. Then we had a chat during happy hour with Joe, I just randomly mentioned about the fact that there was only 1 trash bin in the bathroom, and then once again, the staff went an extra mile to follow up (although it wasn’t really a request from us), as we got back to the room after happy hour, we found an extra trash bin in the living room area, which showed how thoughtful the staffs were, as they really do listen to their guests. We also got helped from Brian (the night security) as he called a taxi for us to the airport at the very last minute and we only have to wait about 10 minutes( we couldn’t get Uber in the early morning - about 5am, which we thought we could the night before, so we didn’t request booking the taxi ahead of time). Overall, there is no word that can express how we loved our stay at Ovolo Southside. We would definitely not only recommend Ovolo Southside to our friends and families, but also come back here again when we visit HongKong. P.s: I’d like to thank the hotel management and staffs (especially Joe ) here for a wonderful stay ever!","June 22, 2019","25    Ovolo Southside

1467,"Lots of thoughts about my stay here. First of all it is much closer to the main centre than it looks on the map, it was only 14 min by bus at night and 2 stops by the metro to Hong Kong Island Central. Staff were very friendly and helpful and took delivery of some items I had ordered before I even arrived at the hotel. There is a lounge/restaurant/bar/chilling area with free tea/coffee and biscuits. You can order food from here or go upstairs to the main restaurant and terrace the food is good but the menu limited and on the expensive side. My room - Mini Queen - was on one of the lower floors to rear of the hotel on the roadside so i did not get the views overlooking the park and football pitches in the photos. My main issue was not only was there noise from the road but also a large generator/air con unit to the side of the building by the room, although it didn't keep my up if your a light sleeping the combination of both may affect your night, i called reception willing to pay for an upgraded room (Deluxe Queen) however they were fully booked at the time. The room apart from that was good with a comfy bed and strangely large shower that faced the road with frosted glass. the rest of the room had electronic blinds that did a good job of covering the floor to ceiling windows and blocking nearly all the light in at night. The items in the fridge are freebies and also you get a goody bag with a couple small snacks which is great. One excellent facility was the free self-service laundry room which allowed me to wash and dry all my clothes and bring the back nice and clean :) there is also a fitness room. If you're up for abit of a walk you can take the back route from the hotel along the river and up to Victoria Peak, it takes just under 3hrs or ones stop to Ocean Park. Overall a good stay but next time i'll get a deluxe room.","June 22, 2019","25    Ovolo Southside

Location is perfect - quiet and well-connected. The design of the hotel is chic urban living art and casual fine dining. The special part is the co-working and community space, which encourages great networking possibilities.

1474,"We had a poor start to our stay at the Ovolo Southside, with an indifferent—practically cold—reception. No smile or welcome of any kind, which seemed strange, especially after having received very warm welcomes in mainland China. We were then checked into a mini twin room. Our mistake for booking it. Noise from the busy four lane road below was totally unacceptable. After returning from dinner late that night, we asked the front desk for a room switch. The night manager accommodated us immediately, putting us in a high floor room with a double bed. A much better arrangement for us, roomier and quiet. The rest of our stay was really good. Breakfasts were terrific, the one happy hour in which we partook was nice (good wine, beer and snacks). Self service laundry was a great feature. Tea, coffee all day long.The location? Super handy to the MTR (you’re in Admiralty within minutes) and some cutting edge contemporary art galleries are just steps away. The neighbourhood is transforming. And don’t forget the beaches (ie: the lovely Deep Water Bay) that are close by too…have a swim in the morning!We will return. ","June 9, 2019","25    Ovolo Southside

Tried to get it back, buthad no chance (who would hand in an empty tote-bag...). Got in touch with hotel and told them the story about the lost bag. 10 minutes later I received a message from the GM that they would be happy to post a replacement bag (for free...on top of everything else). I wasn't expecting any reply at all, let alone the message that Ovolo would send me another bag (more than one year after my last stay there).

The rooftop bar is a great spot in the evening where I invited local friends over who loved it. The Komune restaurant was even better than previously.

Everything in the mini bar is free and refilled daily. The toilet is small but adequate and the water pressure is superb.There is a 24 hours gym and also free flow of beers from 5 to 7 pm at the lobby. The breakfast however is a letdown. Minimal choice and exactly the same everyday. Image staying for 4 nights.The nearest MTR is Wong Chuk Hang which is the green line about 5 mins walk.

I was at 6F level on the main road (i rhink itscalled Wang Chuk Hang road ..), and louder noise of cars passing by on the road was coming all day and night.

1489,"If you are looking for a place to stay on Hong Kong island add this hotel to your list. I didn't find it right away as I wasn't looking for hotels on the South Side of the island - but I should have been! First off the location is amazing. Right next to the MTR meaning moments away from Central and Causeway Bay. It is also right next to the Aberdeen tunnel so is a 5 min bus/cab ride will have you near all the action.That said it is a much nicer place for the price than you would find elsewhere. The free mini bar is great as there is always a chilled bottle of water (or beer :) waiting for you after a long flight.If you book through the hotel you still get Marriott points which is an amazing value at the price point. Simply quote your Marriott number at check-in.Also special shot out to Joe who I often see at check-in. He leads by example and always puts the guests firsts.

They've remodeled a little and changed the restaurant to Kommune HK.Overall, the service was excellent led by their manager, Sonesh. I'd stay here again on my next trip to HK.PRO TIP: This property is near Ocean Park, on a previous stay, I just actually walked going there. It's also near an MTR station as well.The only ""downside"" I could see was that it's in the south island area of HK, which means it's fairly far from the main action in the central island. I would typically do all my activities that I wanted before coming back to the property - mostly because once I'm back I'd get lazy to go out again even though it's probably just a 20-30 min train ride from the action. On the upside, the area is rather quiet and more relaxed than most areas in the city - which is a huge relief after either a day of touring and shopping or business engagements.","May 15, 2019","25    Ovolo Southside

1493,"My teenage daughter and I stayed at the Ovolo Southside for 7 nights. The hotel is located away from the main tourist hotspots, in an industrial area, so you get to see a side of Hong Kong that most visitors might not. That said, the fantastic MTR makes it easy to get to most places you might want to visit during your stay.Typically, we stay at boutique hotels with just a few rooms, so I was a little apprehensive about staying in a hotel that had over 150 rooms. However, except for one Saturday morning when the breakfast room was packed to capacity, the hotel still retained the feel of a small and personalized one. The staff are all friendly and go out of their way to help with any requests you may have. During our stay, Andy was usually on breakfast duty. He greeted us with a cheerful smile every morning and was always on hand if I needed help with the Nespresso coffee maker. Tomas and Quinton ensured the check in/check out was easy and effortless. The housekeeping lady on our floor (11th) was also very sweet! We stayed in a Mini Queen room. The room is adequate for two people. Our room overlooked the Wong Chuk Hang road, and surprisingly we could hear traffic whooshing past on the road 11 floors below. No review of Ovolo is complete without mentioning the freebies! We loved the bath amenities, the loot bag, and the free mini bar. We also used the free self-laundry facility. It drizzled pretty much most days while we were there, and we used the umbrellas the hotel provided.

1513,"I stayed here with my father last yr. I have had an excellent experience. My father also liked it. He was 86 yrs old and since have expired. I have my last pleasant memories of my father associated with this place. We stayed for 4 nights and day. We arrived by the free shuttle bus from the central station after taking the airport Express train. That bus serves 4 other local hotels too, and selecting the bus might cause a bit confusion. Talk to the driver because sometimes eventhough it's written that it will come to this hotel, but it may go to another hotel. For regular travels, walking 10 mins to the central station was our choice. Somedays we have taken the tram , which used to stop almost Opposite to the entrance of the hotel. The ground floor has some shops including a Starbucks where we had some snacks. Very convenient. 7/11 was next door. Lots of restaurants all around. We used to try a different one every time. I booked the room with A free breakfast option. A superb widespread menu of buffet with good seating options was available. My father really enjoyed it and ate a lot. The menu consisted of continental and asian items. Getting a room was very fast. I am an Accor member. So I had a separate counter for fast registering and check out. Very convenient. I would advise everybody to take the accor membership. Got me a lovely deal and also a harbour facing room. Lots of elevators available but sometimes there is a bit queue. I have had prior experiencees with long queues in hongkong few times so took it in my stride. The room was small but not the smallest I have stayed in HKG. The view window was truly magnificent. Huge wall window. The early morning sunrise gave a huge positive vibe. Bathroom was neat and small but all basic amenities were available. Cleaned daily. Beds were cleaned too. Beds were very comfortable and soft. Pillows were okay. Overall, I was very satisfied. Value for money. My suitcase got stuck , and they sent a mechanic very soon, but he couldn't open it. So we broke the lock. But he was very helpful and well behaved. ","July 8, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

1514,"Was here for 2 week stay and had booked a city view room, however due to length of stay and being an Accor member I was upgraded to a side harbour view room.Reception can be found on the 5th, plenty signage and 3 lifts to get you there. Pleasant friendly welcome by the reception team, quickly checked in and on way to room, there’s another 2 lifts going from 5th floor to rooms, so 5 in total. During the stay never really had to wait for a lift at all. Room was on the 20th floor out of 32 so gave good view over part of harbour, essentially facing the ICC building. Room was a good size for Hong Kong, probably more so as I was by myself. Room amenities included TV (international channels), fridge, tea/coffee facilities, free WiFi, air conditioning. Decent size bathroom with shower, one thing I enjoyed was the shower as it was quite powerful, with hot water available anytime day/night within a minute of turning on. Air conditioning was a god send after being out all day to come back to a cool room.Food/drink wise, hotel did have a restaurant on the 6th floor with bar on 5th. Only had breakfast here on one morning, which I found to be good, with cereals, yoghurts, cheese, breads, fruit, cooked food, was a good mix of traditional western and local foods. To get to hotel there’s 3 options from the airport. Easiest/most expensive option is airport express train then free shuttle bus which drops you outside, this also covers 4 other hotels in area. Then you can catch the airport flyer bus from the airport to bus terminal with a 10/15 minute walk. Cheapest option but not the easiest is a local bus from airport to Tung Chung, then the MTR to central to change onto island line then a 10 minute walk from MTR station.Nearby.Beneath the hotel is a Starbucks and Italian restaurant, there’s a 7-11 around the corner and also a U-select supermarket which sells Tesco branded goods. Within 2/3 mile there is 2 shopping malls, which have a variety of eateries, including a M & S Foodhall.","July 4, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

We didn’t eat in the hotel as there were too many options outside! The location was good, but google maps were hard to follow the tiny and convoluted streets. Just get lost and then ask google to take you home! The effort to get to and from the airport to the hotel was relatively easy. Train to the central station and a shuttle that runs every 10 minutes and drops you at the door!

1517,"This Ibis is located in the Sheung Wan area of Hong Kong, which is the next stop from Central on the MTR. It is surrounded by shops and restaurants and is a 5 to 10-minute walk from the MTR station. The hotel incorporates a Starbucks Coffee shop on the ground floor. Next door is a good restaurant, mostly western food, which is a good place to settle for a final drink before bed. The Ibis is a 3-star hotel and is good value for that rating. The lifts are a little confusing as not all go down to ground floor, but you soon figure it out. They are fast and you never wait more than 2 to 3 minutes for one. Reception staff are polite and helpful. Breakfast was varied and I am sure had enough choice to satisfy Eastern and Western palates. I paid for a harbour view room and would do so again on a return. The view was magnificent and was indeed the focal point of the room. As such, drawing the curtains at night was the last act before retiring. The room is as it looks on the hotel's own website. They are a little small, though average by Hong Kong standards and have all amenities you would expect. In summary, when looking for a hotel in HK, the harbour view was the most important to me. After that came location and price. All the 4 to 5 star hotels which offered harbour view rooms were extremely expensive by comparison. I opted for a reasonable 3 star standard but with a 5 star view, which was much more affordable.","June 20, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

However, the management has evidently lost all sense of standards and quality, and apparently never actually manages the property or staff.The front office staff are absolutely incompetent, poorly trained and wilfully ignorant. They struggle with rudimentary English (and there are no Korean or Japanese speakers, despite the number of guests from those nations). On check-in I had to make a request four times and then ask twice why she was not acknowledging or responding to my questions. On check-out I was promised a consolidated invoice, which I never received and, apparently, cannot be done.* By the service standards, cleanliness and need of routine maintenance, management appears never to be checking or reviewing anything.

A mini fridge and a safe. The bathroom was clean and the shower pressure perfect . The hotel is a 15 minute walk to Central but trams are just outside a good cheap way to travel. We would definitely stay again. The staff were very helpful we had to check out at 12 but our flight wasn’t until nearly midnight so the staff let us leave our luggage in storage . The pictures are the view from our room.,"May 6, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

1534,"We mostly stay in Ibis Hotels. You can depend on what is on offer. This hotel is easily reached via the A11 airport bus that stops at the Macau ferry terminal, a 5 minute walk (even with luggage) to the hotel. It is also well situated to get to ferries, busses, the Metro and trams. It is well worth getting a harbour view room as the view is worth it.The staff were always friendly and helpful, from our early arrival (luggage were stowed) to our departure (taxi organized). Apart from multiple restaurants in the area there is also a very ""local"" food court style eatery if you turn to the left out of the front door of the hotel and left at the first junction, then up an escalator where we had an interesting and affordable meal.The breakfast is the normal, busy affair with a good spread of eastern and western food available. We did not see any venue in the vicinity that that provided an easier or more affordable alternative to their breakfast offering.I would certainly consider staying at this hotel again when I return to Hong Kong.","May 4, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

1537,"Arrived in Hong Kong very early fromour flight from Sydney. The hotel was very easy to get to catching the airport train and the the free shuttle H2 from Hong Kong station (Ibis is the 3rd stop). We knew that it was unlikely that our rooms would be ready until 2ish so was happy to leave our luggage. At the time of arrival we were told I that one of the rooms a studio would be ready earlier but decided to just come back after 2pm.When we arrived back after a very long day of shopping at around 5.30pm. When we went to check in we were told that the studio wouldn’t be ready until after 7pm (despite being told that it would be ready before 2.00pm early. As my Mother in law was exhausted and this was her room, this was just not good enough. Finally they managed to sort the rooms out and gave as a complimentary drink as we are Accor members.This did set us off on the wrong foot slightly!The rooms are exactly what you pay for, very basic. The studio room is worth the extra investment as it gives you that bit of extra room. There is absolutely no amenities, we didn’t have any shampoo even which was a little surprising not sure if this was an oversight or not.Location is ok, there was so good restaurants in the area and the tram leaves straight out the front which is handy.Given the number of hotels in Hong Kong don’t think I would go back to the Ibis.","April 23, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

You could not hear any noise from any other rooms. Free bottles of water provided every day. The hotel is located extremely close to a tram stop and approx 10 mins Sheung Wan MRT Station.

I had done a recon on one of my previous trips.Well, I was very happy. Great staff from check In & I had the privilege of meeting the FOM Jennifer. Several check in/out desks & always quick service at Premium one. Also good number of lifts to add to the efficiency of the hotel.Excellent room over looking the Macau Ferry Terminal. Close to MTRs, Trams & A etc buses, & of course the Ferry Terminal. Nice food & drinks in the hotel, where we had a meal of two & my partner organised a birthday slice.Rooms were a good size, comfortable & cool. The floor was quiet & next visit I would love to book a themed room, like the one next door.Great cafes & shopping nearby & all the facilities necessary made for an excellent stay.Being CBD west-side, transport to & from HKIA was that little bit shorter. Plus Hong Kong Airport Express Train is easily connected to by the complimentary shuttle. Great late checkout very much appreciated.Thanks again to all the team. Excellent stay.

Breakfast also quite basic.The bad thing happened on the last day of my stay. I left my travel wallet outside the safe with €100 in €20 bills that disappeared. I did not check the wallet prior to leaving the hotel, maybe because it never happened to me before. Nevertheless the money was there, unspent,and I was counting on it at arrival in my country for immediate expenses. After leaving the hotel the wallet was always on me; the only way the money could have gone was me being mugged. Contacted the hotel management by email, they were courteous, looked into the cctv tapes, saw nothing out of the ordinary.

1549,"Arriving in Hong Kong for the first time since 2010 I had forgotten just how big the airport was although it easy enough to follow the signs. I took the Airport Express to Hong Kong Station, end of the line, and transferred to a free Shuttle H2 to the Ibis Sheung Wan Central, the shuttle drop off and pick up point is at the side entrance of the hotel, take the lift to lobby on the 5th floor. The free shuttle is part of your ticket for the express train but nobody on the bus seems to check for a ticket.The reception area is smart and clean with an adjoining dining area; the staff on duty spoke good English and in no time I was checked in and on my way to the room. The room was large and spotlessly clean with twin beds, small fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, fast free WIFI, and good sized shower and toilet. The location is good being 100 metres from one of the main arteries and tram lines with Hong Kong’s retro streetcars.I had to skip the included breakfast as you need a good deal of time to go through the processing for the HI Speed Rail service to Beijing which leaves West Kowloon (on the mainland) at 8:05am. But from what I gathered it consists of a self serve buffet. From past experience with Ibis hotels their breakfasts are good value and set you up for the day. This hotel came as part of a package my travel agent sent up (I usually book my own accommodation), although I did suggest an Ibis, I find they represent good value for money and usually are fairly close to the action, although not always. This Ibis did not disappoint. A couple of tips if you need a 24hr shop or cash machine, just outside the hotel’s main entrance , turn left into the side street and there is a 7-Eleven right in front of you on the opposite of the road. The HBSC bank is right in front you on the main street, two cash points on the main road side.On the Sunday I was about to catch the first shuttle at 06:20 but it was cancelled at 06:30 we were told by one of the other people waiting, she had phone the shuttle operators. Taxis were passing by the dozen so as I needed to get to the High Speed Train fast I hailed a cab and it took me direct to West Kowloon HST station. It worked out at AUD21, not bad, and that included the tunnel toll.","March 24, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

1551,"I am very torn. Pro's:The staff were amazingly friendly and attentive. We asked for extra pillows and they arrived in minutes. We asked for an iron and it arrived almost immediately. I left my camera in the lobby area when departing and the staff were of great assistance in getting it couriered to me. They gave us good advise on getting around the city.The breakfast was very enjoyable with lots of choice.The view from our harbourview room on the 32nd floor was spectacular.The shuttle bus service from/to the Airport Express was most welcome. Cons:I know this is Hong Kong and we have little experience of travel in Asia, but for what we paid, we found the room very small. But the bigger issue was that the room was damp. The large window was always running with condensation and we wiped it with one of the towels when we wanted a clear view. As a result, our clothes were damp. In fact, the contents of our suitcases were damp when we got home.There was a large dust ball that appeared from under the bed.The bottom of the door frame in the bathroom had moisture damage and there were signs that it had been repaired previously.On one occasion the elevator doors would not open on the 6th floor and the elevator just went all the way back up to the 32nd floor. Made us and the other guests feel very uncomfortable.Given these pro's and cons, I have rated the hotel as average. I feel bad doing so because the staff deserve a better rating.","March 19, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

I found some hairs (this is a particular pet peeve of mine) and the room was a bit worn down but certainly serviceable.It was nice and quiet which is great. The breakfast was fine, pretty typical for a hotel at this level. The staff at the front desk were very helpful each time I interacted with them. I had them write down the name of where I wanted to go so I could give it to the cab driver after I hailed one in the street. I did take a lot more taxis than I normally do because I found them to be so much cheaper in Hong Kong. That was a nice change.The hotel is right across the street from a tram stop.

However, the rooms are very basic, initially the bed is hard, but we slept ok . Had to request another pillow as only 3 pillows. As we were there for 6 nights there is very little wardrobe space, certainly not enough for 2 people clothes.The first day we went to use the safe only to discover that it required new batteries. We reported this to the reception area, so by the time we got back to the hotel in the evening it was working.The rooms are quite overlooked, so it would be nice to have some nets or blinds, one does not always want to draw the curtains.One point, it is requested that you reuse the towels, however, these are quite thin, hence housekeeping did actually change these every day.On the first day you get a bottle of complimentary water in your room , however if you require further drinking water, then you need to go to floor 5 and near the lifts there is a machine where you can refill your bottles.Breakfast needs sorting out, most days quite early there were a few things that ran out, like bread, pastries rolls, bacon tomato sauce to name a few items. The hotel know how many are booked in and how many are having breakfast, so these items should be checked on frequently, one should not have to keep asking for these items.The fruit juice, was only coloured water, there was no taste.WIFI was good except that every morning you had to keep signing in, which was a bit of a pain.The last annoying thing is the lifts, there are 5 lifts, but only 3 go all the way to the ground floor, and you have to keep putting your key card in the lift to enable you to use the. lift","March 3, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

Staff were efficient with our check-in and the front desk was always manned with the friendly staff. Although we didn’t spend enough time in our rooms to justify the higher rate, the harbour view rooms on the top floors had unbeatable unobstructed views of the Victoria Harbour. Twins rooms were not spacious but had enough breathing room for two persons. While it didn’t cause much inconvenience, the rooms will probably need some fix up soon with some wooden floor panels showing signs of separating and bathroom showers being leaky. The location near Macau Ferry Terminal is superb being less than a kilometer from lot of good restaurants in the Sheung Wan area.

After a light shower, the bathroom floor would be flooded with soap water up to your ankle. There was a very strong smell of bleach or some sort of cleaning detergent that lingered in the room. The team at the reception looked inexperienced and some had problems communicating in English. When asked for assistance to book a taxi, the young lady at the reception looked bewildered and asked me to drag my luggage to streets to hail for one. It was only after a direct request, she reluctantly hired one for my family. Overall, IBIS Central operates like a youth hostel. Expect minimal facilities and service provided if you choose to put up at this DIY styled hotel. ","February 20, 2019","26    Ibis Hong Kong Central & Sheung Wan

Check in process is super fast with the online check-in. My room, #2004, facing the habour. The room is well designed; however, a bit small. Free wifi is avaliable with password. Convenient stores and tram stop are just around the corner. A starbuck coffee shop is located at the hotel 's ground floor.There is a complementary Airport express shuttle bus to the central station very 20 mins. Only one weak spot is shower room cleaness and towel condition shall be improved.

1566,We have stayed a few times at the other two airport hotels (Regal and Novotel) which are themselves very good stopover options. However we tried the Marriott a week ago and it will now be our preferred choice.We arrived from Europe at 8.00 am off a long flight having booked an executive room. Maybe that helped because our allocated room on the 15th floor (no 13 or 14) was available to us by just after 9.00 am (at no additional cost) which meant we were able to get a bit of sleep on arrival. The room was spacious and well appointed with a great shower and decent WiFi. The staff everywhere in the hotel were very polite and helpful and those in the Executive Lounge were particularly friendly and competent. The drinks and snacks in the evening were sufficiently ample so that we needed no other meal that night and breakfast in the morning was equally good. The shuttle to the terminal was quick and on time.This was a top class experience helped by the excellent staff in the lounge.,"July 9, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

I asked if I could have it as it was literally minutes past 10.30, to be told I would be rang back. Chef was asked and point blank no, what great customer service. Yes there is a time but surely sticking a bit of sweet and sour on rather than a full English could be done for a guest. But no, and having read the below comments about customer service and inflexibility towards its customers it now doesn’t surprise me. Manager please don’t reply stating the 10.30 deadline, that’s not the point.

We really liked the place and had a great stay. Just watch you don’t bump yourself on the classic closet door and pointed closet handles. Real high climb over to get in and out of the tub. Make sure you use the hand hold and use the bath mat. Bathmat could have been a longer to cover more of the tub. Even had bath salts and fruit in the room with water and a mini bar.

The hotel is currently renovating guest rooms which is not needed, but is great that they are investing in refreshing the property to maintain it's high standards. The hotel rates a 10 out of 10 for location (airport proximity), a 10 out of 10 for comfort, 9 out of 10 for character, 9 out of 10 for service, 10 out of 10 for amenities, 10 out of 10 for wifi.Check-in was very welcoming and friendly. Check-out was equally pleasant.My guest room was spacious and very well appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room has black-out curtains which were much appreciated for sleeping in in the morning and keeping the room dark. The bathroom is very well equipped and well stocked with amenities. The property has an EXCELLENT fitness centre. It is of sports club quality and size. There is also a lap pool, sauna, steam room and showers. They have an on-site spa for massages, etc.The hotel offers a shuttle between the airport/hotel every 30 minutes on a large bus - it was a very efficiently run operation.This is a GREAT CHOICE for an airport layover hotel, or after arriving overseas and wanting a comfortable start to your visit in Hong Kong.

1586,"I've stayed here about a half-dozen times, so have some degree of authority when making this review.There are some weaknesses in this product:- It is one of two hotels at the airport, and of the two, it is not physically connected. Therefore, it needs to work a bit harder because it's just not as convenient as the other hotel (and therefore not the first choice from a location standpoint).- That said, both hotels sell out -- and sell out fast -- so it can get very, very busy. When people arrive, there tends to be times when people literally arrive by the (shuttle) bus-load, and the lobby gets very busy. - On my most recent stay, I booked two rooms (one for me and my wife, the other for my three young kids), and I specifically asked for them to be connected. So imagine how irritating it is when I checked in and they have several rooms that are of the connecting type, but none side-by-side (which defeats the whole purpose). Really poor planning and room optimization at the front desk, and complete disregard of my special request at the time of booking.That said, here are some positive points that saved this particular stay from being a disaster:- After realizing how silly it was to be giving away all their connecting rooms (and ending up with a number of rooms that had the connecting option, but the other side was occupied), the front desk upgraded me to their next level category which was decently upgraded and had some premium amenities.- For a standard, non-upscale/non-luxury hotel, their lobby restaurant was very pretty good and had some nice perks, like a pressed juice station and plenty of options for vegans. - We were particularly impressed by the excellent service of their restaurant team, particularly the 'captain' and the senior staff there; very warm, friendly, and dedicated. Thank you for going out of your way to assist us and ensure that we had a good meal.- Checkout was otherwise quick and efficient.","April 19, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

1588,"Rate:More or less we spent 40,000 pesos for 2 rooms with 2 queen beds each room for 3days and 2nights with free complimentary breakfast (buffet style) for 4.Ohh by the way, when we checked out we paid more or less 45,000 pesos. That includes the chocolates and water that my niece consumed in our room So if you guys are worried arriving in here with empty stomach, no worries because they got you covered but of course its not for free We did online booking or reservation, they will just ask to enter your CC for it to be valid transaction and then during our check-in they asked again for CC for our payment. Dont worry if they will punch in your payment or some amount on your CC because it will not be charged automatically. What they do is that when the guests are still staying in their facility, they just hold the transaction and it will be just pending. They will just charge your CC once you check out.It will be easier also if you have member's card so that you will be catered faster during the check in process, but if you dont you will have to wait for your turn around 5-10mins only. So its all good.Room:Well maintained. Neat and Clean. 100% Dust-free and Very Spacious.I dont have a decent picture of our room but all I can say is that we had a blast staying here. We all have free access to their wifi, pool areas, sauna etc.Its ""pricy"" for people travelling with a certain budget only but I think you might want to stay with this kind of place when you're with family and wanting to relax and just have a worry-free stay.Our bathroom includes bathtub with cold and hot showers. Its very spacious. They also provided all necessary toiletries, slippers, bathrobe, blower etc.Food:Very satisfied. Serving is more than enough for 1 person (Im talking abt their complimentary breakfast btw).We also got complimentary coffees and teas.They also have resto bar downstairs if you are craving for something else.Food in our room including all the bottled beverages,chocolates,chips,etc they placed all the prices there so no need to call frontdesk from time to time.Service:100% Best Staff Indeed excluding their trainees of course.First I enumerated why I think their staff is indeed the best:1. They will never ever make you wait2. Since not all of them are very fluent in english, they still communicated very well and in a clear manner3. All of them are fond of kids, atleast thats what I noticed and its a plus factor4. They will always guide you in terms of anything and everything5. You will never ever see any one of them being rude or anything else in a negative aspect* I really love them Secondly, their shuttle bus is completely free of charge unlike hotels in the Philippines if you know what Im talking about They have designated schedule for their shuttle buses.

1590,"I have stayed here multiple times and have never regretted any of the stays. I decided to use the hotel again as I had an overnight before a flight out of Hong Kong Airport. The bus is not easy to find with all the works going on but I was sent an email explaining what to do - go to visit the hotel counter at B05 and the lady will tell you how to get to the bus. In fact the lady escorted me down which was welcome after a long flight!The bus goes every half hour (30 mins) and we were soon on our way to the hotel. Check in was fast and I was welcomed like a long lost friend!I had been upgraded to a sea view room but more importantly one of the newly upgraded rooms. Don’t get me wrong - unlike other hotels that go through upgrades - the old rooms normally re showing their age - not here so don’t worry if you are not given an upgraded room.However, this was defiantly an improvement - modern decor, plenty of connectivity at the beds and a nice walk in shower (rather than shower over bath I have had previously). The amenities at Than and are wonderful - I took them to use in the other hotels in my stay!I slept soundly - the only comment I would make - and I hope someone takes note - is that the hairdryer is pathetic - really useless - luckily I had used it briefly the night before or else I would have missed the bus due to the length of time it took to dry my relatively short hair! The only negative in a wonderful stay!I ate in the restaurant - they Man Ho Chinese restaurant does a very good value set meal for hotel guests - it has gone a little fancy with the main course - but otherwise it was nice. The hotel bar did a good cocktail too.I was back on the us in the morning - they have swapped to a large coach which was lucky with all the people waiting to go when I left at 0900.I was given a birthday cake - it was so nice that it was remember when you are the road as much as I am. The staff are wonderful here and the hotel just has a great vibe.As you can gather I will be back - but I can highly recommend this place to anyone - it really is a gem in hotels (not just airport ones but all networks all over the world)!","April 10, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

1592,"The hotel is very nice with good amenities, but the service in the restaurants is lacking. My husband and I are vegan, so we tried to locate menus for the 4 restaurants in our room and on line, but they weren't there, so we went down to the lobby where we will told they were not available. We were told we must go to each restaurant to see each menu which we did. We found we would be able to eat in the Bistro. The Lobby Attendant told us that we would have a choice of ordering off the menu or selecting the buffet which we did not want since most of the selections were not on our diet. When we came down that evening to eat, the hostess was unhappy that we did not want to have the buffet. She finally agreed that we could order from the menu but she insisted that she must seat us near the ""exit"". From that moment on we were treated like outcasts. At least 50 people came in while we were there, all from outside the hotel - ""locals -?"" - and they did not even stop at the hostess stand but proceeded to sit wherever they wanted. We couldn't figure why hotel guests were treated so differently than non-hotel guests. The next morning we had breakfast at the same restaurant as it was the only one serving it. We were seated and given coffee, we got up to get food from the buffet, and our table was occupied when we returned moments later. There certainly is a problem with coordination in the morning. It felt like the restaurants were not owned or managed by the hotel? Would not stay there again because of this treatment even though the hotel is nice.","April 2, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

1593,"Stayed for a conference at Asia world expo. Arrived early and the staff found a room, but they charged for it.....quite a bit. Staff pushed hard to try to get me to upgrade for the remainder of my stay and looked quite offended when I refused to pay almost 8000hkd for the priviliedge...for 4 nights. I had already paid in advance and didn’t want to pay more as we were already paying a premium. The upgrade charge was more than 2.5 times the original fee I had paid. They were fully booked because of a Kpop concert so eager to find someone to upgrade a room at a fee rather than have to do it for free. Room clean and tidy. The controls for the lights were ridiculous and sometimes took up to 15 seconds to work....not much good when trying to get into a pitch black bathroom. Press them twice and they’d turn off when they fancied.Stayed in an accessible room as requested - no shower screen or curtain so floor was soaked. No vanity to put anything on. Very deep bath and difficult to get in and out of. Very slippery.Everything was horribly expensive even by HongKong standards. Ordered room service - a margarita pizza......without a single piece of fresh tomato, and 6 tiny pieces of basil. Need to take out a mortgage to eat in the restaurants.Paid for a late checkout at 7pm but got several calls to ask when we were leaving.Please get rid of the metalwork in the floor on the way to the lifts...trying to drag two suitcases was horrible because of this.... navigating a wheelchair over them was uncomfortable and a hazard.Useful for the conference but that’s it.

1595,As usual stayed here before an early flight. Beds are comfortable. Check in was easy.Wish breakfast started earlier and shuttle to airport ran every 15 minutes instead of ever 30 minutes. Would be nice if executive lounge had drinks and heavier food later as really an airport hotel 24 hour check out and in are expected.Music in lobby is much much too loud.,"March 25, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

1596,"I had a complimentary one night stay at this hotel due to a delayed flight and missed connection. A shuttle service was available to/from the airport terminal and hotel, and is about a ten minute ride each way.The lobby was welcoming, the front desk staff was polite and helpful, and the room overall looked clean. However, with table lamps turned on, one can see that the ledges and lamps needed more thorough dusting.As with most Marriott hotels, the bed was very comfortable. Airconditioning was strong, television selection was sufficient and wifi was complimentary.I was assigned to a handicapped room so it was more spacious. The bathroom was also handicap-friendly although I cannot comment much on its functionality since I am not aware of the needs. I can only say it was slightly difficult to get in and out of the bathtub and shower water could easily wet the floor. I appreciate all hotels that provide bathmats and this bathroom had one. All toiletries were available and housekeeping was quick to provide additional items requested. Overall a satisfactory stay.","March 24, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

I have know idea why the process is so long. The room is big and bed is comfy. During my check out, staff told me that the system is down. I am fair enough to tell them that I have to pay 14 HKD for printing service they get the cash and promise to send me the receipt but I never received it until now. Bad idea but just thinking if staff is not honest to hotel and guest. Actually I really enjoy the stay and appreciate the shuttle service but what happened to me is ruined everything.

1600,"My last three visit in a Marriott hotel has not been as expected. May be the new Company BONVOY is getting too big and less responsive to its loyal customers. I noticed that being a Gold member does not mean anything anymore. Even though prices have been going up I still have been a loyal customer. In the last 9 months I have stayed in Vienna, Budapest, Lisbon, Khao Lak (Thailand) and twice in Hong Kong. I was paying more in staying in a Marriott Hotel all these years, but I was recognized as a Gold member with some benefits. This is not the case any more when I travel outside of the US. (I do not travel in the US) No more benefits as a Gold member, so I decided not to stay at a Marriott Hotel anymore. I can stay in a nice boutique Hotel for less money and a lot more charm and personality. Every country has Boutique Hotels.","March 18, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

I was FORCED to sign a bill for breakfast even though it was included in my package. The food was average, the coffee - no excuse - horrendous truly un drinkable. Twice during breakfast I had Marriott staff push past me to get their food. And more than once was forced to move out of the way of more staff just walking through the dinning room. Decided to go to the Cafe in reception to try to get a decent coffee (Illy) has to wait 15 mins to be served. It’s an absolute Shambles.

1602,"What a mess. I made a reservation via the Marriott app. It's kind of hit or miss whether it sticks. I'm platinum so I've stayed at Marriotts a bit.We found the shuttle after a little running around. It was not the worst experience but Marriott is not at fault for this.I checked in and went to my room with my wife. We get to the room and the door is held open by the sliding latch thing. First thought? ""Uh oh."" Open the door? The room is a complete mess including a slept-in bed.So, we stroll over to the lounge and tell of our story. This is where we met Eris Hui - with a big friendly hello and smile. She proceeds to invite us to sit while she sorts it out for us. She ultimately comes back with a key to a new room on the 9th (what happened to our lounge-level floor?). Walk in and almost suffocate with the smell (which is also in the hallway on 12) from the remodel. The room looks GREAT. We almost passed out (ok, slight exaggeration) from the smell. NO WAY we can sleep in here. So, back to 12. Eris, can you help? She comes back again. She and another person walk us to an upgraded room in the corner. Great big room with a nice view. It's got stained carpets and a few other problems - clearly not (and thankfully) an upgraded room. She also invites us to a glass of wine. We don't drink. She keeps going - ends up on ice cream which made the wife happy. She sends us an ice cream for the 3-room dance. 3 rooms. and stained carpets.Eris is amazing. She's friendly and did a great job caring about solving this and even appeared to feel bad. Thank you for that.We also encountered what turned out to be a guy from concierge on the elevator. super friendly and helpful. We met him again later when we went to concierge and once again very helpful. He gave me a business card - Hong Lee (thank you!) - a friendly helpful guy.The shuttles...oh the shuttles...we took the last shuttle from the MTR back to the hotel and it was clear the driver wanted to get home. I confused him with Mario Andretti. I was in a lot of pain from a back injury from 2 days earlier and it was bad - bouncing all over the place. The wife commented about him racing especially around curves.The airport shuttle in both directions was ok. Due to my injury, it was tough for me to get my suitcase that had receded into the well a bit with the trip. A customer had to help me as the driver (a different driver for a different trip obviously) watched me struggle. Thanks.Most of the staff was good though surprisingly check-in and check-out were nothing special.Usually one can forgive some issues during a remodel but this is a joke. Really messy. Typical Marriott of late except we had great service from Eris.I'm especially concerned by the price - >$300/night for sloppy service, remodeling construction terrible smells and so-so service.","March 15, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

1603,"This hotel is very conveniently situated adjacent to the airport we have stayed here several times recently. While the Concierge Lounge is good, the beds are terrible with the typical sag in the middle. It's a big step down from the higher-quality Marriott's that we've stayed in both Hong Kong and other asia countries. The night prior to departure everyone wanted a good night's sleep but we all woke up from the beds with a little bit of back stress after our 2 weeks of travel.The hotel shuttle runs every 30 minutes and I would recommend taking that the morning of your departure. Be prepared to load your own bags on and off the shuttle bus, you're not getting the same level of loading or unloading service as you would with a taxi driverOn arrival I would just grab the Blue Cab line at Terminal 2 and pay the 25 HKD for the quick drop-off convenience especially keep it on the road awhile","March 14, 2019","27    Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel

1616,WE stayed here one night as part of our honeymoon. We got the BEST service from Ayaka when we checked in (I had already checked in mobily). When she heard it was our honeymoon she made sure our room had a nice view and made sure we had access to a really nice breakfast. When we checked out we still wanted to explore Lantau so we kept our bags with concierge who were also really great and fun to interact with. They helped us with the schedule for the shuttles and took good care of our stuff. The shuttle is an awesome perk and got us from the airport and to the metro station that takes you to the skyline. For us it made sense because we wanted to stay on Lantau island but getting to the rest of Hong Kong wasnt too bad either. The rooms were MUCH better than I expected for an airport hotel.

The neighbourhood itself is a quiet commercial area with not much going on but provides easy access to Ocean Park and the Island Line.The hotel reception is several floors up and was quite busy upon arrival late in the evening.

First ,when we arrived the hotel the staffs who were Jimmy and Eddie in front of the hotel parking ,came and serviced us with their passionate . Taking our packages to our hotel room ,make us more relax to go to the check-in counter. When we got in our hotel room , the packages were already here ,which is efficient and make us feel comfortable. Second , when we decided to upgrade our room , a staff was running up side down between the floor of our old and new rooms to make sure all my family know the changes.He is very responsible and kind.Regarding the recreation in the hotel, It’s was fun and intimate . I had a great experience—friendly advice and help from Evis Lai , the Sports and recreation supervisor.He teach me new and fashionable .

It is quite noisy on the lower levels and with my wife being pregnant and having trouble sleeping we requested another room to which the staff obliged, However we were put in a smoking room which was horrible. Asked to change rooms again if possible as we had requested a non smoking room we were met with a not so friendly staff member! Third time lucky we were put into another room which had twin single beds but we didn't want to go back and ask for the king we had originally booked after the last conversation. Our last day weather was perfect so we decided to relax by the pool but the pool is closed between October and April. No mention of this on website or at time of booking so was really disappointed.

1643,We stayed in L hotel Island South for 5 days recently in our trip to Hong Kong. The hotel is conveniently located on the main street within walking distance to MTR. The room size is decent and big compared to the majority hotels in Hong Kong. Staff were very friendly and the cleaner always asked if we need to have our towels change or coffee/tea top up. A very pleasant lady. The hotel seems to be very busy all the time with conference guests or group tours so allow sufficient time to wait for the lift on the day of checking out. Overall the stay was excellent and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to stay on the southern side of HK island.,"November 12, 2018","28    L'hotel Island South

1644,"The hotel itself was ok i guess, pretty much what was expected in terms of room, cleanliness etc. The service experience I endured however, was one of the worst in my 25 years of travel and hotels. What made it worse was the many glowing reviews of the service right here on trip advisor. My wife and I booked two nights as we were moving house and have two young kids under 8 years old. Given that check-in was listed as 2pm, I turned up at the hotel with my two children at pretty much 2pm, to be told that owing to full occupancy the previous night, my room was still being remade by housekeeping and we would need to wait another 20 minutes. That was irritating to begin with, as my youngest child was approaching regular naptime and I had expected to put him straight down to bed not long after 2pm. It got worse however as after 35 minutes we were still waiting in an uncomfortable lobby area with nothing for my children to do, and no drinks etc. I then approached the same woman at reception, who told me another 10 minutes or so. That 10 minutes dragged on for another 30 minutes or more. By this stage it was around 3:15pm and I just lost it, not something i like to do at anytime, but our treatment was just unacceptable, especially as there appeared to be other people arriving and checking in by this time. Ultimately I was forced to make a big fuss at reception and in view of others, raising my voice and calling for the manager and then of course magically our room was ready. By this time it was approaching 3:30pm, and we had waited for 1.5 hours after the advised check-in time. I don't like to single out individuals but the young woman who tended to us the whole time just didn't seem interested in helping at all. In fact she was the type who didn't appear comfortable speaking to foreigners, found it hard to make eye contact, and quite clearly was just happy for the problem to go away without doing anything about it. Her customer service was non-existent. I'm sorry, but this kind of person does not have a future in hospitality, and whilst i won't name names, whoever was doing the afternoon shift on October 31st needs to be spoken to by management at a bare minimum. I'm sorry but I would never consider staying at this hotel again based on this experience.","November 7, 2018","28    L'hotel Island South

1649,"So....the area around this hotel isn’t probably what you imagine when you go to Hong Kong. It’s a mix of residential and light industrial....Ocean Park is quite close....there’s a complex of newer restaurants (Pizza Express, Vietnamese, Starbucks) and a trendier hotel (Ovolo Southside) close by. But other than that (I guess you could head to Aberdeen too), as either a tourist or business traveler, you’re probably heading north. South Island line is a ~7 minute walk from the hotel, and then 2 stops into Admiralty 金钟。The rooms here are quite big - shockingly so by HK standards. But the hotel opened around 2011 and doesn’t seem to have been renovated much since....so it’s a bit ragged around the edges. Think of it more as a faded three star hotel. Seems to attract lots of mainland tourists / groups. Essentially no real complaints, but I probably wouldn’t stay here again. Convenient enough, but if you have a short stay to “experience” Hong Kong, this probably isn’t the place.","October 14, 2018","28    L'hotel Island South

1652,"My wife and I arrived to find that the room I had booked a few weeks previously was not available but a more than acceptable substitute was found. The room was spacious and clean and the mattress to our preference, suitably firm (which some may not like). Our housekeeping lady, YoYo, was diligent, thorough and friendly - we cannot praise her enough for keeping our room spick and span and essentials replenished. The housekeeping services were quick to respond and efficient. The room’s safe was faulty and I could not access my documents. A call to the front desk resulted in a prompt response and attendance of staff who arrived, took stock, accessed the safe for my documents and had the safe replaced in less than half an hour. The only possible negative is the location. Outside the hotel is a busy roadway of public transport, construction and private vehicles giving rise to a noisy road environment that you are blissfully cocooned from once inside the coolness of the hotel.We have not tried the restaurants so cannot comment.

Although the location is not very convenient and no much entertainment facilities nearby, yet it is quite close to Ocean Park with fair price.Well, something i would like to spotlight about, the gymroom. The gymroom are nice decorated, the tall windows makes the room looks bright. The gymroom coach, Ken provided great service, he is very knowledgeable and professional.

I read one review saying there was no shampoo or shower gel, they were in the bathroom inside a drawer.

Even though it's not right in the city, I do like the fact that the surroundings are not as catastrophic as the ones right in the hub of the city. We are thankful for the staff who helped us with our luggages, and showed us our room personally. To add on a personal touch, there was fresh fruit platter daily too. Well, its more of a business hotel, whereby the bar / lounge is quiet enough for me to do my work in peace. Having a MTR which is 5 mins walk away does help this hotel to score points.

1677,"Been in HK many times, thinking we would try something more ‘local and different’ and, stay in somewhere other than the usual areas.We booked a private double bedroom with en-suite (26th March), which is the same prices as most mid-range hotels in HK.Pros:Heritage building built in the 50’s.Clean room and common areas.Local feel.Cons:1) DREADFUL RECEPTIONIST: we were checked-in by Mandy who was unwelcoming, unprofessional, full of bad attitude and perfunctory. This sort of service gives Hong Kong’s hospitality industry a bad name. Yes, this is a ‘hostel’ but it doesn’t mean it needs to be ‘hostile’ and rude. She almost made us felt that she was doing us a favour by giving us a room! Other receptionists I dealt with, seemed much better. This is the typical case which one member of the team can dent the good work of other members.2) Hostel facilities but not hostel prices.3) The private double bedroom is just 2 mattress push together. Bed is rock hard.4) Poor amenities in room, everything is at extra cost, even to change a towel, costs! 5) Forget about the breakfast! One of the worst breakfasts we have ever had. Don’t know why the bother?! Just go around the corner and plenty of cafes offer decent food.I do not recommend this place other than if you want to stay in their dormitory and go rough.","March 31, 2019","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1680,"Although it's a youth hostel, many guests are not so 'youth.' We were wondering why it's considered as a youth hostel. From the name of it we would expect a back-packer like accommodation with common kitchen, bathroom... etc. Apparently were slightly mistaken... It turned out to be a nicer place than we thought it would be. The hostel is managed professionally, like a hotel... Location wise, it is also beyond our expectation... in a nice way... although the property is located in a super busy area (a bit difficult to find at the beginning), but because it is located in a hilly area, it is quiet and clean. It does't feel like in Hong Kong... From what we see, most guests are from different parts of the globe. The ambience is nice too, feel homy with yummy breakfast served in a common room like a cafe.

1683,"If you're like me, you think a hostel is a somewhat dodgy place that you stay in when you're young and broke. When it comes to Mei Ho House, that could not be further from the truth. This hostel is a former public housing unit that underwent an extensive renovation to become it's current iteration. While there is the traditional hostel bunkbed dorm room, MHH also offers LARGE modernly furnished rooms with a private bath. Your stay also offers you a daily breakfast and access to a very well-curated museum that does an amazing job in conveying the history of public housing in HK, the realities of life in very small quarters and memories of the people who lived in there. The museum really is a gem because it serves as a reminder that HK wasn't always gleaming skyscrapers and wealth. Other details: MHH is located in Sham Shui Po which is great neighborhood to be in. The MTR station is about a 5 min walk. There's tons of amazing, cheap traditional HK foods. And it's an interesting glimpse of a more working class neighborhood. Final verdict: Nice hotels in HK are super expensive. Cheaper hotels or an Airbnb is likely to be crazy tiny. So do yourself a favor and stay at MHH.","December 4, 2018","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1685,Hostel is near road junction close to Sham Shui po station (exit D2 - need to cross junction). Shek kip neo station (exit B2) is a 5-10mins walk away so easy to get to. The hostel take a $500 deposit which is refunded within 2/3 weeks (not yet received this). You pay on arrival but there was a preoayment on my credit card a week before I arrived. Room was big and clean with entry by card. One bad point was that there was no plug socket next to bed. Air con works but you can't leave it turned all day when out on without the entry card as this acts as the power activator.You get breakfast vouchers on arrival - hand this in when getting breakfast. Breakfast is nothing pecial (the baked beans in the western style are given cold! - not ideal. There is a selection of drinks to buy if needed - hostel guests get discount but cheaper is shop across road.On the whole would recommend. However I stayed over the national holiday weekend (didn't know about this when booking) so ended up being quite expensive but it should be cheaper at other times of the year.,"October 1, 2018","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1686,"I chose to stay in Mei Ho house YHA in Kowloon because of the reasonable cost when considering the size of the twin/double room. It also includes breakfast. The room is indeed spacious and clean, with also common room with kitchen and laundry. The staff are also pretty friendly. The location is not far from MTR station and a short ride to the city Centre areas. But what impressed me most is the museum on the ground level, describing how this building came about ( it is one of the earliest public housing built in 1950s) and the role of YHA in the revitalization project. The hostel is located in shamshuipo known to be one of the lower income areas, where you will see older people selling things and begging, reflecting the reality of poverty in the metropolitan city. But it is also a vibrant area with good food and a popular computer mart, attracting many young people. This area also has some other old buildings ( like Garden bakery) for visits.

My bed in an 8 bed dorm was comfy, the individual lockers contained plugs for handy charging, and the 2 bathrooms were cleaned daily, which was excellent as some people liked to soak the place each morning while showering! Free breakfast, whilst a nice and welcomed touch, was an interesting experience- whilst the Asian options proved popular, perhaps cereal and toast would be favorable to the western option. I would recommend the hostel, but would add that there is zero interaction among guests; organised tours would be a nice touch in such a big hostel.

The washing machines worked well, The daily instant coffee packets and water kettle were appreciated. I liked the location. Lots of good local eateries nearby.

1689,"Having stayed in numerous hostels, hotels, Airbnb in Europe, the US, SEAsia, Japan, Korea, India & Pakistan etc, this is the first time I had this weird experience. Stayed with a few friends in different double/ twin rooms for a couple of nights, we all heard chair dragging sounds, heavy cupboard banging noises from upstairs late in the night. Also heard doors opening/ closing sounds from the corridor. Perhaps it’s due to the poor sound insulation as it was originally a public housing block built in the 1950s. Lights went on & off by themselves in the middle of the night and couldn’t be on & off after we had them checked out by the reception. Reception offered is a change of room and fortunately, it’s our last night there too. Hard beds, inconvenient power points but large and basically clean room. No daily cleaning service unless we pay extra. Had stayed in many hostels and had some of my best sleep there ( even in many beds dorm rooms). Some of these hostels have hotel quality bed linen, comfortable beds and pillows, convenient power points & individual lights. Stayed in double/ twin room but no toothbrush/toothpaste, had to strip the bedsheets, pillow cases and comforter sheet to return to reception. No mini fridge? But well, this is a hostel. Pro: 1) Location: hard to find initially by cab but after familiarizing, it’s a 5-10 Min walk to Sham Shui Po MTR. 2) Facilities: nice cafe and convenient store that open till 10-11 pm, outside Terrace seating to chill. Very interesting heritage museum about the history of the hostel and the public housing in HK. 3) Room size: big by HK standard.

Only one point when think about re-visiting is about the roommate. I found that she turned off the air-con during the night (even it’s very warm outside) which i don’t know why because she is uncommunicative in English at all; and keep speaking Chinese to me. The only way to communicate with her is non-verbal. (She looks a bit arrogant but i think i will feel better if we talk the same language). This is an annoying experience. Btw this may go beyond the hostel’s responsibility but rather depends upon my luck. So many times i stayed in hostels in Asia and don’t have any problem with Chinese teenagers; at least they understand English.

I felt really unsafe at night walking to the station and the surrounding area I seen extreme poverty. Please (see photographs) .I thought not a great location at all. I prepaid for 8 nights at the hostel and I managed to last 3 nights , it was fully booked hostel and the girls in the room were extremely rude , being very loud , playing music , talking at 1am - 6am in morning, they didn't care if they woke you , brought in smelly food stunk out the room. i complained to the staff and not once did they try and speak to anyone in the room to be quiet. Obviously after 3 nights of no sleep I had to check out of my 8 night stay and told them as to why I'm leaving , they said "" oh you sometimes get unlucky and get noisy guests"" I asked for a refund for the remaining nights I'm not staying a knew they would sell my bunk to another guest , and they told me to sort it via booking.com Upton my return from travels , were they fair and gave me a refund for my 5 nights I didn't stay ? Even though it a full hostel and my bed would of been sold to someone else yet again making more money ? ....No I didn't get a refund ! In the end I paid for a lovely hotel costing £450 for the remaining 5 nights ! Please anyone please do not stay here if you want safety , security and also a good nights rest , your complaints will get ignored and they will not be fair to you if you leave due to noise and disruption!

The room is new and well-designed so it is at least adequate if you expect a “hostel experience”: less privacy but low cost.

Only one point is that I found the sink drain of my bathing room wasn’t clean well so it got clogged by hairs.

Great location.1) Angry Housekeeping - When we stepped inside the room after check-in, we were dismayed to see a thick layer of dust tangled with hair lying on the floor under the bed. The Front Desk apologized immediately upon receipt of our complaint and sent for a housekeeping person. Few minutes later, an angry-looking lady came to the door with a vacuum cleaner. Instead of saying sorry or showing apologetic for the poor cleaning job done, she said to me bluntly that the dirt was found under the bed because I had shifted the side table. She might not be the person who did the ""sloppy"" cleaning for our room before we checked in, there was no reason for her to make sure that I knew she was angry at me (the guest). 2) Awful Breakfast - After having the first breakfast there, we went out for breakfast for the rest of our stay. Mei House is a hostel, so we did not expect much. Unfortunately, the food was really below standard. 3) Wifi was frustratingly slow.

1698,"The hostel was a multi-million dollar conversion from an old public housing building, so one side of 1st floor was kept as a museum.Stayed 5 nights in 2 room types (8-bed & 4-bed dorms).The counter staff were friendly & helpful.8-bed female dorm (at the back of the building facing the hill):I picked the lower bunk next to the lockers (4x2rows), and used the closest locker (bottom left). The cabinet doors only opens to 90 degree, so accessing the left-most lockers would be a little awkward (it would help if the hinge is along the wall side).The bed was very firm (even by my standard), but clean. Dorm-mates were quite good, no noisy ones (hope I wasn't the noisy one with all my sorting & packing)People seemed not to know there're air-conditioning units within each dorm, but the one on our side of dorm was very noisy when turned on, so I just used the one on the other side. It's good to have 2 bathrooms between a maximum of 8. our timings worked out well, with some early sleepers, and late risers etc..The room was clean, though the cabinet top next to my bed was a little dusty.There weren't enough hooks to share around.4-bed dorm (at the front of the building facing the street):same size room with only 4 single beds. No more locker issue too. Free towel. Still 1 bathroom per 4 person. No hanging rod (though there was a small wardrobe space), but enough hooks to share around. Considerate dorm-mates again (thankfully). The air-conditioning unit on my side was quiet this time, so even the bed was still firm, I slept quite alright.Even there was some construction site next door, but with the windows, I couldn't really hear that going on. Wifi: it's free but I didn't bother with it..... just too slow (my advice if you're staying for more than 1 day: get a sim from 7-11/ Ap-Liu Street) Breakfast: it's free! and 4 choices. Nothing too fancy, but indeed hot breakfast. Otherwise there're heaps if you go into the Sham Shui Po area.Transport: E21 only runs hourly, and I missed one. As it was nearly 9pm on the day of arrival, I ended up taking the airport express to Kowloon station then taxi to the hostel. Otherwise, getting around was pretty easy with the MTR, being a 7-min walk away.There's a track up the hill behind the hostel, which offers a good view. be prepared though, there's quite a few steps to climb. For a clean room on a budget in HK, in a safe & secured building (there's a guard outside 24/7 & single purpose building (instead of other hostels/ guesthouses being nested within residential buildings), and a handy location, you can't beat Mei Ho House.","December 4, 2017","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1699,"Just stay here for 5 nights with my friends in triple bedroom.Our experiences were great.Nice and helpful staffs. Lot of smiles.The triple room is large compared to HK standard.Very clean. They do change your towels once in 3 days, but they clean your room & empty the trashbin everyday.AC works well. Full HD TV, very clear display.Hair dryer available.Bathroom is great, cleaned everyday.The breakfast menu has 4 different choices, not bad.The only weakness was the wifi speed at our room.It was so slow... but it's okay since we have data package at our phone.The location is about 7-10 minutes by walk from nearest MTR Sham Shui Po. There are a lot of shops in nearby area.You can also take bus E21 from airport and alight on Yen Chow street. Don't forget to take their map, it's quite useful.","November 15, 2017","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1700,I stayed here for two nights. It was located in a busy area in the city. Close to the metro supermarkets and next to a large hill which gave a great view of parts of the city. Not a very social place for backpackers. Seemed like it was more for local people and groups. You get a free breakfast but it wasn't very appetising. The staff were friendly. I could hardly get any sleep due to people in my room making weird noises and snoring. One guy even started singing at 1 am for half an hour! There are lockers in the room so I was sure my stuff was safe.If I came back to Hong Kong I would rather stay on Hong Kong island as the area was nicer and there were more backpackers. If I were to return to this hostel I would stay in a private room for definite.,"November 2, 2017","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1702,"We booked ourselves a private room for two, and we were frankly blown away by the quality of the room for the price. We weren't expecting much, but what we got was a fine room, relatively clean, and absolutely huge. This was perfect for us since we were actually going through an overseas move and had a few pieces of luggage. There was plenty of room, and it was perfect for us.The only solid complaint I could have about this place is the breakfast. It was pretty small, and the western breakfast was obviously made by a person that has no idea how to make a western breakfast. Every day something new would be cold, and for some reason it included corn. It's not a reason to avoid this place by any means, but it's a reason to make sure you have alternative plans for breakfast.","October 30, 2017","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

Meals in the restaurant are sub par however, especially breakfast. While you do get 10% off at dinner, I'd avoid this and just go to one of the many local restaurants.

1704,"I stayed at Mei Ho House for two nights. Positives: The beds are quite hard, but I liked that. The duvets and sheets are quite nice. Good air-con is a must in Hong Kong and thankfully the room was nice and cool. I also enjoyed the short hike behind the hostel, which gives a nice view over HK. Improvements: To me, it's always a little stingy when you have to rent a towel, which is the case here. The breakfast could also be improved significantly. I had both the western and Chinese options; both were shockingly bad. It's also a pity they don't allow early check-in, but was nice that they have a free luggage room. Overall, I would stay here again if I couldn't find a better option elsewhere.","August 18, 2017","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1705,"I stayed here for two days to basically run some errands before leaving Hong Kong and was quite satisfied. Even for those not familiar with HK, the hostel should be easy to reach as it's close to the MTR and easy to reach from the airport. The red line is directly connected to major stations such as Mong Kok, TST and Central so ideal for those on a short stay that still want to experience some of the more popular areas. There's also a post office within walking distance.As for the facilities, I stayed in an 8 bed women's dorm and the beds were great, high quality bunks. There were two shower/toilet combos that you only have to share with your roommates and it was all quite clean. The reception is open 24 hours, which is awesome! Late check in is not a problem for that reason.They're also very helpful. I got two free breakfast vouchers and wifi is available, although it was very slow in my room and I ended up using data instead. You can do your laundry yourself in the laundry room, but the washer and dryer BOTH cost HK$30 (approx US$3.8) per cycle which I found a bit much even if you don't need to provide your own detergent. I personally wasn't looking to socialize with other people from the hostel as I was really only looking for a place to sleep, so don't know much about what other type of people stayed here, but I had both young foreign travelers as older guests as my roommates.","June 13, 2017","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1706,The museum at this site is far more interesting. It shows the history of Hong Kong's public housing development from the Shek Kip Mei fire of 1953.Shows the squalor of early tenements to the relative luxury of the modern day flats.The hostel is built from the very flats that once housed whole families.The cafe on the ground floor serves nostalgia as well as good breakfasts and teas.,"June 4, 2017","29    YHA Mei Ho House Youth Hostel

1710,It is clean and room is on the spacious side in Hong Kong standard. We specially like the leminate floor so it is much clean compared to carpet. it is like a 3 stars hotel in a local neighborhood. Very close to computer Golden shoopping center. MTR is 5 min away by foot. Definitely should see the ground floor museum of the old hong kong government housing.There is washer and dryer with hk$30 each cycle detergent incleded. so $60 get you cleaned. there is also a public kitchen with all utensils.

Located in a historic part of Kowloon, in the last surviving H configuration building which used to house the victims of a devastating fire in the area. The building itself is a piece of history. There is a museum inside the hostel which is free to the public. Guests staying in the hostel can enjoy an exclusive crowd-free period every morning before the official opening times. The hostel is spacious, and has a canteen on the ground floor which serves free breakfast (3 styles) to every guest. The 8 bed female dormitory was spacious and light with 2 en-suite bathrooms, The lockers were large with an inbuilt socket, but do remember to bring your own lock! There are so much local eateries around the hostels, in fact some of the best local eats in Hong Kong are located in this area!
