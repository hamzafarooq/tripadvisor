1,"Hotel Francisco is located on Calle de Arenal and a few blocks from Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol. There a restaurants and markets in the immediate vicinity. The hotel itself is stylish, the rooms are clean and well designed.

2,This hotel has a sleek and modern look for an older building.with a great location situated between the puerta del sol and the Opera. The staff could not have been more helpful and we would definitely stay here again on future trips to Madrid. Our room was on the top floor with a balcony and a view of Madrid. However the weather was cool and rainy during our visit so we were unable to use it. It should be noted that the hotel is on a pedestrian only street so it may be necessary to walk a half a block to get a taxi or uber. Shopping and restaurants are abundant within the blocks surrounding the hotel. The hotel is a great value and is highly recommended for a first time visitor to Madrid.,"November 28, 2019","0    Hotel Francisco I

5,"I was always a little surprised when we turned the corner to find our Hotel right there in the middle of a very active pedestrian street. Request a room on the third floor or higher if you have a balcony view of the street to make things a little quieter. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious---for a European hotel. The staff was friendly. We did not sign up for the breakfast buffet, but there were all kinds of coffee and sandwich shops just outside our front door. A very pleasant stay.","November 8, 2019","0    Hotel Francisco I

The hotel is well serviced with a lift which is great with luggage and is spotlessly clean, and cleaned every day. With your windows closed it is amazingly quiet and dark! And it is air conditioned too. Highly recommended - I’ve just booked another night on my way back through Madrid. Other places would be hard pushed to beat it!","October 23, 2019","0    Hotel Francisco I

9,"I normally get my first impression of the hotel when I send emails inquiring about booking. Their prompt replies and feedback to my queries already gave an insight that the way they deal with their patrons is very professional. In fact we ended up arriving late as we had a delay, and when I sent an email to inform the hotel, they replied to my email immediately. When we finally arrived after a three hour delay, we were warmly greeted by Yadian at the reception. He was so helpful going through various things and giving us tips not only on the day, but throughout the whole week we stayed there. Our room was on the top floor as I had requested, it was a nice spacious airy room, with a good sized bathroom and kitchenette . I was surprised how well insulated the rooms were as we did not hear any noise providing us with restful nights. The room was very spacious and immaculately clean as was the bathroom. I was surprised to say the truth with the items provided for example the hairdryer. Such a simple thing but personally I find it's a nightmare to blowdry my hair with the ones usually provided. Their attention to detail and needs of their guests left me quite astounded. Breakfast was delicious too and the staff were really nice. Also the terrace has a breathtaking view of the palace. It was a pity that we visited in December as it would have been nice to sit there and have a drink, but it was too cold in the evenings to stay for more than a few minutes. The hotel is equidistant to two metro stops - Plaza Espana and Principe Pio. This was another plus, apart from the fact of having bus stops just a few steps away from the hotel. Also it's a few metres away from the Royal Palace and walking distance to most of the sights.I would not like to mention names, as I don't want to leave out anyone, but all the staff are so friendly and professional in their approach. You are always greeted with a smile and very helpful in every way. Thanks to everyone for making our short break a memorable and relaxing one. Should we revisit Madrid, obviously we would not even consider looking around anywhere else.","December 22, 2019","1     ApartoSuites Jardines de Sabatini

13,"First of all, we made a stupid mistake and booked the hotel for the wrong nights! It was past those nights when we figured it out. They were kind enough to give us a small discount on the correct nights (we understand they had to charge us for the nights we screwed up). Everyone in this hotel bent over backwards to be helpful and pleasant. The room was amazing - large, clean, comfortable.

Reception staff spoke English (not a common feature in Madrid), were very professional and helpful. Every request was attended to and every query answered. There is no restaurant for evening meals but they do provide a fantastic breakfast in a bright and cheerful hall downstairs. The hotel is a short walking distance from Sabatini Gardens, Royal Palace and local restaurants.

18,"The hotel is located within walking distance (even with luggage) from the airport, so even if you have an early departure/late arrival, there is no problem to get between the place and the airport. The hotel offers a shuttle service, but it runs until 2300 hrs, and fills up fast; it will be much quicker to walk than to wait for the next bus. Rooms are typical old-ibis-style, clean and ok, but they will soon need a refurbishment. If your flight is very delayed, be aware that the hotel may cancel your reservation due to no-show, and you will then need to discuss with the reception. Did not try breakfast, so will not comment on that. If you arrive by car, there may be an issue with finding a parking space close to the hotel.","December 23, 2019","2    Ibis Madrid Aeropuerto Barajas

19,"We arrived at 10 pm after traveling all day. Had made reservations long in advance on recommendation that Ibis hotels are high quality and reasonable. Had reserved double bed with extra bed as our son was traveling with us. He was needing to leave for a flight at 3 am. The front desk check in was very unpleasant with check in person unfriendly and told us our son would not be allowed in the room as he is in his 20s.--though my reservation was printed for double and extra bed. We asked if he could go to the room with us to repack his bag and take a shower and were told no, that only two people could go to the room. Our son returned to the airport to spend the night. In the room in the morning were small bugs on the floor. Hoping this experience is not truly the usual experience with Ibis. ","December 16, 2019","2    Ibis Madrid Aeropuerto Barajas

23,"This hotel ticked all boxes. It is close to Madrid hotel and has also free shuttle service. The staff are very efficient, friendly and fantastic. It has an excellent customer oriented mentality. The staff goes the extra mile to make sure guests are well served. To give an example on departure I had an early flight and there were far more people than places in their small van. Seeing this the receiptionist pro-actively counted the people waiting and asked which airport they are flying from. Then they got complimentary (shared) taxis so that nobody misses the flight. In general the staff has a very good human element when dealing with travellers.The rooms are also up to standard, clean and comfy.

30,"This is a very clean hotel, with the necessary amenities for a budget stay - hair dryer, shampoo, body gel. The shower is strong with good hot water. The room heating is excellent. You have the choice to open the room window if it becomes too stuffy. We just walked to the city centre (although it was at least about 20 minutes, it was enjoyable. we were tourists so we didn't mind).The breakfast spread was excellent for the price.It is quite easy to get to the hotel from the Atocha station if you start off at the right part of the Atocha train station (which is only about 200 metres away)- unfortunately the hotel gave us incomplete, then incorrect instructions. Follow this direction instead: Exit from the Atocha station building with the garden inside. Note that the Atocha station has two buildings. The exit (Salida) name is Emperador Carlos V. From this exit, if you look up, you will see the sign from across the building “Hotel Mediodia”. If you don’t see this sign you exited in the wrong place. There is a crossing directly in front, which you must cross. Then go straight to the laneway and turn right into the street (which is directly behind Hotel Mediodia). You will see about a few doors down on the left the Sleep N Atocha property.Possibly the negative to this property is that the room is on the small side. The reception area is also small and can become quite crowded when there are a few people checking in or waiting for turn to ask questions. I'd still come back to this hotel. This is definitely value for money, but book way ahead as the price I've noticed can double close to the date.","November 8, 2019","3    SLEEP'N Atocha

That said it was basically a step up from a hostel, which I wouldn't have minded, but I paid more than $150 for the one night. For that amount of money it absolutely was not worth it. It had no frills. Not even a tissue box in the room. Not a single piece of furniture to put away anything, although being there one night it wasn't necessary for us. Also it was extremely noisy.

There is tea, coffee and orange juice, hot scrambled eggs and bacon, breads, pastries, cold meats and cheese, yogurt, cereals,fruit and preserves and a toaster to make your toast. You can also buy drinks and snacks which you pay for at reception.The hotel is in a great location. Easy to find, just come out of the front of Atocha train station and it is in a small street directly behind the Hotel Mediodia which you can easily spot as you exit the station. It's easy to reach the major attractions on foot - Reina Sofia 1 minute, Prado 10 -15 minutes, Retiro Park 15 minutes, Plaza De Cibeles 20-25 minutes, Plaza Mayor 25 - 30 minutes, Palacio Real 35 minutes. The Estacion D'Arte metro station is most convenient, you exit it at the front of the Hotel Mediodia. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity.

Our room was nice & up-to-date & I appreciated the personal note & small boxes of candy left in the room. The only place this hotel fell short was the location. You are far away from the city center & have to walk quite a distance to the metro & then it takes a few different lines to get to all the sites. One evening we had reservations for a Flamenco show in the city center so I brought daytime clothing & then a backpack of evening clothing to change into because it was far & inconvenient to go back to our hotel to change. Our safe, also, didn't work & despite someone coming up to show us how to use it, it still didn't work which is frustrating/we needed a safe place to store our passports.

41,"8.0Great visit overall! I would definitely stay here again! We plan to visit their other locations!!The room set up and bath was great! We enjoyed the rain shower!! The terrace was nice, the view not so much but I would've still enjoyed it all the same, providing the weather was a little warmer! Having the Green on the go was very nice!I would've liked to have lemon to go with my tea! I didn't like that there weren't any face towels automatically provided. We had to ask for them. On our last night, they didn't have any available or the gentleman didn't know where to locate them. It also would have been nice to have a microwave in the room to warm up food. We stayed in for a day and had to go down to have our food warmed. Although I truly appreciate them doing that, it was an inconvenience as well.","November 1, 2019","4    Artiem Madrid

The entrance of hotel is pedestrian only but the cab can get you literally half a block away. A short walk (even with rollers on cobblestones) and it is no problem finding the hotel. Location is perfect for walking about 25 minutes to Prado and Reina Sofia. Cab and bus options available too. About 8 euro 10 minute cab ride to the Atocha train station for high speed trains. The plaza is crazy busy filled with people Friday and Saturday nights. Every one enjoys eating and drinking out. Rooms are comfortable and clean. The windows are double paned thick but one still hears the plaza at night. True for any hotel in the area. Nothing a pair of ear plugs can’t fix for a good nights sleep. Cafe downstairs - great for a breakfast cappuccino or a nightcap. Plenty of eating options nearby.","November 26, 2019","5    Hotel Europa

50,"I stayed at Hotel Europa 5 nights in October. I found it's location excellent, being within walking or transit distance of all the sites I was interested in seeing, as well as restaurants and shopping. I did not try the cafe next door. I also found the staff excellent. All that I had contact with were very friendly and helpful. I also enjoyed the reception area with comfortable couches and chairs I used to watch people going by on the street.My room overlooked the outdoor dining and had a balcony. It was narrow but fine for one person. The glass slider to the bathroom was also fine for one person. As others have reported, the rooms would get warm during the day as the air conditioning had been changed to heating. When the sun went down I would open the windows, it it would cool down by the time I closed them and went to bed. I especially liked the comfort of the bed and the small frig for storing leftovers.To reach the hotel, from the airport, I took the Airport Shuttle to the Fuente de Cibeles and subway 2 stops to the front door. Returning to the airport, for a very early flight, I walked to the other side of Cibeles (10 minutes) and took the shuttle back.I would recommend this hotel and if returning to Madrid, I would stay there again.","November 20, 2019","5    Hotel Europa

The hotel is great and perfect for my 10 night business/vacation trip. The staff was the most friendly that I've ever seen at any hotel. I'm a native English speaker but can speak Spanish on a B2 level. None of that really mattered. Most, if not all, of them spoke fluent English, French, and Spanish. One even spoke Portuguese. I arrived early and was able to drop my luggage off in a secure area while my room was being prepared and while I explored the city. The breakfast buffet was great and they even have a tapas bar for dinner if you'd rather stay in. The neighborhood (Malasaña) was super convenient to everything whether you want to walk or ride the metro (Bilbao station minutes away). The wifi was great and I was able to work in the room except for the times they were cleaning it. I will definitely stay here the next time I go to Madrid.","August 5, 2019","9    Ibis Madrid Centro

96,"Although being Accor Platinum Member and used to some bad Ibis hotels this one casts a new light on the word bad and accor. It is unbelievable how practically a youth hostal can be called a hotel, (and even get such good ratings (where do these people stay normally, in tents or caves?), and still charge 90us for a room I wouldn’t even accommodate my worst enemy in.No idea where to start. First I get a more than unwelcome reception by a terrible employee called Marta, more unprofessional impossible. She will get a special mention on my next meeting with regional Accor Board in Ontario,Ca (Hope they can get after someone even when it’s not North America, who should rather be employed in a prison compound)then you get practically a bed with a 1m2 shower, a plastic cup and neither a wardrobe,nor a fridge,nor a safety box,nor any Coffee maker. Not even one drawer and the whole lobby being torn apart for renovations. Any decent hotel would be closed, not this one, of course not.Back to the luxury rooms : Not even a toothbrush or anything. Only a gulag appropriate soap dispenser and a small bathing towel, no others ! Nothing for the hands or face.Not even welcome amenities for Platinum members. Wow...and I complained cookies in Hongkong and thought that was cheap,lolFor 30 us bearable, for 100 an outright fraud, no other word for this. This was my second and last ibis in Europe. I couldn’t believe how bad and miserable an ibis can be. I will never again complain about the ones in Asia after this. Wow ....A pity it’s not possible to leave negative points ,this would be an ideal canditdate. Stay far,far away from this place.The fun thing, not joking. The construction was so bad, when someone normally was shutting the door to the hallway your bed was shaking . REALLY NOT MAKING IT UP! For me it doesn’t matter, I travel a lot to Spain ,but if this is your first time, do yourself a favor and get a decent hotel. The only practical thing was the metro stop Suanzes, Line 5. A tip. If you are on a budget but don’t want to spoil your holidays, move half a mile south to Ilunion Alcala Norte, it costs maybe 20 us more but you get a solid 4 star hotel, not this ridiculous ibis.I really felt unwelcome.... They think they can get away with it because normal travelers aren’t very demanding or wouldn’t bother to report them, well I will. Good Riddance.okay never again.

108,"The only good thing about this hotel is its location which allows you to stay not too far away from some of the city’s attractions. But you can easily find a much better hotel much closer to the city center. The stuff is ridiculously unhelpful. At the reception they can’t even provide you with the basic information about the city. Every hotel with the status like this should book the restaurant for its customers if asked to. Not only they didn’t do this, but they didn’t even tell us where we can go to have a dinner. The rooms are always dirty. The towels smell bad and the bedsheets look like they’ve never been washed before (the picture is attached). Even though my room was cleaned every morning, I had to call the cleaning service every evening and closely monitor them change my bedsheets because otherwise I’d have to sleep in dirt. The rooms themselves are really small and the walls are very thin. Every night I had to listen to all the noise from the streets. Impossible to sleep. And it’s always cold in the room. The shower is hard to use. The pressure is too heavy. The shower doesn’t close so the bathroom floor was always wet. The food at the breakfast is not good either. I liked the fresh juice but all the food was bad. Everything was always cold even the things that are impossible to eat cold. The fruits and the vegetables were too soft and tasteless.

There is a small refrigerator in the room that thankfully was not filled with mini-bar items like other hotels. Instead, it had two complementary bottles of water. The bathroom felt modern and had good amenities. There was only a shower, no tub. However, the shower lacked a door and the glass panel that’s supposed to keep water from splashing into the rest of the bathroom was not big enough. This was especially the case when using the overhead nozzle resulting in water getting into the rest of the bathroom. The TV in the room was quite big and had a good selection of international channels. The hotel buffet was very good. Both for dinner and breakfast, there was a good selection of choices. Items though were more generic in style rather than having any Spanish feel to the cuisine. There was ample and spacious seating. The hotel is located in the heart of Madrid and major attractions are accessible by taxi. There is a taxi stand by the hotel.

One of which you take towards the airport (40 mins journey time). The guest house is on the sixth floor of a securely locked building, with a private entrance again, once you get to floor six. The guest house is owned my mother and son (Charo and Raul), who are both very friendly and helpful. Mother doesn’t speak English, but son does. Our room (number four), though quite small, was two single beds, with a bathroom with shower and toilet. It was complete with tv and safe, in wardrobe. The only grumble I’d have, is with the floors been wooden, wooden doors on room and bathroom, it creates a fair bit of noise when other guests are moving about and opening/closing. Sometimes it was like been in the same room ! However, the plus points outweigh this only minus. The room was clean, warm and towels changed daily. The location is superb for walking to all the local attractions, or jumping on the excellent metro. If you’re on a reasonable budget, this is a very good place to stay.

The rooms are small but clean.The room we stayed in was with a shower & toilet.The small window had a nice restricted view.The best part of this place is the lady who owns the place & her son.She is such a nice person & will make you feel at home with her care & warm welcome.She can only speak Spanish & hence if you are English speaking you could have some problems.But her son speaks English so that is not a real issue.He too is very helpful.So if you are one of those who does not mind not having the option of tea/coffee or breakfast inside your hotel, this is a wonderful place to stay.There are lots of food joints down below on the main street.","January 3, 2018","13    Hospedaje Romero

123,"In all my years of travel, I have never felt more warmly welcomed and cared for than I was at Hospedaje Romero. The location is perfect for tourists: close to parks, historical sites, restaurants, public transportation, and shopping. The hostess was delightful to talk to and thoroughly knowledgeable about not only the local area, but also about all of Spain. The next time I visit Madrid, I will definitely stay at Hospedaje Romero again!","November 1, 2017","13    Hospedaje Romero

124,"I spent my birthday in Madrid (March 2 to March 6) and I was overwhelmed by the kindness and support of the lady in the hotel. She gave us also a lot of tips. The Hospedaje is absolutely central, you can walk to all locations. There is also the metro station plaza de Espagna in 5 min walk. I would absolutely recommend. The hotel is in an old and perfectly held palace (the glass windows and the lift are absolutely stunning). To those who want breakfast: There are plenty of cafes near the hotel - and in Spain it is no use (like in bella Italia) to eat so much in the morning.

The hotel was simple, clean, and had a solid location near the Alfonso XIII metro station and several restaurants, bodegas, and other amenities. The rooms were a lot nicer than I expected, and my compatriots and I had no complaints regarding the bathrooms, closet space, and comfy beds. Our few interactions with the staff were pleasant, and they seemed genuinely responsive to our needs. Would highly recommend.","December 8, 2019","14    ILUNION Suites Madrid

127,"Stayed here for two nights earlier this week due to working commitments. Decent location as plenty of stores and restaurants in walking distance, underground only a 5 min walk and the cab to and from the airport was also only around 20 mins outside of rush hour. Room was small but clean, certainly functional. Staff were friendly enough. Breakfast had plenty of choice and hot food available on request. Plenty of bread, cheese, ham etc. Big screen in the bar for sport. Ideal for a business trip, but I don’t think this is ideal for family or a couple sightseeing as it is just a bit too functional for that for me. Would stay here again if working locally.

128,"1. Very noisy. Hard, uncarpeted floors. Poor soundproofing. In the room next to me I was disturbed by a woman walking in heels on the floor - seemingly endlessly.2. The washbasin in the bathroom was small with a fixed tap extending a long way over it. This made it difficult to wash ones face, etc. It was also sort of ""freestanding"" on a formica bench. No where to put soap!3. The shower in the bathroom (which worked perfectly well) was over the bath. There was no hand rail to hold on to to assist in getting into or out of thebat. This is not good for older guests.4. There were NO drawers in the room. This is amazing for a so-called 4* hotel. 5. There was no suitcase rack. This made it difficult to find a suitable location to store my suitcase. And for a double room I would have expected 2 racks.6. The entrance passage was lit with a strange purple colour. This made it feel like entering a brothel!7. On the other hand, the bed was comfortable but narrow-ish. The towels were good. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The location was good (only 100m from a Metro station.8. We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the food. However there was a very nice cafe/bar next door but three, called Los Torreznos.

Staff were nice and helpful, the lady who cleaned the bedrooms was just lovely and so helpful. We stayed for 3 nights. It was good value. Mark down is because there was a fault with the security reader in the machine in the lift which meant anyone could access your hotel floor from the lift. Made us feel very uneasy.

It was comfortable, quiet, and our family room was extremely spacious. I would definitely stay here again.

I asked for a taxi to get to the airport in the early morning, they tried calling the taxi service once and then apologized they didn't answer and told me to stand on the street...No taxi's came in 15 minutes so I requested an Uber.I didn’t like that you don’t truly get a breakfast even though the property is called B&B. You get a bag delivered to your door daily with the same items, croissant, lemon muffin and one water-even though we were 2 guests we only got one water per person however we did get 2 of each mini pastry daily. If you want coffee to go with it, you need to go to the 5th floor to get it. Coffee, tea and juices available all day on the 5th floor.

It was quiet, had comfortable beds and pillows, a great rain shower, is in a safe and central location, has helpful staff, rooms have little fridges, and the upstairs terrace is a great meeting place with beverages and food available at all hours. We could easily walk on a side street to the interesting university district with restaurants, shops and markets. And the San Miguel Market isn’t too far away. The Tribunal metro stop is only about 10 minutes walk from this hotel.We also appreciate that this is the first hotel chain in Spain that has removed all of the disposable plastic in its rooms.

Take the metro as that's quicker and ten times cheaper than taxis, who in our experience will just drop you where they want and not where you are going.

168,"An excellent value for money hotel, you get a high end modern accommodation for the price of mid class hotels in the city center. The hotel is located a bit outside the typical tourist area. However if you’re a business traveler and want proximity to the business district you are a stones throw from plaza Castilla. The staff is super friendly. The rooms are large and are correctly equipped. The big pluses for me are the comfortable beds and the large walk-in showers. It also has an outside pool, a gym, a restaurant with quite alright food, a roof top bar, Try it, it is well worth staying at, whether you travel for business or pleasure.","October 28, 2019","18    Barcelo Imagine

171,"My friend and I stayed here a few weeks ago and we were pleasantly surprised! This was definitely not your average ""hostel"". It was more like a 3 - 4 star hotel. Staff were friendly. I did email a few times before my trip to request twin beds in our room, but we were given a double bed instead, although this wasn't a big issue.The room was clean and cosy, and had a mini bathroom, TV, fridge, arm chair, dressing table and free toiletries plus our towels were changed every other day. It took a while for our air-con to kick in but it was fine after that. Breakfast was good and there was lots of variety. There was cereal, a range of hot drinks, orange/ apple juice, yoghurts, pastries, mini pizza slices, fruit, ham and cheese board and baguettes. Location on Gran Via was brilliant too as it was similar to Oxford Street so it was nice and central. We were a little thrown off by the outside of the building but it is basically a big apartment block with a different hostel on each floor. There are loads of bars, restaurants and shops within walking distance of the hotel and also several metro stations. My favourite restaurant was 'Salvador Bachiller's greenhouse' which was in the basement of a retail shop a few doors down and IT WAS AMAZING!!Overall, if you're after cheap and cheerful accommodation in the centre of Madrid, then Vitium Urban Suites is definitely the place to go!","September 3, 2019","19    Vitium Urban Suites

173,"A very modern hotel. The decorations are very nice. The room was clean. The bed big enough for two. The bathroom was a bit small. Breakfast was very good. They'll cook eggs for you and you actually had real coffee to drink. Of course, don't expect Grade A coffee, but it was fine if you're not picky. The location is walkable to the Palace/Church and Plaza Espana. Metro is close from a couple of different stops. Even though I think the hotel was near full (if not completely full) it was very quiet. Downsides? Elevator is small (seems like a lot of them are in Europe) and slow. As I mentioned the bathroom was small. The a/c was turned off for the season as it seems that the heat and the a/c can't run at the same time. Beware if you're going in the Spring or Fall. We had an incident where I spilled a glass of wine and it went everywhere on the bed. Since it was evening, there was no housekeeping and the guy at the front desk had to scramble to find a broom and new sheets/blankets for the bed, but he managed to do it so that was nice.","November 13, 2018","19    Vitium Urban Suites

Bed confy and although our room overlooked the main road we could barely hear any outside noise. Breakfast was good although the cutlery and plates ect was not always very clean and it would be nice to be able to get a clean plate if you wanted to get more food, However there was always plenty and the maids were always friendly and would try and help although there english was not very good.Access to the room is via buzzer system where you have to press each time you want to get access from the road or onto each floor (card unlocks your room door) although most of the time they opened the door within a few seconds sometimes it felt longer and got a bit tiresome having to do it everytime. I appreciate it is for security but it would be car easier if the card gave you acceess to the front door and each floor. Not a major issue just something that could be improved.

The information of the website does not provide the daily parking rate in order to allow travellers to compare with other hotels.

178,"Although Vitium Urban Suites is on the Gran Via, one of the main streets in Madrid, I think it's located just slightly too far northwest on the street to be entirely convenient. Closer to the metro stop Gran Via is a bit easier to get around. However, there are 2 metro stations very close (Santo Domingo & Plaza de Espana) and also tons of bars, restaurants, and shopping just outside the door.If you choose to take public transport from the airport, you can take the Cercanias rail to Chamartin, then transfer to the metro to Plaza de Espana. From there it's about a 5 minute walk.The building is currently (late March/ early April 2017) undergoing renovations. When you arrive at the hotel, the doorway is beneath scaffolding. It seemed the front door remained open during the day but then was locked at night, at which point you had to buzz to be let in. Although reception always buzzed you in promptly, I prefer locations where your keycard can also open the front door. Luckily there is an elevator, though small and slow. The door to the hotel itself is sometimes open or again sometimes you need to buzz.My room 511 did not face Gran Via but rather a smaller street behind it. However, the building opposite was undergoing construction, so it was a bit noisy when they began working in the morning. In addition, it faced several terraces, so if people are loud out on their terrace, you will hear it. Of course the hotel cannot control this but just be aware it may not be the quietest spot.The room was small but adequate; the bathroom was really tiny. A miniature sink and you practically touched the opposite wall while sitting on the toilet. The shower had good pressure and both a normal shower head and a rain shower (though I never did figure out how to use the rain shower). Both room and bathroom were clean and definitely looked new.Considering the size of the room, there was surprisingly decent storage space - a closet, several shelves, a large desk, and the top of the minibar. There was an easy to use safe in the closet. There was a sort of shelf along the wall behind the bed but no nightstand which would have been more convenient. Also no luggage rack.I did not use the minibar but it was well-stocked and not terribly expensive.The negative aspects: the wifi was terrible, constantly going in and out. I use roaming so I would start a Skype/ Whatsapp call anticipating using wifi, only to have it cut out at some point during the call and switch to data... be careful. And also, they twice did not bring me a new bathmat. I do not tend to reuse bathmats or towels and had in fact tossed the used, wet mat in the corner, only to discover when I returned to the room that they retrieved it. refolded it, and placed it back in the bathroom! That day they also did not bring me a fresh hand towel. I went to the desk and they were happy to give me a new mat and towel, but then the same thing happened the next day. This time when I went to the desk I was a little irritated and the man told me they only replace the bathmat every other day (though he did again give me a fresh one). This is super odd in a modern location such as this one when they do replace the rest of the towels daily.There were at least 4 people working at reception and some were friendlier than others, though all were helpful with buses, maps, etc.This is a okay choice if you get a great deal but I do not think I would seek out staying there again.","April 10, 2017","19    Vitium Urban Suites

Great value, in the heart of downtown, and offered a great 3-course meal (soup, paella, and ice cream with unlimited sangria or beer) and opportunity for good conversation with the fellow travellers. Despite being in my 40’s I met similar ages staying over from all around the world. The security was good (given a wrist band to unlock your particular room. However, also as with any hostel, it’s a dorm style room of many beds and public sinks. I was given a top bunk and although everything was clean, the bed was not the most comfortable. The noise of the comings and goings of other travellers made for a disturbed few hours of sleep before my flight. I left in the early morning for my return flight - all in all a unique experience that I would have truly enjoyed during my university student days, but not recommended for a middle aged professional used to her creature comforts and some luxury!","December 2, 2019","20    OK Hostel Madrid

Check in was fine with a very honest receptionist who gave me a call after noticing I left my wallet with passport and important cards and money on the reception desk. Room disappointing as the coffee service lacked of creamers, decaf and tea. Old furniture, with a 15 year old TV I never managed to turn on.

He was extremely upset for our minute-delay despite being no one but us on the way to the airport. Once on the shuttle, he started to SHOUT AND SCOLDING US for our delayAs shocked as I was for such treatment, I asked him to please refrain from shouting at us and just drive and he kept talking and talking, UNBELIEVABLE! I was under antistress treatment and he managed to make me shout back at him causing me taquicardia and had to shout back to PLEASE SHUT UP AND END THIS ABSURD AND UNNECESSARY CHAT. I asked him his name to report him and he denied to gave me the info, clearly aware of what he did. The worst part was calling to reception and instead of receiving and apology, had a lady on the phone DEFENDING the guy... OUTRAGEOUS!!!","December 19, 2019","22    Hotel Maydrit Airport

199,I have used this hotel on several occasions when stopping in Madrid to change the plane to another European destination. They have a very convenient shuttle bus from the airport and the metro is within walking distance to get downtown. The rooms are clean and well fitted and the breakfast very decent. This is mainly a hotel for the business travelers. I recommend it for the good value for money.,"December 10, 2019","22    Hotel Maydrit Airport

201,"I really liked this hotel, was reasonable priced for the quality of the hotel, room, food and airport transfer. The staff was really friendly when I called asking for hotel transfer from the airport to the Hotel, which they OFFER, they told me to call the hotel as soon as I left the plane or in case you had checked your bags, as soon as you get them, and I did we waited 20 mins, could have been less but one bus had just took off with other clients. The journey to the hotel is 10 mins, as we arrived our room was already available and the room was really good, quite spacious, a nice big and comfortable bed. The bathroom was amazing, really simple and modern, with a bathtub and a shower, two sinks and some counter space, nice toiletries. Overall the room was really good for the price and location, really clean, nice breakfast and nice staff ( English could be better). The metro stations was a nice 3 minute walk, cool and quiet neighborhood, journey to city center is quite long, 28/30 minutes buy metro/underground but we already knew about that. This is a good hotel, close to airport which for us was good we didn’t want to be stressed about catching our flight back, you can book your airport transfer at front desk.

208,"Fantastic hotel for its price. My experience started with the greeter who opened our taxi door and brought it our luggage. Not only did he help bring the luggage to our room, he also gave me a quick tour of our room! Remarkable. The check-in was painless and front desk was also very attentive with maps and tips on where to visit where to shop. The room was among some of the most modern/high tech room I have ever stayed at for a hotel, almost everything is automatic with a push of a switch. They also provide free water, free soda and free juice. Since it’s our first time in Spain, I am not sure if this Is normal or if it’s just them. Room is clean and well kept, I feel safe in the establishment. Location is ideal, it’s literally right next to the royals palace. If I ever come back to Madrid, this hotel will definitely be my hotel of choice again. One thing I do want to mention to the hotel mgmt is about the house keeping team. They like to knock on room early. I stayed for 2 days and it happened both days!! One was to come finish up the bed cover? And other was straight house keeping. We were still sleeping, it was only 10-11 am!!! Kind of early for house keeping? I find that so strange !! Other than that. No other issues at allll!Price : 3/5 (price vs value, the lower the score the better the value for the price you paid, doesn’t mean cheap)Cleanliness:5/5Friendliness:5/5Convenience:4.5/5","December 9, 2019","23    VP Plaza Espana Design

209,"This hotel has got to be one of the sexiest hotels I've stayed at, beautiful contemporary design, with satisfyingly enough space. The rooms were gorgeous, and the bathroom was beautiful. The location of the hotel was above average. One disappointment I had was when I ordered uber eats. When the guy arrived, he couldn't go on the elevator for security reasons, which I understand. We called downstairs and the lady who picked up the phone said yes, the guy is here. I asked her if she could let him up, in which she replied no, but I can bring it to you. Terrific 5-star response! Twenty seconds after hanging up, a man called and told my wife NO, we cannot let him in or bring it up to you, come down and get it yourself... WTF HORRIBLE RESPONSE! Customers are always right, especially if it's an easy issue to resolve, wish I had got the ""gentleman's"" name. The next issue was... the ceiling leaked! See attached image, apparently, when whoever showered in the room above us, it caused the rip in the ceiling and starting streaming his dirty shower water into my room. My daughter, who is 2, discovered it when she walked in there, slipped and started crying. My wife and I ran into the bathroom and immediately called front desk. They sent someone up to comfirm what happened. Front desk called again and when I informed him what happend, didn't even offer medical assistance...WOW. Didn't even offer another room until I said my daughter had slipped..WOW again. 5 star hotel with 3 star customer service.","December 6, 2019","23    VP Plaza Espana Design

Definitely one of the highlights was Haydem at the lobby bar he was a genuinely friendly person that was very informative and great to talk to while grabbing a quick drink. We went back almost every night for his company and conversation. The concierge was also great the gentleman who helped us on the first day was very informative and arranged everything from our day tours to our train tickets.

224,"My wife and I chose the Only YOU Hotel Atocha due to the strong Tripadvisor reviews and it's proximity to the Atocha train station. The experience was a mixed bag. On the positive side, the hotel is very convenient for guests arriving or leaving Madrid by train; it's literally within eye sight across a main avenue from the train station. In addition, the reception desk team in the hotel were very personable and helpful. The hotel also makes an effort, sometimes successfully, to be lively and artsy. For example, our floor in the hotel had an art piece comprised of about 25 ping pong paddles. The wall art in our room was kind of silly, but no big deal. On the negative side, Only YOU Atocha rooms are quite small and the hallways are a bit narrow and bleak. Secondly, the lobby is a very busy place. It attracts a lot of people for food and drink, coming from the close-by train station. After our check-in to the hotel, we tried to have lunch in the hotel restaurant. We were told if we didn't have a reservation, we would have to wait 15 to 20 minutes. That was fine, but once seated, we were not served or even acknowledged for another 10 to 15 minutes. Other restaurant patrons on either side of us that were seated after us were served much more quickly. Once our drinks were finally provided, we subsequently only got a chance to order food after a thoughtful Spanish-speaking couple at an adjoining table felt sorry for us, and spoke to a server. Lastly, because the hotel is on a major thoroughfare (Paseo de la Infanta Isabel) and across from the station, the street noise is very loud. Lots of car honking, sirens, etc.that can be heard from the rooms. If staying here, we recommend requesting a room of the other side of the hotel. Don't be lured by the ""balconies"" facing the busy street. The balconies are very small and not useable anyway.","November 24, 2019","24    Only YOU Hotel Atocha

Staff extremely helpful. Only negative was the noise you could here from outside, adjacent rooms and corridors.

243,"Overall very disappointed with the Ibis. We booked this room because it was reasonable value, allowed pets and had free parking. When we arrived we were immediately told the parking was not available so we had to drive around the corner (+€24). We were charged €15 for our dog as well (we later discovered that the literature said it was €10). The room was ok, but much smaller than pictured when we booked, and the window opened to an alley directly facing a bleak wall - very depressing and dark! The buffet breakfast was €9 and did not include any hot food. We also ordered two €9 pizzas to our rooms and were charged €25 on checkout. Overpriced and not in the best location either. We won't be staying there again!","December 25, 2019","27    ibis Madrid Centro Las Ventas

247,"I went to Madrid to meet up with friends and know the city because I studied there for a semester. I just stayed at this hotel last weekend. Before I arrived, I almost changed my reservation to stay closer to the Gran Via, but glad I did not!!!!!!! It was a great location with the metro across the street and also a nice walk to different areas of the city. There is are places to eat all around and a couple of supermarkets if you just want to buy a bottle of water. The staff was incredibly nice!!!!!!!!! The breakfast buffet was included and was satisfying and typical of an European breakfast. My one little minor complaint, I wish their were electric outlets closer to my bed or on the side of the bed. I would stay there again!!","October 14, 2019","27    ibis Madrid Centro Las Ventas

248,"We stayed here for a second time after our first visit a few years back was faultless.The two key features for us were location and price - it's literally across the road from a metro station and you can be within the city centre in minutes. It's also much cheaper than most central Madrid accommodation, and you know you're getting a good standard.The only reason I can't award it 5 stars is because the rooms are still somewhat lacking - no safe's in the room, TV could only pick up a handful of channels and the air-con struggles if the temperature outside goes above 30. It's a two minute walk down the road from a good selection of local cafe's and restaurants, as well as a few burger places.Don't let any of the above put you off though - the staff were brilliant, the rooms were kept spotless. I'd stay here again.","October 7, 2019","27    ibis Madrid Centro Las Ventas

249,"We stayed at this hotel last year and had a great stay, so we didn’t think twice about booking it again. We stayed in a superior room last time, which had a seating area next to the tv and a raised platform with seating next to the window.This year we decided to book one of the penthouse rooms with an outdoor terrace/patio expecting it to be as large as the room we had last year, we were wrong.On entering, the room was a weird shape, narrow entrance hall, straight into the desk area. There was a huge pillar in the centre of the room and there was very little room either side of the bed. The terrace though was brilliant! Large and quite private, with two chairs and a table. We loved the view over the city and las ventas. We were here during the heatwave in mid to late June.....the air con system just could not cope so we took matters into our own hands and purchased a room fan from the shop next door, €15 we didn’t have to spend but it made sleeping a lot easier!There are no tea/coffee facilities in these rooms so take a travel kettle! This led to another problem with the room, only one plug socket, under the desk. Annoying to the modern traveller, when you have phones and cameras to charge!The staff are really friendly here and our room was serviced daily to a good standard. Location is ok with a metro stop opposite and plenty of restaurants nearby. If you don’t want to stay in the thick of the tourist hotspots, this is your place! This is also reflected in the price, as it is much cheaper than other ibis/Accor hotels in Madrid city centre.","October 2, 2019","27    ibis Madrid Centro Las Ventas

257,"I loved Suites Viena (""SV"").The hotel is great, but I loved the location. It's two blocks off Pl de Espana, which means quiet, convenience, and transportation. The hotel is in a quiet street but there are many shops and restaurants nearby. It's a quick walk to Gran Via, the Royal Palace, and Sol / Plaza Mayor. You can even walk to Retiro and the museums in about 25-30 minutes. The Pl de Espana metro stop is very close as well and makes for a quick trip to the airport (about 40 minutes) and Atocha (20-30 minutes).The hotel is nice, looks pretty new (but I think it's been there a while). The room was much bigger than I expected. The staff were pretty nice, esp the housekeepers. Wifi worked well in my room. I didn't do the hotel breakfast - there are many nearby breakfast places (Cafe y Te, Faborit, Starbucks, etc). There's a safe and a little fridge in my room as well as a kitchenette. There's a little supermarket nearby if you want to make/eat breakfast in bed. The hotel has a garage.The hotel was a great value. I would pick SV again for a stay in Madrid.

268,"I was slightly disappointed in my recent stay here. The hotel is not bad, its in a great location and the staff is very accommodating. But I think they are trying too hard to be ""cool"" and in doing so they kind of sacrifice function and convenience. Lobby is relatively unimpressive and oddly laid out. Hotel is quite dark and musty. Rooms are huge yes, but almost too big. I reserved a premium room because it said it had a tub and it didn't so they kindly upgraded us to a junior suite - again, staff is great. The room is enormous, but not really a good use of space or decorated very well. The color scheme was a bit drab, all browns, furniture in the sitting area was very hard and not comfortable. The bed linens are nice, but mattress was a bit too firm for our liking. Bathroom was huge and had nice molton brown toiletries. On the last day, the bathroom smelled a bit like mold or sewage and the toilet clogged. They fixed right away however. For as big as the room is they have plenty of space to put a full length mirror, but instead they have one inside the closet door which doesn't really open that wide and hard to use. We ordered room service one evening and it wasn't very good. Location is good, close to Centro. Staff is amazing and very accommodating tht room. I give them A+. The towels and linens and all great. The hotel was quiet, I never heard my neighbors. They do have a nice pool -shallow though- which would be nice in the summer. Courtyard in back is also quite pleasant. Had it not been raining we would have spent more time there. Overall it was okay. I just think they are trying too hard. I probably wouldn't stay here again. Maybe it's just not for us.

There was more than enough closet space to put clothes away and store luggage. Safe was a plus. There was a good selection for the breakfast buffet and eggs can be made to order. Location was the best as it was close to the metro and walking distance to the major attractions. Wish we had more time to explore the hotel more.

270,"A great choice in the centre of Madrid; easily accessible by public transport and from the airport by Metro. The hotel is within walking distance of all the attractions that central Madrid has to offer.The staff were friendly and helpful and check in was efficient. My room on the 7th floor was adequate for a city stay - typical European size, but spacious enough not to feel crammed. The room was clean and in good condition with complimentary tea/coffee making facilities. The en-suite washroom with a shower had complimentary Avena products as well as large comfortable dressing gowns.Breakfast was served at El Gato Canalla and although not massive had everything you’d need from a breakfast buffet - cheeses, meats, vegetables, juices, breads, cereals and more. Gluten free products are available on the buffet as well as bread rolls on request. If your rate is inclusive of breakfast then in addition to the buffet, you get the choice of a hot meal from the a la carte menu. The evening menu is also very interesting and reservations are recommended especially at the weekend, as we were not able to get a walk in table, even though we arrived early while the restaurant was still empty.The bar by reception is also a nice place to relax and have a drink.During our stay, the Sky Lounge and rooftop pool were closed for renovation. The one thing that I found extremely disappointing about my stay, was the initial contact I had with the hotel prior to arrival. Three days prior to arrival, I e-mailed the hotel advising of my late evening arrival and requesting a room close to friends who were also staying at the hotel at the same time. Without even acknowledging my request, the reservations staff proceeded to pre-charge the payment for the room (I booked a flexible rate), and for some reason were unable to do so. I then received an email informing me of this and advising me that if payment is not sorted within 48 hours they would have to cancel my booking. I found this to be very unwelcoming, and had my friends not been staying at the hotel too, I would have cancelled and booked elsewhere. Having spoken to my bank, I responded that there was no issue with the card they had on file, and requested they try again, which they did with no issues. A day later, they acknowledged my initial request. I feel they could have managed this in a more welcoming manner - if it was important for them to pre-authorise payment that early, given that my rate allowed me to cancel free of charge until the evening before arrival, they could have pointed it out and still acknowledge my request. In a way, I was being told that without a guarantee of payment, they would not consider any requests.All in all, this was a very good stay in Madrid. There is a vast choice of hotels in the city, and I would still consider the Indigo, but I would certainly look at other options before deciding.","December 16, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

271,"The Indigo brand has become my favourite in the IHG group as they are rapidly expanding the number of properties around the world. So when I was given a two day assignment in this area of Madrid it seemed like a good option. I was particularly taken by the line in the hotel's IHG Website PR; ""take a cooling dip in our rooftop infinity pool"" you just might expect to be able to do a few laps in the morning before starting work. Photos of said pool with a sunset background at the ""right angles"" looked far bigger than reality, it had me sold. Even better a few days before arrival I noted as a Spire member I had been upgraded to a suite.On check-in the supervisor apologised that my upgraded room had been sold you know how it is... well not really. But to make up they would give me the other suite for my second night. I explained I had an evening flight when I check out would it be possible to keep my room to just before 3pm (past the usual 2pm extension). He paused then agreed locked in I thought. First morning I headed to the pool which is part of their themed bar, with sunbeds and pool area down some steps for an early swim. No luck! Access via the bar does not open until 10am. So I go back a couple of hours later only to find a lone barman starting to set up. He says he will take me down as the changing room area was still locked. As I enter the area I trip on a raised door frame and the drop to the lower floor inside and fall flat on my face, quick reflexes limit my injury to a bruised hip and arm. In full view of the barman he is concern, and says it is a dangerous step and informs me a woman had broken her arm (or was it a leg) just a few weeks prior same spot... OK so NO SIGNS warning guests in any language or better still a ramp to avoid the drop. I mention it at the front desk to a couple of staff and nobody seems particularly concerned or aware of the woman's injury. As for the pool it is barely more than a plunge pool maybe 15m and is not heated so no more than 16C, so yes you will get ""a cooling dip"" as the sun does not hit the pool until the afternoon!My first room had no view other than the next building with limited natural light, the suite was spacious and comfortable but has no natural light whatsoever. The only highlight of the hotel for me is the sunset at the rooftop bar with some nice light food options to go with your drinks. I have waited until I returned home to write this review as I was too angry after checkout to give a fair appraisal. I landed at reception at 2:45pm to make my way to the airport. An inexperienced young lady on reception processed my account and advised me I had been charged fifteen Euros for my late checkout. I explained to her I had spoken with a supervisor when I arrived and he had approved the extension. She would have none of that and kept insisting on the payment. I asked to see the supervisor then the Duty manager until then she remained insistant. Around twenty years with IHG as a loyal member most in recent years at Spire level. The standard of staff (training) here is hit or mainly miss, especially if you don't speak Spanish. You are paying for the location.","November 23, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

275,Slightly mystified by this hotel’s rating. It’s OK but nothing special. Best bits are location and the excellent breakfast choice (though at €17 it should be good). Be aware that all the standard rooms face onto a very dark internal lightwell. The window also faces the bathroom so if you’re in bed it feels like you’re in a windowless cell! We asked to be moved as our first room on the 5th floor was so claustrophobic. They kindly moved us to the 9th floor which was a bit brighter as closer to the sky but still not great. Make sure you check out the Malasaña neighbourhood a couple of blocks north across Gran Via - lots of cool bars and cafes. ,"October 16, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

276,4 star boutique style hotel. Very modern and very clean. Staff eager to make sure you have all you need and that you’re happy with it. Rooftop bar has lovely view across the rooftops and good view of sunsets. Staff there really friendly. Had a great weekend (4nights) with hotel perfectly positioned in center of Madrid so you can reach any of places of interest easily. The only ‘average’ thing about the hotel was it’s food. Very unimaginative although quite tasty. ,"October 9, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

Unfortunately, the A/C was not working. We had to ""downgrade"" to another double room. They offered complimentary breakfast for our inconvenience. The upscale breakfast is a surprise beyond our expectation. Super close to subway stations for all attractions. Calle Gran Via is active day and night for tons of activies and eatery. The only down side was the consturction next door at the time we stayed.","September 26, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

278,"The only positive thing about this hotel is location and reception staff.Extremely disappointed with the hotel itself, the lifts are painfully slow, they only have 2 and you can wait 10minutes for a lift to arrive.The rooftop pool is poorly designed, most of the sun is blocked by a canapé.It was also closed 2 out of 3 evenings we were staying due to ‘private’ functions. This is Not good.They have a very small bar downstairs in the courtyard.There is also construction work next door.It feels like the hotel has been squeezed in between 2 buildings.This is our first and last stay.

It did tend to get busy though and some youngsters did hog the seating which was annoying.

On checking out we were able to leave our bags at the hotel and collect them later. The only complaint I would have is that we were in an internal room, which meant we had a window (not a balcony door) that looked out onto a very tall rough wall. This was not particularly a problem as we didn't spend much time in the room. I didn't realise we had booked an internal room, so this detail needs checking when you make a booking.

I did email a few times before my trip to request twin beds in our room, but we were given a double bed instead, although this wasn't a big issue.The room was clean and cosy, and had a mini bathroom, TV, fridge, arm chair, dressing table and free toiletries plus our towels were changed every other day. It took a while for our air-con to kick in but it was fine after that. Breakfast was good and there was lots of variety. There was cereal, a range of hot drinks, orange/ apple juice, yoghurts, pastries, mini pizza slices, fruit, ham and cheese board and baguettes. Location on Gran Via was brilliant too as it was similar to Oxford Street so it was nice and central. We were a little thrown off by the outside of the building but it is basically a big apartment block with a different hostel on each floor. There are loads of bars, restaurants and shops within walking distance of the hotel and also several metro stations. My favourite restaurant was 'Salvador Bachiller's greenhouse' which was in the basement of a retail shop a few doors down and IT WAS AMAZING!!Overall, if you're after cheap and cheerful accommodation in the centre of Madrid, then Vitium Urban Suites is definitely the place to go!","September 3, 2019","19    Vitium Urban Suites

They'll cook eggs for you and you actually had real coffee to drink. Of course, don't expect Grade A coffee, but it was fine if you're not picky. The location is walkable to the Palace/Church and Plaza Espana. Metro is close from a couple of different stops. Even though I think the hotel was near full (if not completely full) it was very quiet. Downsides? Elevator is small (seems like a lot of them are in Europe) and slow. As I mentioned the bathroom was small. The a/c was turned off for the season as it seems that the heat and the a/c can't run at the same time. Beware if you're going in the Spring or Fall. We had an incident where I spilled a glass of wine and it went everywhere on the bed. Since it was evening, there was no housekeeping and the guy at the front desk had to scramble to find a broom and new sheets/blankets for the bed, but he managed to do it so that was nice.","November 13, 2018","19    Vitium Urban Suites

I appreciate it is for security but it would be car easier if the card gave you acceess to the front door and each floor. Not a major issue just something that could be improved.

313,"Although Vitium Urban Suites is on the Gran Via, one of the main streets in Madrid, I think it's located just slightly too far northwest on the street to be entirely convenient. Closer to the metro stop Gran Via is a bit easier to get around. However, there are 2 metro stations very close (Santo Domingo & Plaza de Espana) and also tons of bars, restaurants, and shopping just outside the door.If you choose to take public transport from the airport, you can take the Cercanias rail to Chamartin, then transfer to the metro to Plaza de Espana. From there it's about a 5 minute walk.The building is currently (late March/ early April 2017) undergoing renovations. When you arrive at the hotel, the doorway is beneath scaffolding. It seemed the front door remained open during the day but then was locked at night, at which point you had to buzz to be let in. Although reception always buzzed you in promptly, I prefer locations where your keycard can also open the front door. Luckily there is an elevator, though small and slow. The door to the hotel itself is sometimes open or again sometimes you need to buzz.My room 511 did not face Gran Via but rather a smaller street behind it. However, the building opposite was undergoing construction, so it was a bit noisy when they began working in the morning. In addition, it faced several terraces, so if people are loud out on their terrace, you will hear it. Of course the hotel cannot control this but just be aware it may not be the quietest spot.The room was small but adequate; the bathroom was really tiny. A miniature sink and you practically touched the opposite wall while sitting on the toilet. The shower had good pressure and both a normal shower head and a rain shower (though I never did figure out how to use the rain shower). Both room and bathroom were clean and definitely looked new.Considering the size of the room, there was surprisingly decent storage space - a closet, several shelves, a large desk, and the top of the minibar. There was an easy to use safe in the closet. There was a sort of shelf along the wall behind the bed but no nightstand which would have been more convenient. Also no luggage rack.I did not use the minibar but it was well-stocked and not terribly expensive.The negative aspects: the wifi was terrible, constantly going in and out. I use roaming so I would start a Skype/ Whatsapp call anticipating using wifi, only to have it cut out at some point during the call and switch to data... be careful. And also, they twice did not bring me a new bathmat. I do not tend to reuse bathmats or towels and had in fact tossed the used, wet mat in the corner, only to discover when I returned to the room that they retrieved it. refolded it, and placed it back in the bathroom! That day they also did not bring me a fresh hand towel. I went to the desk and they were happy to give me a new mat and towel, but then the same thing happened the next day. This time when I went to the desk I was a little irritated and the man told me they only replace the bathmat every other day (though he did again give me a fresh one). This is super odd in a modern location such as this one when they do replace the rest of the towels daily.There were at least 4 people working at reception and some were friendlier than others, though all were helpful with buses, maps, etc.This is a okay choice if you get a great deal but I do not think I would seek out staying there again.","April 10, 2017","19    Vitium Urban Suites

The room was a good size and the décor stylish. The Reception staff were generally friendly and helpful. There is a small supermarket about 150 metres from the hotel (in an adjacent side street).The breakfast menu is reasonably extensive and typical of the Ibis chain generally; the staff in the dining room were friendly and helpful.

Right in the heart ofSol, and walking distance to practically all the sights, Plaza Mayor, Museo del Prado, Puerta del Sol (obviamente), Gran Vía etc. I always book a room facing the street. Room is pretty in green and white. Good size, nice window, everything functional. And I don’t mind some noise of my dear tapas trail lovers since it’s a street facing room. It’s Madrid. It has life! Breakfast is perfect, you get what you pay for. Nothing bad, nothing exceptional. Beds are super comfortable! Air con works perfectly fine. Heating is great too, in winters. Front desk is great. Service is top quality. They store luggage too. The selling points of this hotel are location, service and functionality of the rooms. And it has laundry nearby. Just step out of the hotel, turn left, and walk on Calle de Leon, you will find Lavandería. Drop of your laundry and they will wash, dry and fold: and keep your bundle of clothes ready, nice and fresh for you. I use it each time and they are amazing. They dry clean too. Supermarkets, kiosks, pharmacies, restaurants... basically everything nearby. There is so much to do in Madrid, I don’t need a posh place to waste my time in a hotel.

324,"The hotel is a relatively small boutique hotel in a quiet neighbourhood. We found the service to be very good with a helpful concierge and front desk. They recommended an excellent restaurant a short walk from the hotel and also gave us a discounted late check out as we were not departing for the airport until 8pm. Many other hotels would have stuck to the full over night stay charge despite there being an empty room!The breakfast was good with enough variety and everything was fresh.We were in a Classic Double room which wasn't huge but just large enough. To make the best use of the space you walk through the wardrobe and bathroom space to get to the bedroom. A little different but a good use of space. We were on the 2nd floor off a main road and we were not affected by noise. Beds were firm and comfy.Whilst we didn't find this a downside it is a bit of a walk or a taxi ride to the main tourist spots. We walked to the Retiro and Plaza Major with the odd stop off at a few markets (recommended by the concierge) before walking back to the hotel and we clocked it at 15km.If coming back to Madrid, I would stay here again.","December 24, 2019","36    Relais & Chateaux Heritage Madrid Hotel

332,"We stayed in hotel Heritage for one night, on our way back from vacation on the Costa del Sol.In the past, we have never stayed in Madrid mainly because we were afraid of traffic inside the city but also because of a lack of high-end hotels at a reasonable price.Hotel Heritage proved us wrong and we will certainly return.First of all, the welcome was fantastic. We were travelling with my father who is both very old and has trouble walking (stairs are impossible). The personnel did everyting they could to help my father out of the car and into his room as fast and comfortably as possible. There are2 different entries to the hotel, but each of them offers an elevator so we could easily avoid the stairs. The personnelcouldn't be more helpful and friendly than they were.Our 2 rooms (we were 4) were very spacious and had everything we could hope for. Bath and separate shower, separate toilet, small lounge with 2 comfortable chairs, complimentary bottle of water, bathrobes, slippers,...We are regular visitors of Relais & Chateaux hotels all over Europe, so yes a lot of these things are common but the size of the rooms, the design (""vieux chic"") and the fact that there was absolutely nothing to make a remark about, really made this hotel stand out.In the evening, we had a great meal in the hotel restaurant, again with very nice personnel and a perfect maitre d'hötel who made excellent suggestions.It was less important for us, but the hotel is also very nicely located if you want to visit the city: not very far from the big museums and the most important shopping area.","October 4, 2019","36    Relais & Chateaux Heritage Madrid Hotel

333,This is probably one of my best hostel experiences. Fist of all. They don’t have bunk beds. Which is a nice change. The area is very touristy but it’s very convenient to everything. Staff was friendly and helpful. They have laundry and the place is kept clean. There are shared showers but each have their own room. So you have more privacy that the dorm style showers. There is free churros and chocolate every morning. It’s worth waking up for! Also free dinner is available every evening. Which I was unable to go to. But is great if you are alone or want to save money. I went on the free tour to Segovia. Tour guide was great. All we paid was the metro and bus ticket. And when we got there they showed us a cheap spot to eat. They also have other things to do. There is a pub tour and other free tours. In general they go out of your way to make you feel welcome. If you are traveling alone and especially if you are not the best social person this is the place to stay in Madrid. ,"October 6, 2019","37    Sungate One Hostel

336,"I stayed at Sungate One as a solo traveller for 3 nights in early May 2019. It was easy to access and incredibly central (please don't buy a tourist metro pass! I did but never used it as the hostel is in walking distance to everything). The hostel staff are amazingly helpful, and provide free dinner and breakfast (and not just any breakfast, we're talking churros and cake!) with the option to pop a few coins in a tip jar. The atmosphere in the common dining area is great, and an easy way to make friends. There is the opportunity to participate in drinking games and going out, but if that's not for you it's still easy to get a decent night's sleep without being disturbed. The place is incredibly clean and well maintained (and I say that as a bit of a neat freak). The only issue I had was with the quality of the beds - the lack of bunk beds was fantastic, don't get me wrong, but mine seemed to allow me to feel every single spring inside it, and all of them wanted to dig deep into my flesh. The pillow was also pretty pathetic. I certainly don't expect five star comfort at a hostel, but this was out of character for the place given how good it is otherwise. Despite the bed issue, I would 100% recommend Sungate One to other travellers, particularly solo. For the older age group, don't be put off! There were several solo female travellers in their 50/60's staying at the time, interspersed among the 20 year olds.","May 5, 2019","37    Sungate One Hostel

The room was ok, but much smaller than pictured when we booked, and the window opened to an alley directly facing a bleak wall - very depressing and dark!

It's also much cheaper than most central Madrid accommodation, and you know you're getting a good standard.The only reason I can't award it 5 stars is because the rooms are still somewhat lacking - no safe's in the room, TV could only pick up a handful of channels and the air-con struggles if the temperature outside goes above 30. It's a two minute walk down the road from a good selection of local cafe's and restaurants, as well as a few burger places.Don't let any of the above put you off though - the staff were brilliant, the rooms were kept spotless.

We stayed in a superior room last time, which had a seating area next to the tv and a raised platform with seating next to the window.This year we decided to book one of the penthouse rooms with an outdoor terrace/patio expecting it to be as large as the room we had last year, we were wrong.On entering, the room was a weird shape, narrow entrance hall, straight into the desk area. There was a huge pillar in the centre of the room and there was very little room either side of the bed. The terrace though was brilliant! Large and quite private, with two chairs and a table. We loved the view over the city and las ventas. We were here during the heatwave in mid to late June.....the air con system just could not cope so we took matters into our own hands and purchased a room fan from the shop next door, €15 we didn’t have to spend but it made sleeping a lot easier!There are no tea/coffee facilities in these rooms so take a travel kettle! This led to another problem with the room, only one plug socket, under the desk. Annoying to the modern traveller, when you have phones and cameras to charge!The staff are really friendly here and our room was serviced daily to a good standard. Location is ok with a metro stop opposite and plenty of restaurants nearby. If you don’t want to stay in the thick of the tourist hotspots, this is your place! This is also reflected in the price, as it is much cheaper than other ibis/Accor hotels in Madrid city centre.","October 2, 2019","27    ibis Madrid Centro Las Ventas

352,"My wife and I had a wonderful six night stay at the H10 Villa de La Reina recently. Immediately upon our arrival, we were greeted by the desk staff and offered a glass of sparkling wine as we checked in. The experience at the desk set the tone for the rest of our stay. During our stay, the desk staff never failed to say good morning every day and have a good day as we left and welcome back, when we returned to the hotel. Pablo was especially helpful at the desk, going above and beyond to be helpful. Our experience at the front desk extended to the other areas of the hotel. Our room was clean and nicely decorated.The bed was very comfortable and the sheets and blankets smelled fresh and clean. The breakfast was superb. Fresh cooked eggs, a good selection of fresh fruit and juices and several types of meats were available. Fran made sure that a basket of fresh rolls and croissants were on your table as soon as you were seated. The lounge/bar area was a very comfortable place to end the day and enjoy a drink. I was unfamiliar with the various vermouth served in Spain and was surprised to see that the bar had Yzaguirre Vermouth on tap. Geena offered me a sample and I became an immediate convert. What a great location to sit and relax, sip a vermouth and unwind. Another important part of the hotel is its central location. It is a short walk to most sights in central Madrid. We never needed a taxi to get around to see the sights. We had such a pleasant stay that we have already made plans to return to the H10 Villa de La Reina. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking in downtown Madrid for a great place to stay.","December 2, 2019","39    H10 Villa de la Reina Boutique Hotel

353,"This hotel has an old-school charm. Very nice main lobby with bar area for relaxing. Our room was a moderate size with a good size bathroom with a nice shower. There were 2 closets, but no chests for clothing. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. There were also no windows. The staff was pleasant and helpful. They have a very nice breakfast area on the lower level, that served a yummy and hearty assortment of items each morning. We walked all over the city, seeing the sites (our first visit to Madrid), but getting a taxi was easy as well. Gran Via is a VERY busy street, full of shopping and restaurants. The sidewalks are always mobbed. We enjoyed walking in the neighborhood behind the hotel, which was much less crowded, but still had shopping and restaurants. We stayed 4 nights.","November 10, 2019","39    H10 Villa de la Reina Boutique Hotel

We stayed in room 602 - top floor with a balcony and it was lovely. The housekeeping was also done very well. When we originally booked they could not supply us with the champagne we like (it was our wedding anniversary) however they contacted my wife months later as they had a new supplier and organised the champagne for us.

355,"Hotel is clean and bed comfortable. However, I did not like this hotel. It is located in Gran Via and it was so overwhelmingly crowded. I also found the hallways very dark. It had no windows. Carpeting was black and lower portion of hallway walls were painted in black. They also used energy saver lighting which did not help at all. I felt that this made the hotel feel like a budget hotel. Breakfast was also a disappointment. Bacon was sitting in a lot of grease and eggs looked wet. They had Churros but no chocolate. Pastries tasted like they were purchased from a cheap supermarket. I ordered an omelette and it took them about 25 min to bring it out. I kindly asked them to follow up on it a couple of times and each time they said it was coming. When it finally came, it was so salty that I couldn’t really eat it. Housekeeping also made a lot of noise outside our room at 7:45 on Saturday morning so we could not really sleep in. All in all, not a very pleasant stay.","November 3, 2019","39    H10 Villa de la Reina Boutique Hotel

It had a window to the small inner court and thus didn't have any noise from the street. The interior wasbeautiful in a classical style, with all modern amenities in the bathroom.

The breakfast room is beautiful and provides a variety of breakfast items (cooked, continental, pastries, fruits, yoghurts etc..) The staff are friendly and we particularly liked Javier on reception. The location in my opinion was on the better end of the gran via. My only downside would be that we had what I would deem to be an Internal room - but given the reviews on noise from the gran via - perhaps this wasn’t a bad thing!

359,"We picked this as it is in between the museums and the Royal Palace. It is a refuge from the busy Gran Via. It has been modernize but still keeping some local color which we loved. The furnishings have been thought out well, except for two things in our room. Our window and there are two (one in the bathroom) are frosted since it faces the courtyard/air shaft and across the other 2 rooms. Although it was comfortable it could be claustrophobic after a couple of days. Another thing is that we were placed next to the maids closet. So it could be noisy during siesta. Lastly the signature artpiece in our room is forced into a corner when the facing wide wall is empty. It is a lovely hotel but we have to get a different room next time.

The cleaning service must know the they cannot throw away people stuff. Please note this. Also my room mate told that she lost her tooth paste, and maybe it got “cleaned” by the cleaning service staff.Also the room is not everyday get cleaned.

369,"The hotel is a relatively small boutique hotel in a quiet neighbourhood. We found the service to be very good with a helpful concierge and front desk. They recommended an excellent restaurant a short walk from the hotel and also gave us a discounted late check out as we were not departing for the airport until 8pm. Many other hotels would have stuck to the full over night stay charge despite there being an empty room!The breakfast was good with enough variety and everything was fresh.We were in a Classic Double room which wasn't huge but just large enough. To make the best use of the space you walk through the wardrobe and bathroom space to get to the bedroom. A little different but a good use of space. We were on the 2nd floor off a main road and we were not affected by noise. Beds were firm and comfy.Whilst we didn't find this a downside it is a bit of a walk or a taxi ride to the main tourist spots. We walked to the Retiro and Plaza Major with the odd stop off at a few markets (recommended by the concierge) before walking back to the hotel and we clocked it at 15km.If coming back to Madrid, I would stay here again.","December 24, 2019","36    Relais & Chateaux Heritage Madrid Hotel

386,"We visited Madrid for a long weekend in October and chose this hotel based on it's location and quality of reviews. We were not disappointed, the hotel is in a perfect location to walk to almost all of Madrid's attractions. Booking into a superior room (712), we were pleasantly surprised with how clean and high quality the room was (the bed was extremely comfy and the shower was brilliant). Check in process was very quick and easy with all staff being friendly making us feel welcome. Yes the room was a little small, but it's completely fine for a couple staying for for 3 nights. After checking in we visited the sky bar on the 9th floor which we ended up visiting more than we expected due to how good it was! Overall a really great hotel which we would book again in an instant if visiting Madrid. Didn't have the breakfast as €24pp seemed quite expensive.","October 10, 2019","42    NH Collection Madrid Gran Via

388,"We were on the fifth floor, in a studio with a lounge/diner/kitchenette with bathroom, and bedroom on a mezzanine level. Opposite the palace and next door to the wonderful Cafe de Oriente, this was the perfect location from which to explore beautiful Madrid, whilst also being very quiet. The building is old and sympathetically updated, with period looking furniture and ornaments, whilst also offering all the modern comforts like heating, aircon and a fabulous shower. The kitchenette offered microwave, fridge, oven & hob, along with a kettle, tea & coffee. A lovely touch was the Cava in the fridge and bottle of red wine on the side, laid out with suitable glasses on arrival, very welcoming. The staff were fabulously friendly and helpful, offering great advice of where to visit, which we took and had a lovely time. The only negative word we’d have is we found the bed and pillows (only one pillow each) very hard and comfortless, so unfortunately we did not sleep well. Otherwise, it was absolutely lovely.","November 30, 2019","43    Oriente Palace Apartments

But the minute you walk in into a small lobby, you will be Immediately welcomed by Mihaela. Spend a few minutes after checking in with her as she has a wealth of info on where to go in Madrid. When we got to our room or apartment, we were so surprised at how big it was. It was literally a one bedroom apartment with a living room and a full service kitchen. Some reviews complained about the noise but it was not an issue for us. It is truly a home away from home. When we go back to Madrid and I hope it is real soon, I would stay again at the Oriente Palace Apartments. Thank you Mihaela and Alex. You made our stay an experience we will never forget.

390,"We stayed here for a first visit to Madrid on a 4 night break. The hotel is charming- lots of character the reception staff were great. Mihaela in particular couldn’t have been more helpful and spoke great English.There were two negatives to an otherwise lovely stay here. One is noise and the other is the breakfast arrangements. We encountered quite a lot of noise from the rooms above as the floors here are all a very attractive polished wood but they are are very creaky. The ceiling is exposed beams which again adds to the charm and character of the room but consequently there is probably limited soundproofing. I’d suggest booking a top floor apartment which would avoid being subjected to this aspect of noise. We chose a balcony room facing the palace which had great views but did prove noisy at night. I would recommend booking a rear facing room - which is probably cheaper too!The breakfast arrangements we had were vouchers that we could use at Oriente Palace Cafe just around the corner. It’s important to state the cafe is not owned by the Oriente Apartments and they have no direct control over them. We found the staff there unhelpful and offhand - especially when they saw we had vouchers from the hotel. The food the vouchers provided was very limited and on two occasions we purchased additional food - on one morning I ordered one croissant in addition to a small toasted roll with a portion of jam and I then got charged for the croissant! On the 4th morning we gave up and bought breakfast elsewhere. I would definitely recommend the hotel for its great location, character and lovely staff. If you’d be disturbed by the type of noise I mention be specific about booking your room and avoid Oriente Palace Cafe!","May 23, 2019","43    Oriente Palace Apartments

394,"We wanted to love this property. The location is fabulous but difficult to find. The front desk person was charming and helpful. The room was clean and functional, large by European standards. The bathroom was excellent.The location on Oriente Plaza has benefits and drawbacks. It isn’t a difficult walk to numerous attractions including El Prado. Unfortunately, the plaza never sleeps. While we enjoyed the view, the open window (necessary to keep the room from stifling heat) allowed every noise to enter. Even when we broke down and closed the windows, there were epic bouts of dog barking, the emptying of nearby dumpsters (likely recycling since the sound was of 10,000 glass bottles), the disco music which did not come from the plaza but somewhere within the building. The “bump-bump-bump” of the bass line continued until after 3 a.m. Oh, and the playground full of screaming children (and I mean screaming) punctuated the day.We didn’t mind the old mechanical locks or the tiny lift. We didn’t mind the three keys necessary to access our room or the comfort of the bed. I normally don’t review beds or pillow since those preferences are highly personal, however, the pillows just didn’t work for me.This is a lovely old property in a grand location and a tremendous value. For us, however, it was just too noisy.","February 19, 2019","43    Oriente Palace Apartments

395,"We chose this hotel for our 4-night stay in Madrid for our first wedding anniversary and we absolutely loved it. First of all it is in a fantastic location with a great view of the palace and is very central within walking distance of all the main streets, and only 2 minutes away from the Opera metro station for going further afield. Secondly the staff, especially Mihaela, are super friendly and amazingly helpful, you are greeted with a smile and a 'hello' every time you come in. The room itself was beautifully decorated and was always nice and cosy which you need in February!There were a couple of little niggles which are the only reason I haven't given 5 stars:- The pillows are basically blocks of foam which may suit some people but we personally found them very uncomfortable and too hard, we ended up sleeping on the little decorative cushions instead which were much comfier!- One for the ladies: There was a nice big mirror on the wall but no plug socket near it or any surface for putting make-up/hair straighteners etc on so getting ready in the morning was a bit of a struggle. There is a plug socket next to the bathroom mirror but the bathroom is quite small so it's not really the ideal space- Being in such a central location, it does get very noisy in the street and never seems to really get quiet, so if you are a light sleeper this may not be the hotel for you - the walls of the hotel are also quite thin and squeaky floorboards being an old buildingOverall though, we loved our stay, and if we ever return to Madrid we would definitely stay here again.

My room Also lacked any WiFi, which while a small inconvenience was a little annoying. During my stay, Madrid suffered a heat wave which the AC wasn't prepared for, this meant the rooms were a constant 32°C.

422,"THIS IS MY OPINION of my stay at Hotel Ganivet, Madrid, Spain in late September for 2 nights in room 408, a triple room with breakfast included. I reserved the room on Agoda.com for a total of 579 euros, taxes included, about 2 weeks before our stay. We were very pleased with the hotel & staff and would stay again. This is one of the nicer 3-star hotels we have stayed.The hotel is in the fun La Latina section of Madrid set between two close metro stops that made it easy to get around the city. The front desk staff spoke English on every shift and the lobby itself is plain with a few couches. There are full length windows looking out onto Calle de Toledo. At check-in we were given the choice of a street-facing or internal facing room, I chose street.Our room, 408, was a triple with 3 single beds squeezed tightly into the small room with just enough space to walk around. We had a desk, smaller flat screen TV, large wardrobe, a room safe (no charge +++), blackout curtains and nice lighting. The beds were comfortable but firm and there were extra blankets & pillows in the wardrobe. Surprisingly and happily, we didn’t hear anything from the street with the windows closed even though buses and cars are passing all day and night. The TV has a few English channels. Maid service was excellent so I didn’t hesitate to tip a few euros. No iron or ironing board. A kettle or coffee maker; not sure if there was one but we used the desk for our suitcase stand so can’t remember. I did not notice a refrigerator or mini-bar. One final room note, the air conditioner had its own controls and it worked flawlessly & super quiet! The bathroom was well lit with a toilet, shower and tub. The large sink had basic amenities like small soaps, shampoo and shower cap. The bonus here was real glass glasses, not plastic cups. Not a spec of mold/mildew and water pressure was good with lots of hot water! A soak in the tub after tons of sightseeing was very welcomed.Hotel décor is standard & two modern elevators were quick to come. Wifi worked well with no complaints. We didn’t see any computers/Printers but we didn’t need them. There is a little café off the lobby that makes good coffee. On the top floor is a large whirlpool/pool. We didn’t realize it was there until the last day so we didn’t use it. It’s a nice roof deck with relaxing chairs and a bathroom. We were sad we didn’t know about it. It also has a great few of the south side of Madrid.The only downside of our stay was the included breakfast. We only used it 1 of the 2 mornings so I can only judge on using it once. We overslept the 2nd day and missed the 10:30 closing time. We gave it a grade of C mostly due to the fact we didn’t like the coffee, we felt the fruit juices were odd tasting and they barely cooked the bacon which was not crisp. The fruit and ham/cheese selection was nice. If we returned and had our choice to reserve without it we would skip it and eat elsewhere. One final note about the Hotel Ganivet’s great staff. We brought our own pillows from home. When we checked out we forgot them in the room. However, we were still in Madrid and went back to get them and they said they would look for the pillows. We returned the next day and not only did they find them, but they washed and put them in plastic bags for us. Kudos!!Yes, we recommend this hotel.","October 8, 2019","46    Ganivet Hotel

424,"We were really impressed with the staff. They are very friendly and helpful. We were able to check in much earlier than the normal check in time and it was really appreciated as we just spent 22 hours flight. The apartment was very clean and equipped with complete amenities. It was raining everday when we were at Madrid, so having a complete kitchen set was really helpful as we were able to cook simple meals for dinner (there is a carrefour express next to the hotel). The hotel is also well located near tourist attractions and shopping streets. We were able to walk everywhere. And there are many restaurants nearby. The one next door was suggested by the receptionist but unfortunately we weren’t able to try it as it was always very crowded. ","December 22, 2019","47    11th Principe by Splendom Suites

426,"Bag stolen from this hotel luggage storageThis happened in a family holiday in Madrid. After check-out, we asked to leave our bags in the hotel luggage storage while we went on a last walk around the area. After 2 hours we returned and asked for our bags back, but one of them could not be found. We filled a police report and travelled back home.When we left the bags in the hotel we were given a ticket/receipt, so there was no doubt that the bag was in fact received by the hotel staff. The police investigation did not produce a conclusive result of what happened (the security cameras weren´t operational, and no one in the staff remembers seeing anything out of the ordinary).We made a written complaint to the hotel and requested compensation for the loss of the bag. After a few exchanged emails with the hotel management, they simply stopped responding without ever given an answer to our request. I could understand if they had refused to pay claiming some legal reason (that I could not prove the contents of the bag, for example), but their attitude towards the problem was simple to ignore it and stop all communications. I’m a foreign citizen so the trouble of pursuing legal action isn’t worth the value lost with the theft of the bag. So, in conclusion, beware of this hotel as its management culture may not be focus toward solving customer problems or assuming responsibilities…","November 19, 2019","47    11th Principe by Splendom Suites

I was given a quiet room as requested because i need a good night's sleep after a long flight. My suite room came with a kitchenette, living room, spacious and clean bathroom and a very sizeable bedroom. The rooms are well cleaned and the air-cond works very well. They provide frew coffee, muffin and cereal at the lobby. The only that was not working so well for me was the wifi. It seems that 2 of their routers were blown so wifi was very spotty and weak. This is easily repaired so i am sure it will be ok in the future. There's a supermarket about 10 steps away and plenty of restaurants and cafe to choose from.

For someone who'd never been to Madrid before, it was easy to walk around from here to explore the gorgeous architecture and sample great food. The rooms worked well - we had a duplex suite which very comfortably accommodated all four of us, and as a bonus had a lovely verandah allowing us to soak in the twilight. Also, the suite had a galley kitchen which could be handy. A Hotel can live or die by its staff - they couldn't have been friendlier.

Alejandro made us really feel like valuable customers, patiently answering our questions on Madrid, but also suggesting activities. Knowing that we had an early flight outt he offered a packed breakfast for each of us that we took with us to the airport. We picked this property because of his closeness to the airport. The hotel provides shuttle services to the airport and to downtown Madrid. Alvaro, from the Guest Relations desk was also very helpful and courteous.

435,"I am a Marriott Titanium Member and I stay at a lot of Marriott Hotels for work and pleasure. Let me say, this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. I was in Madrid for 2 nights before flying to Barcelona for 2 nights, and then returned to Madrid for 2 nights. Thus, I decided to stay at a hotel near the airport. I am happy I did, because let me give you all the reasons this hotel is wonderful.I used my suites night certificates for both stays, and the upgraded room was wonderful. The refrigerator in the room was stocked with some drinks, which were free/complimentary in my upgraded room. The suite was wonderful compared to other hotels I have been at, where the suite room is not much better than the normal room.I was a Titanium member so the hotel left a gift of some delicious biscuit/cookies in my room, which was delicious.The executive lounge was wonderful and had delicious food. It was open from 6:00 in the morning to midnight every day, which is great and provides plenty of options regardless of when your flights gets in. The food in the lounge was wonderful, high quality, with smoked salmon, desserts, and with free drinks. It is honestly one of the best Executive Lounges I have ever been in. The lounge attendant asks for your room number when you first walk in to confirm that you can use the Executive Lounge, which was a bit confusing for someone not used to it because in the USA you just scan your keycard and walk in. However, this is understandable and after the first time they will recognize you for following lounge visits.As a Marriott Titanium member, you can also have breakfast at the buffet on the lobby floor, which has similar food but some more options.The hotel has an ATM in the lobby which is very convenient for travelers.There is a line of taxis outside the hotel, and also a free shuttle bus to the Madrid airport. From the airport, you can catch a train to the Madrid city center. There is also a free shuttle to a shopping mall near the hotel.My only tip to management is to find some way to make the shuttle schedule more easy to find on the website. I have included a picture of it, but it would be helpful to know ahead to time so that I can see whether I should rush to catch it after my airplane lands.Overall, the hotel is a great value, and I will be staying here next time I am in Madrid. The amenities and service was wonderful, and it is one of the best hotels I live ever stayed at. I highly recommend this hotel.","December 7, 2019","48    Madrid Marriott Auditorium Hotel & Conference ...

The executive lounge hours are 6:30 to 12:30 AM. The alcohol starts and 1 PM and runs until close. The lounge has good food all day and dinner from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM. We ate our meals in the executive lounge. We did not see any restaurants within walking distance. The hotel offers a free shuttle to/from the mall. Also, the hotel is only 30 minutes from downtown Madrid. You can catch the bus right outside the hotel and have a quick transfer to the underground….and you are downtown. Everything was easy. From check-in to round trip shuttle to/from the airport.

441,"I normally get my first impression of the hotel when I send emails inquiring about booking. Their prompt replies and feedback to my queries already gave an insight that the way they deal with their patrons is very professional. In fact we ended up arriving late as we had a delay, and when I sent an email to inform the hotel, they replied to my email immediately. When we finally arrived after a three hour delay, we were warmly greeted by Yadian at the reception. He was so helpful going through various things and giving us tips not only on the day, but throughout the whole week we stayed there. Our room was on the top floor as I had requested, it was a nice spacious airy room, with a good sized bathroom and kitchenette . I was surprised how well insulated the rooms were as we did not hear any noise providing us with restful nights. The room was very spacious and immaculately clean as was the bathroom. I was surprised to say the truth with the items provided for example the hairdryer. Such a simple thing but personally I find it's a nightmare to blowdry my hair with the ones usually provided. Their attention to detail and needs of their guests left me quite astounded. Breakfast was delicious too and the staff were really nice. Also the terrace has a breathtaking view of the palace. It was a pity that we visited in December as it would have been nice to sit there and have a drink, but it was too cold in the evenings to stay for more than a few minutes. The hotel is equidistant to two metro stops - Plaza Espana and Principe Pio. This was another plus, apart from the fact of having bus stops just a few steps away from the hotel. Also it's a few metres away from the Royal Palace and walking distance to most of the sights.I would not like to mention names, as I don't want to leave out anyone, but all the staff are so friendly and professional in their approach. You are always greeted with a smile and very helpful in every way. Thanks to everyone for making our short break a memorable and relaxing one. Should we revisit Madrid, obviously we would not even consider looking around anywhere else.","December 22, 2019","1     ApartoSuites Jardines de Sabatini

The hotel also comes with a communal kitchen which is available 24/7 and provides coffee from a coffee machine, tea, juices, water, fresh fruit, a microwave and ice etc. It is a very welcome free service. There is a free breakfast pack left at the door each morning which contains croissants, muffins and water. The bed is huge and very comfortable and the shower has a rainwater shower head, great pressure and easy to regulate temperature. There is free parking at the rear of the hotel and free reliable wi-fi. We would stay here again and would recommend to family and friends.","August 12, 2019","8     B&B Hotel Madrid Centro Puerta del Sol

Despite being on the Main Street next to a metro station, you could not hear much traffic at night apart from the occasional sirens. Very helpful staff and very informative. The room was very clean and stylish. The only small issue we had was that our room was on floor 11 and the lift sometimes took up to 3 minutes to get to our floor as it was quite slow especially if other people were using it.

The room decor was simple but very comfortable, shower was very good! Air conditioning was so-so, couldn't adjust it.Front desk staff not very engaging. I asked for a taxi to get to the airport in the early morning, they tried calling the taxi service once and then apologized they didn't answer and told me to stand on the street...No taxi's came in 15 minutes so I requested an Uber.I didn’t like that you don’t truly get a breakfast even though the property is called B&B. You get a bag delivered to your door daily with the same items, croissant, lemon muffin and one water-even though we were 2 guests we only got one water per person however we did get 2 of each mini pastry daily. If you want coffee to go with it, you need to go to the 5th floor to get it. Coffee, tea and juices available all day on the 5th floor.

We could easily walk on a side street to the interesting university district with restaurants, shops and markets. And the San Miguel Market isn’t too far away. The Tribunal metro stop is only about 10 minutes walk from this hotel.We also appreciate that this is the first hotel chain in Spain that has removed all of the disposable plastic in its rooms.

477,"Every aspect of my stay was a step above and beyond what was necessary. I truly was sad to check out! Fabulous hotel located in the heart of central Madrid on the very popular Calle Gran Via. Front reception staff was actually friendly (hard to find in Madrid) who helped me get checked in.The lady also gave me a helpful map and pointed out where the 2 museums were that I wanted to visit. I arrived a bit early but it wasn’t a problem at all and I was able to have access to my room right away. My room was practical yet stylish. I loved the floor to ceiling mirror that also doubled as the bathroom door. As is common in Europe, the room card must be placed in the slot by the door for the electricity to work. In the bathroom, there was a narrow counter above the sink to place toiletries. There was a magnifying mirror next to the sink which was very much appreciated. The 1/2 glass shower door meant that the bath water did not spill out onto the floor. The drain worked well. There was a placard with instructions to work the shower however it made no sense at all and unfortunately was not helpful at all. The shower seemed to have one temperature, which was hotter than I cared for, a rarity in Europe where most often the problem seems to be the inability to get hot water. I appreciated the amenities that were provided, shower gel, shampoo, LOTION(!), a shower camp and a sponge. The shower drained well. Electrical outlets on both side of the bed were very convenient. The only possible drawback was that my room faced Calle Gran Via and was pretty noisy. I slept fine but others might find it a problem. There was a rooftop patio that explored one night but it was closed (December) while I was there","December 25, 2019","53    Vincci The Mint

We paid for the included breakfast and it was excellent. Instead of a buffet or a buffet combined with hot order, you simply order what you wanted from the expansive menu (everything from an Iberian ham platter to a cheese tray to yogurt and muesli to eggs, waffles, etc.) - the food was uniformly delicious and the wait staff (shout out to Alejandro) was so friendly. They even had soy milk for my dairy-sensitive daughter. We could not have been happier. In the rooms, the beds were very comfortable (they provided a third bed for my daughter instead of the pull-out couch that is customary in Europe triples and less comfortable) and it was behind a partial wall for some privacy. The bathroom was very spacious (especially by European standards) with double sinks, a towel warmer, and a tub shower with consistently good pressure and temperature control. The mini bar items were reasonably priced, there were ample outlets for our devices, and there were individual adjustable lamps beside the double bed. Extra touches: they left a typewritten multi-page list of the neighborhoods in Madrid and the activities, sites, favorite staff restaurants in each one. There is a gorgeous rooftop bar; however, it was too cold to enjoy that during our visit. There are tons of great restaurants within yards of the restaurant and the hotel is less than a 15 minute walk to the popular Puerto de Sol. Taxis are plentiful right outside the hotel door.

It was nice to hear the street performers singing and playing music. When the door was closed we didn’t hear anything so it was great. This hotel is in the perfect spot for visiting Madrid.

500,"I booked this Hotel online for a long weekend. It was not my first choice and was less expensive than I was prepared to pay. I had some reservations, as I was concerned from some of the pictures I saw online that it may be a little faded in its appearance, but I need not have worried. I arrived three hours before check-in hoping they would be happy to hold my luggage while I went in search of lunch. The staff at reception were most welcoming and spoke perfect English. Without me asking, they checked my reservation and found my room was ready. The room itself exceeded all my expectations. It was vast, clean, very well appointed and had a huge bathroom. The bathroom is worth a special mention, because the shower is without doubt THE finest shower I have ever experienced in any hotel anywhere in the world. The bathroom was palatial, with bidet and two sinks, a massive shower and an equally sized bath. The bedroom was similarly well appointed, the bed and bed linen perfect, there was an ironing board and iron, a safe, a minibar, all the usual things you find in a hotel room, but everything was of excellent quality. I have stayed in many hotels all over the world, over the last forty years but this ranks as good as the very best. I would not consider staying anywhere else in Madrid on my next visit. The hotel staff were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble. The location is also superb for a stay in the city. ","October 18, 2019","55    Hotel Atlantico

Prince, Almudena, Giulia and David welcomed us, gave us advice and said goodbye as if we were close for life. The reception in the hands of Isabel, Anabel and Sara was an absolute attention to any detail that we might need to have a more comfortable stay. The room service is impeccable, detailed and tidy. In the Lobo 8 restaurant we were lucky enough to be recommended by Chef Angelo and pastry chef Sergio, who would define the gastronomic concept as modern, personal, high quality and careful with the product. The restaurant service was very professional for the detailed description of each of the elaborations that served us as well as the concern for food intolerances. Alejandro, Raul, María and Marta serve you at breakfast and in the restaurant as pure lovers of their trade, they transmit their love for what they do. Lobbyto Cocktail Bar is the space of the lobby of the hotel converted into a spectacular cocktail of the 20s United States at a price more than fair for the quality of the signature cocktails of the hand of Mike and Fabri.Finally I prefer that you experience on your own the comfort, quality and luxury of the rooms and each of the details that are throughout the hotel.

It was a nice touch.When we told the manager how fabulous one of the concierge staff was (she got the Netflix adapter working and helped us watch TV in English), they later sent up two bottles of Coke Light, our beverage of choice with two glasses of ice.

All the basics hotel needs are there and our room was very spacious and enough electricity outlets.The only thing we didn't really like was the bed, as it was a queen size single mattress. My gf and I prefer to sleep in the same doubel bed but on separate single mattresses. Also, don't expect things to be in tiptop shape. The interior design and furniture are a bit dated and here and there worn down. These little things don't affect comfort but prevent me from giving this hotel 5 stars. For Spanish standards breakfast was very nice, with a great assortment of food and drink options. For northern european standards breakfast was a bit basic.Staff was very nice though and helped us with printing our boarding passes.Location is also excellent with free street parking, not a lot of traffic noise, and close proximity to metro/subway station and shopping mall.","August 15, 2019","57    Silken Torre Garden

518,"The Silken Torre Garden is still a good hotel, even if signs are everywhere, that a refurbishing would be very welcomed. For us, the main attraction is its location. When our flight arrives in Madrid, where we spend only one night before with the hired car we start to explore Spain; Silken Torre Garden is an excellent choice to avoid the traffic of the city center. Their breakfast is nothing special, but with their offers, everyone can have a decent meal. For me, the breakfast is called a good one, if I can have Pan con Tomate- Tostada di Tomato. A few years ago I fell in love with it, when we visited Spain, and it is still one of my favorites. The hotel has spacious rooms, a decorative foyer, but the wind of decay is swirling everywhere. If your eyesight isn't sharp anymore, or if you aren't examine everything with critical eyes, probably you can be fully and foolishly satisfied. For example, maybe you don't notice, or, don't care about the good quality, but already greyish towels, the rotting bottom of the bathroom door, or the patches on the carpet. We can say that all these are just a flaw in beauty and do not affect the comfort of travelers, which is partly true because otherwise, we would have chosen a different hotel. Still sad to see, maybe, because of a lack of money or negligence, they leave a high standard hotel to go down. I hope that next year if we drop in again, this accommodation will shine in its old light.The staff is nice, courteous, and there is - or at least during our visits it was - a free of charge unlimited time parking on the street.

After staying in over 5 hotels in Spain , one 3 times the price and a 5 star .. the Principal is our favourite , demonstrating bigger and more expensive isn’t better. While it’s small , the junior suite was the largest thus far. The service is what sets this elegant hotel apart. As avid travellers , it was one of our top 10 in the world. Right from check in , to their stunning patio and restaurant food , to the airport transportation . Each and every member of their staff were not only welcoming , but pleasant and happy people . If I could rate this hotel a 6, I would ! (Also, perfect location !, close to everything one needs) ","November 10, 2019","58    The Principal Madrid

A special shout-out to Daniel, who couldn’t have been more accommodating.After emailing the hotel about the rooms, we chose to be in the annex, mostly because they promised the rooftop patio to offer spectacular views of the city. However, the only views are the sky above. The walls around the patio are so high that it’s impossible to see through or above them. All you can see is wall.We travelled with friends, and reserved the same category room. We made it clear in booking that we were couples traveling together, While our rooms were neighboring, Our friends received a room which was actually a suite, while we had a room so tiny that we had no place to put our luggage. We pointed this out to the front desk, and they contacted an “acting manager”, who arrived several hours later. She explained that there is one superior room and our friends just happen to get it. So while they had a bedroom with a large bed, hallway, and sitting room and large bathroom, we paid the same to have a tiny room.We requested, in exchange, free breakfast and a room discount, We did receive the breakfasts, but no adjustment was made to our bill. While we were promised an email from the manager regarding this issue, we never received any wordIn addition, the walls of the rooms are so thin, we could hear conversations in nearby rooms.

We didn't use the metro at all because each destination was up to 15 minutes walk.Breakfast was excellent, full of fruits and vegetables and health products.The service of the hotel staff is outstanding, I have been to a lot of hotels in Europe and around the world and nowhere have I encountered a staff so dedicated to helping.

Found it to be an excellent budget hotel, unbeatable insofar as location goes given that it stands bang on the Puerta del Sol, with consequent easy access to practically all the city's main landmarks! In any case, Madrid's efficient Metro system is just a few steps away. We had a top-floor room which had a small private terrace facing a side street. Room space was sufficient if smallish, and bathroom amenities were more than adequate. Hospitality services were good and the web price-included buffet breakfast was plentiful and varied.

At the bullfight he gave us a private lesson throughout the event on all of the intricacies of the bullfight. Absolutely wonderful! We love Santi! He and his staff also made reservations for us at Cafe Gallega, a nice seafood-focused restaurant just a few minutes from the hotel.

There were a few small mishaps and small improvements which could be made, but nothing that would make me not want to go back.

Though the receptionist said there was a great view of the Real Palace from our room, but our room was facing a different direction.The top floor terrace was fab .... again another lovely spot to relax and read and felt miles away from the bustle below.The hotel late at night can be noisy at times due to nearby street traffic, but not as noisy as most other hotels in the city I would guess as it is located on a side street. The location is great for the Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor etc .... whilst the art triangle is a very pleasant 30 min walk away.Service staff were very helpful and friendly in the main restaurant and probably better for breakfast than the red lounge, which isn't as well staffed.Would love to return.","November 4, 2019","61    Gran Melia Palacio de Los Duques - The Leading...

557,"First, book through COSTCO. If you don't, you're crazy. They get you the best rates, and even if you scrape and find the same rate, you have COSTCO standing behind you if there is a problem, and none of these hotels want a problem with COSTCO. Our reservation included a nice ""black car"" transfer from Madrid airport. We arrived early (around noon) and they bought us a cocktail while we waited 30 minutes for our room. The service from the front door folks, front desk, housekeeping and concierge were all top notch. The location is perfect for all the important sites around the Palace and the historic district. Heat and A/C work great, and they had plenty of USB connections to charge phones. The street it faces is very quiet at night, except for the night there was a small riot with tear gas out front. Nothing the Hotel could do, and it was happening all over town. It was a minor demonstration, but the Police take it very seriously. Not kidding about the tear gas. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and the service would remind you of the best hotels state side. We could all the wait staff helpful and friendly. You can't miss with this hotel.

558,"A great choice in the centre of Madrid; easily accessible by public transport and from the airport by Metro. The hotel is within walking distance of all the attractions that central Madrid has to offer.The staff were friendly and helpful and check in was efficient. My room on the 7th floor was adequate for a city stay - typical European size, but spacious enough not to feel crammed. The room was clean and in good condition with complimentary tea/coffee making facilities. The en-suite washroom with a shower had complimentary Avena products as well as large comfortable dressing gowns.Breakfast was served at El Gato Canalla and although not massive had everything you’d need from a breakfast buffet - cheeses, meats, vegetables, juices, breads, cereals and more. Gluten free products are available on the buffet as well as bread rolls on request. If your rate is inclusive of breakfast then in addition to the buffet, you get the choice of a hot meal from the a la carte menu. The evening menu is also very interesting and reservations are recommended especially at the weekend, as we were not able to get a walk in table, even though we arrived early while the restaurant was still empty.The bar by reception is also a nice place to relax and have a drink.During our stay, the Sky Lounge and rooftop pool were closed for renovation. The one thing that I found extremely disappointing about my stay, was the initial contact I had with the hotel prior to arrival. Three days prior to arrival, I e-mailed the hotel advising of my late evening arrival and requesting a room close to friends who were also staying at the hotel at the same time. Without even acknowledging my request, the reservations staff proceeded to pre-charge the payment for the room (I booked a flexible rate), and for some reason were unable to do so. I then received an email informing me of this and advising me that if payment is not sorted within 48 hours they would have to cancel my booking. I found this to be very unwelcoming, and had my friends not been staying at the hotel too, I would have cancelled and booked elsewhere. Having spoken to my bank, I responded that there was no issue with the card they had on file, and requested they try again, which they did with no issues. A day later, they acknowledged my initial request. I feel they could have managed this in a more welcoming manner - if it was important for them to pre-authorise payment that early, given that my rate allowed me to cancel free of charge until the evening before arrival, they could have pointed it out and still acknowledge my request. In a way, I was being told that without a guarantee of payment, they would not consider any requests.All in all, this was a very good stay in Madrid. There is a vast choice of hotels in the city, and I would still consider the Indigo, but I would certainly look at other options before deciding.","December 16, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

559,"The Indigo brand has become my favourite in the IHG group as they are rapidly expanding the number of properties around the world. So when I was given a two day assignment in this area of Madrid it seemed like a good option. I was particularly taken by the line in the hotel's IHG Website PR; ""take a cooling dip in our rooftop infinity pool"" you just might expect to be able to do a few laps in the morning before starting work. Photos of said pool with a sunset background at the ""right angles"" looked far bigger than reality, it had me sold. Even better a few days before arrival I noted as a Spire member I had been upgraded to a suite.On check-in the supervisor apologised that my upgraded room had been sold you know how it is... well not really. But to make up they would give me the other suite for my second night. I explained I had an evening flight when I check out would it be possible to keep my room to just before 3pm (past the usual 2pm extension). He paused then agreed locked in I thought. First morning I headed to the pool which is part of their themed bar, with sunbeds and pool area down some steps for an early swim. No luck! Access via the bar does not open until 10am. So I go back a couple of hours later only to find a lone barman starting to set up. He says he will take me down as the changing room area was still locked. As I enter the area I trip on a raised door frame and the drop to the lower floor inside and fall flat on my face, quick reflexes limit my injury to a bruised hip and arm. In full view of the barman he is concern, and says it is a dangerous step and informs me a woman had broken her arm (or was it a leg) just a few weeks prior same spot... OK so NO SIGNS warning guests in any language or better still a ramp to avoid the drop. I mention it at the front desk to a couple of staff and nobody seems particularly concerned or aware of the woman's injury. As for the pool it is barely more than a plunge pool maybe 15m and is not heated so no more than 16C, so yes you will get ""a cooling dip"" as the sun does not hit the pool until the afternoon!My first room had no view other than the next building with limited natural light, the suite was spacious and comfortable but has no natural light whatsoever. The only highlight of the hotel for me is the sunset at the rooftop bar with some nice light food options to go with your drinks. I have waited until I returned home to write this review as I was too angry after checkout to give a fair appraisal. I landed at reception at 2:45pm to make my way to the airport. An inexperienced young lady on reception processed my account and advised me I had been charged fifteen Euros for my late checkout. I explained to her I had spoken with a supervisor when I arrived and he had approved the extension. She would have none of that and kept insisting on the payment. I asked to see the supervisor then the Duty manager until then she remained insistant. Around twenty years with IHG as a loyal member most in recent years at Spire level. The standard of staff (training) here is hit or mainly miss, especially if you don't speak Spanish. You are paying for the location.","November 23, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

563,Slightly mystified by this hotel’s rating. It’s OK but nothing special. Best bits are location and the excellent breakfast choice (though at €17 it should be good). Be aware that all the standard rooms face onto a very dark internal lightwell. The window also faces the bathroom so if you’re in bed it feels like you’re in a windowless cell! We asked to be moved as our first room on the 5th floor was so claustrophobic. They kindly moved us to the 9th floor which was a bit brighter as closer to the sky but still not great. Make sure you check out the Malasaña neighbourhood a couple of blocks north across Gran Via - lots of cool bars and cafes. ,"October 16, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

564,4 star boutique style hotel. Very modern and very clean. Staff eager to make sure you have all you need and that you’re happy with it. Rooftop bar has lovely view across the rooftops and good view of sunsets. Staff there really friendly. Had a great weekend (4nights) with hotel perfectly positioned in center of Madrid so you can reach any of places of interest easily. The only ‘average’ thing about the hotel was it’s food. Very unimaginative although quite tasty. ,"October 9, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

565,"We were promoted to a nice spacy corner room at higher floor for being an elite member. Stepped into our room, found one bottle of local red wine as a courtesy welcome. Unfortunately, the A/C was not working. We had to ""downgrade"" to another double room. They offered complimentary breakfast for our inconvenience. The upscale breakfast is a surprise beyond our expectation. Super close to subway stations for all attractions. Calle Gran Via is active day and night for tons of activies and eatery. The only down side was the consturction next door at the time we stayed.","September 26, 2019","30    Hotel Indigo Madrid - Gran Via

566,"The only positive thing about this hotel is location and reception staff.Extremely disappointed with the hotel itself, the lifts are painfully slow, they only have 2 and you can wait 10minutes for a lift to arrive.The rooftop pool is poorly designed, most of the sun is blocked by a canapé.It was also closed 2 out of 3 evenings we were staying due to ‘private’ functions. This is Not good.They have a very small bar downstairs in the courtyard.There is also construction work next door.It feels like the hotel has been squeezed in between 2 buildings.This is our first and last stay.

The bathroom offers a rain shower and a large bathtub. We came in December and yet enjoyed the views from the rooftop deck that is worth visiting. Our room rate included the breakfast which was worth it and offered a nice buffet and the option to have eggs made to order. I recommend the Spanish omelette.

571,"My husband and I just spent a weekend at the Gran Melia and it was really lovely. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The room was beautifully done up although the layout of the bathroom was interesting (as if there is a walk in shower making a wetting in which they decided to stick a bathtub). The bed was one of the most comfortable ones I’ve had for a long time, so very welcome after spending hours walking around town. There were a few small mishaps and small improvements which could be made, but nothing that would make me not want to go back. When given some feedback, the staff took it on board and thanked us for letting them know. The breakfast buffet is truly amazing and the breakfast-room staff really friendly.

573,"Really enjoyed our stay in the hotel. There are great public areas to relax in. We had access to the red lounge ...which was lovely to retreat to late afternoon after a day sight seeing.Our bedroom was roomy, with luxurious decor and a lovely outside terrace. Though the receptionist said there was a great view of the Real Palace from our room, but our room was facing a different direction.The top floor terrace was fab .... again another lovely spot to relax and read and felt miles away from the bustle below.The hotel late at night can be noisy at times due to nearby street traffic, but not as noisy as most other hotels in the city I would guess as it is located on a side street. The location is great for the Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor etc .... whilst the art triangle is a very pleasant 30 min walk away.Service staff were very helpful and friendly in the main restaurant and probably better for breakfast than the red lounge, which isn't as well staffed.Would love to return.","November 4, 2019","61    Gran Melia Palacio de Los Duques - The Leading...

575,"First, book through COSTCO. If you don't, you're crazy. They get you the best rates, and even if you scrape and find the same rate, you have COSTCO standing behind you if there is a problem, and none of these hotels want a problem with COSTCO. Our reservation included a nice ""black car"" transfer from Madrid airport. We arrived early (around noon) and they bought us a cocktail while we waited 30 minutes for our room. The service from the front door folks, front desk, housekeeping and concierge were all top notch. The location is perfect for all the important sites around the Palace and the historic district. Heat and A/C work great, and they had plenty of USB connections to charge phones. The street it faces is very quiet at night, except for the night there was a small riot with tear gas out front. Nothing the Hotel could do, and it was happening all over town. It was a minor demonstration, but the Police take it very seriously. Not kidding about the tear gas. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and the service would remind you of the best hotels state side. We could all the wait staff helpful and friendly. You can't miss with this hotel.

The staff is incredibly efficient and genuinely friendly: faultless real hosts The common areas located on the 6th floor are really appealing with comfy sofas and a stunning terrace overlooking the impressive Avenue and a big chunk of Madrid's finest buildings. The room was incredibly big with a huge window with front views of the Metropolis Building, great gigantic bed and modern bathroom with super shower. Lunch at the Atico restaurant by Ramon Freixa is also a great opportunity to get to know to the richest Spanish produce through its diverse dishes.

The room itself was a good size, it had everything we needed (including birthday champagne and chocolates from the hotel), and the breakfast was very very good (mix of buffet and a la carte). The location of the hotel was really great - we could walk everywhere from the hotel, and anywhere that was too far to walk we were very close to the Metro station. The service was excellent and we got an extended check out time. One negative - is we asked the hotel to recommend somewhere for Tapas (we like to eat like locals), and were advised to go to Gran Via to find somewhere (which is full of tourists), and not the kind of recommendation we were expecting. Would not hesitate in recommending this hotel otherwise.","December 12, 2019","58    The Principal Madrid

A few examples are things such as communicating with the photographer, arranging a beautiful and stunning stage on the terrace, greeting us by name at every chance and personal congratulations from all staff after the proposal. I have no complaints in any form and encourage everyone to choose the principal Madrid for a magical experience.

601,"My boyfriend and I spent a few days in Madrid at this hotel. It is certainly incredible, all the facilities are so modern and pretty. Also, it´s just in the city centre so, you can go everywhere by walking. There are so many shops, bars, and restaurants nearby. We wanted to try real Spanish food and because of the huge amount and variety of options, we were so lost that we couldn´t decide where to go. That is why we wanted to especially thank Alex, from the Aura Team that helps us make our choices and gives us really good advice about restaurants and the area in general. Our favourite area was Malasaña which is an alternative and amazing area of Madrid. We will come back for sure to continue discovering the city and of course to the best hotel ever.","December 4, 2019","66    ME BY MELIA MADRID Reina Victoria

603,"This was my second time at a Pestana hotel and oh boy, room sizes keep shrinking. Everything was lovely, except the size of the room, talk about tiny, not enough closet space for two people, no actual bathroom, there’s a toilet in a tiny space, a shower stall and the sink next to the bed, I absolutely hated that, it was awful. Checking in and out was a breeze. Breakfast was excellent, staff was very friendly and attentive and the location was absolutely perfect. If I return to Madrid for 2 or 3 days I would stay at Pestana again, if I stay longer I would look for a bigger room in a different hotel.","December 17, 2019","67    Pestana Plaza Mayor Madrid

605,"This hotel is well located on the Plaza Mayor, walkable to the museums and other sites if you don't mild walking a mile or so. We came in on the train, cab from Puerta de Atocha station was about 8.50. Left by air, cab to the airport was fixed price of 30.00. Lots of shops and things around the plaza, but it seemed to be under construction for a temporary christmas market while we were there.Hospitality was average. When we arrived there was not a doorman on duty, and the desk staff were busy discussing something with each other, so we had to manage the doors with our hands full and all our baggage. Desk staff spoke English and were polite enough. At check-in they offered to have bags taken to our room, gave us a map, told us about the pool and spa. There was a doorman there when we checked out, and they were helpful arranging for a cab to the airport.Room was small but clean, comfortable, quiet. Amenities included robe and slippers, hairdryer, free wi-fi, large flatscreen TV, minibar, nespresso machine. No iron. We were reluctant to use the nespresso machine because the minibar price sheet listed the cost of coffee as 4.50, but we realized later this referred to the bottle of iced coffee in the fridge, and the nespresso was free. We didn't use the laundry service. Biggest problem was the terrible dank smell in the room. I should have paid more attention to this complaint in other reviews. We probably should have asked for another room right away, but I guess we thought it might improve if we opened the window to air it out. Then, once we were settled in, we didn't want to repack all our stuff to move to a new room. Keeping the window open all day helped a little, but we had to put a note on the window asking the maid to keep it open. Not only our room, but some hallways also smelled bad (like a backed-up drain), I think they have a plumbing problem. When I mentioned the smell, they acted all surprised, I can't believe they don't know about it.Hotel amenities include a rooftop terrace (pool closed for the season when we were there), small but lovely indoor pool, sauna, gym (all free to guests), spa services (for a fee, did not book). Spa staff were very friendly and accommodating, gave us a tour. They have a changing area and a few lockers. Indoor pool area was a bit crowded, and another guest took my towel. They have a very nice lounge overlooking the plaza, with fireplaces etc, but we didn't know it was there until the end of our stay. They also have a second entrance right off the square, which would have been convenient except that we could never get the door to work with our keycard. We did not use the restaurant, it seemed expensive, and the menu was a little strange.So it was a nice enough place, a good value for the price. We might have enjoyed it better if we had complained right away about the smelly room, if we knew the coffee was free, if the plaza entrance worked. Wouldn't rule it out to stay again, maybe if they offered us a special deal, but would just as likely try another hotel next time.","November 16, 2019","67    Pestana Plaza Mayor Madrid

We were greeted and provided water as we completed the check in process. The service provided was excellent. Our room was surprisingly spacious. Robes and slippers were provided as well as great toiletries. The room was well kept and very clean. We did not take advantage of the breakfast at the hotel and kind of regretted it. Good breakfast locations were hard to come by and after all was said and done it cost us as much without a decent selection. Something to think about!Hotel location was also great.

Breakfast very good with great range. Customer service very efficient. Cons...Slight issue with some of the foreign channels on the tv which for a deluxe room is disappointing. Could be a internet issue. Slight noise but to be expected.

Room was large, bathroom was very large with huge walk-in shower, deep soaking tub, plush towels, etc. Everything you could ask for! Bed was comfortable with a full menu of pillow options. Breakfast was fantastic with absolutely anything you could imagine wanting from omelettes made to order to platters of hams, smoked salmon, a large variety of yogurts, fresh breads, fruit, cheese, danish, cakes, churros. It goes on and on and everything is available in a bright, contemporary lovely room with large windows.From the concierge to the cleaning staff everyone was accommodating. There's even a gym and lap pool. Sadly the Plaza di Espana is being renovated so we didn't have a view of that, but we did look straight up the Gran Via which was lovely.

622,"We took great care in choosing where to stay in Madrid and, for us, it paid off. The hotel is in a great neighborhood location in the heart of the city. Upon arrival at the ICON Wipton, we received a very warm and friendly welcome from Ester and her staff at Reception. Indeed, throughout our week-long stay she remained the ultimate professional, always friendly, ultra-helpful, willing to go the extra mile, not only with us but also every other guest we witnessed her interact with. Actually each one at the desk was also very kind in helping us organise our tours, calling for taxis and answering our many questions. Our room was spacious enough for our needs and spotlessly clean. There was a wide screen TV, fridge, ample wardrobe space, safe and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was well stocked with good quality toiletries and we had clean towels every day. Our chambermaid always smiled and greeted us every time she saw us. Although breakfast is set out buffet-style, one may also request individual items, such as an omelette. The buffet itself offers a choice of hot and cold options, providing for a good range of preferences. Even though the buffet is self-service, the staff are always on hand and quickly respond to any requests. We thoroughly enjoyed this facility on 3-4 occasions and had great fun meeting other guests and swapping stories over a drink. For other meals, we ate in a couple of nearby restaurants, with The Captain down the road (as recommended by staff) being our clear favorite. Each staff member was always prompt, polite and friendly. We had a wonderful stay at the ICON Wipton hotel which we found to be comfortable, welcoming, clean, well-run and ideally located. What made the difference for us though, was the warmth and kindness of the staff members that we came into contact with, We wouldn’t dream of staying anywhere else on our next visit to Madrid.","November 28, 2019","69    ICON Wipton

The breakfast buffet was beautifully laid out, with cooked options to order.

633,"My first impression of this hotel was that it looks tired and dated. There's a lot of beige and dark wood everywhere. The room was split level which made it quite hazardous. In effect, the bed was at the top of a small flight of stairs, and the polished wooden floor was very slippery. A knee level balustrade made this even more dangerous. I am quite surprised that health and safety rules permit this. I had to move very carefully if I needed to get up in the night and anyone with even minor mobility issues would be in difficulty.There is much, however, that is good about the hotel. The location is excellent. The staff are helpful and friendly. Breakfast is good. It would be churlish to focus only on the negative. I have mixed feelings about the antiquities on display. If they are genuine they are surely of international importance and should be in a museum where they can be curated to the highest standards. ","December 1, 2019","70    Hotel Villa Real

642,"Overall, The Iberostar Las Letras Gran Via was a great hotel. Check-in went smoothly, the room was spacious ( for European standards) and the room was clean. I will say that it is about time for the bathrooms to renovated. The bathroom looked a bit aged. The grout in the shower would benefit greatly from a re-do. I loved the location of this hotel; as it is on the main shopping strip and only a few minutes walk to the main square and tons of restaurants. The hotel does offer breakfast, but that was not something I utilized. I will stay in this hotel again on my next trip to Madrid.","November 6, 2019","71    Iberostar Las Letras Gran Via

646,"Fantastic stay in the heart of Madrid. Walking distance to everything as the hotel is centrally located, and easily accessible. Kudos to Anthony, Anna, Beth, Ursula & Cesar who were attentive and super friendly and helpful. Wanted to check in early after a long red-eye flight, so that I could wash up and maybe catch a quick nap before a full day of sightseeing, Anthony and Anna made it happen. Even though there was an issue with the room assigned, they managed to promptly fix it and offer breakfast while they resolved the issue. I was very impressed with the genuine care and attention they provided as well as the level of service (and always with a warm smile). Thanks for going above and beyond... You made it a great stay!

648,"I spent a lot of time debating where to stay in Madrid and am very glad I picked this location versus something a bit farther west more in the heart of the tourist district. Those popular sites are walkable from this hotel, and a Metro stop is right around the corner, Plus, the hotel is close to the museums and Retiro Park, which was our favorite spot, as well as close to Mallorca, which is an amazing breakfast spot and restaurant. Staff were friendly and answered all our questions. The room was pleasant and clean and had a nice sitting area, as well as a refrigerator. You need your own coffee for the coffee maker, however, but I suggest just going to Mallorca! Beds were very comfortable.","December 3, 2019","72    VP Jardin de Recoletos

652,"Despite a 5-month in advance, confirmed, pre-paid, re-confirmed reservation, my superior room mysteriously ""disappeared"" at 1:36pm on the day of arrival. Apparently, a regular guest called in a favor and was given 3 rooms already promised to other travelers. Over strenuous protests, I was sent to an inferior VP hotel more than 3 km away in a far less desirable location, even though I made it clear that I expected to be accommodated in the same neighborhood as my original booking. I refused the trade, demanded a refund, and sought refuge at Hotel Orfila which welcomed me with open arms. VP Jardin de Recoletos cannot be trusted with your money or with your careful travel plans.

653,"We stayed five nights at the comfortable and stylish VP Jardin de Recoletos and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Modern stylish decor, in a quiet street, close to some superb shops and restaurants in the upmarket Recoleto/Salamanca area, large room with roomy balcony, comfortable beds, very friendly and helpful staff. We could walk to most sites, and there were a number of Metro stations just 5-10 mins away. Travelling by Metro was fun, cheap and very efficient. We chose the hotel because it listed a kitchenette in each room as a benefit. We thought maybe we would be able to make our own quick breakfast and enjoy it on the balcony before a heady day of sight-seeing. As it turned out the kitchenette was not very well stocked with utensils, we were surprised to find there was no coffee maker, not even a kettle in the room to make morning coffee and tea (there was a microwave oven). There were no tea/coffee supplies either, no washing up liquid, no supplies of any kind other than soft drink. So if you're looking for effective kitchenette facilities look somewhere else. But if not, then this is a great place to stay.","May 23, 2019","72    VP Jardin de Recoletos

654,"Very nice & comfortable hotel within easy walking distance of the places you’d want to see & visit. Maybe a maximum 30 minute walk to the farthest place. Roughly 20 minutes from the airport for a fixed 30 Euro fee (taxis will take 4 people with hand luggage).Good efficient & friendly staff with good English. Nice rooms (usually twin beds – smaller than doubles but bigger than singles), decent bathrooms with good showers. Lift & stairs (just 3 floors anyway). Small enclosed rear garden area with seating & tables to eat. Quiet side street location and close to a number of places to eat & drink.Breakfast offers a very good cold selection with hot (usually eggs, omlettes etc) options made to order. Evening dinner offers good choices and good dishes, Oxtail dishes recommended. No food complaints at all. Very nice. A good but small selection of decent beers (Spanish, German Belgian) and wines.

662,"I booked this Hotel online for a long weekend. It was not my first choice and was less expensive than I was prepared to pay. I had some reservations, as I was concerned from some of the pictures I saw online that it may be a little faded in its appearance, but I need not have worried. I arrived three hours before check-in hoping they would be happy to hold my luggage while I went in search of lunch. The staff at reception were most welcoming and spoke perfect English. Without me asking, they checked my reservation and found my room was ready. The room itself exceeded all my expectations. It was vast, clean, very well appointed and had a huge bathroom. The bathroom is worth a special mention, because the shower is without doubt THE finest shower I have ever experienced in any hotel anywhere in the world. The bathroom was palatial, with bidet and two sinks, a massive shower and an equally sized bath. The bedroom was similarly well appointed, the bed and bed linen perfect, there was an ironing board and iron, a safe, a minibar, all the usual things you find in a hotel room, but everything was of excellent quality. I have stayed in many hotels all over the world, over the last forty years but this ranks as good as the very best. I would not consider staying anywhere else in Madrid on my next visit.

680,"There's so much meat in Spain, that it's worth noting that this hotel had enough on the breakfast menu to fill up a vegan--juices, nuts, fruits, breads. We did not see that in other hotels in Spain. The hotel entrance is on a pedestrian pathway near the Puerta Del Sol--a huge public square. For this reason, taxis can't come to the front door. They can park and wait less than a block away, but it's worth noting if you have heavy bags or elderly walkers. We could not tell if the hotel was accessible; our triple room was not. Otherwise, it was a clean and quiet affordable hotel in a very busy area. English speaking staff.","September 27, 2019","75    Petit Palace Puerta Del Sol

705,"I stayed three nights recently on a business trip to Madrid. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to/from Madrid Barajas Airport, running during the day every 30 minutes with service to all terminals. I don’t know what the after-hours bus schedule is.Hotel rooms are clean and comfortable, mine had a glass door that allowed me to let in fresh air from outside. My king bed was very comfortable with 4 pillows. The room floor was hardwood, which I liked very much. To me, carpeting never seems as clean as wooden or tiled floors. Bathroom had a tub, separate shower, toilet, bidet, large glass sink and ample mirrors. Food here is very expensive. I ordered fish and chips for lunch on day one, 22 euros before I added a coke. I ordered a “Burger Party” cheeseburger on day three for dinner, 24 euros (for a hamburger and fries!!!!) before I added a coke. I ordered a pizza from room service later that same night, the total, including a coke and “tray fee” came to 30 euros. There aren’t many (any?) restaurants nearby so be warned .. you may need to Uber to eat, or just be ready to shell out a lot of cash.My waters (2 free per day) were never replaced.. day one I had two waters however on the next two days I was never given more. My coworker had the same experience so this is not isolated. I only received one bar of soap which I needed to shuttle back and forth from the shower to the sink.Executive lounge had extremely limited food choices during the 1800-2100 hours of operation that included alcohol. However, there was an ample supply of Spanish bottled beer and other spirits.All in all, I would return here. The positives far outweighed the few negatives I mentioned.

708,"Whilst by no means the best airport hotel I've stayed at, the Hilton Madrid Airport is certainly adequate for an overnight stay. As you would expect from a Hilton property, it is clean and has all the facilities you need as a business or leisure traveller.However, I do have a few comments. Firstly, the hotel is some distance from some of the airport terminals (particulalry Terminal 4), so you will need to use the hotel shuttle (available every 30 minutes) to transit to and from the hotel. This is not in itself a huge issue, it's just something you need to make provision for in your timing.Secondly, the airconditioning in the room didn't seem to be particularly efficient and it resulted in a fairly stuffy night's sleep.Thirdly, the Executive Lounge is at best, basic particulalry compared to many others I've used over the years. Both the drink and food choices are limited and the room itself doesn't have great ambience.Finally, the property is located in a light industrial area, so it's not possible to walk out and grab a meal at a nearby restaurant. As a result, you're virtually obliged to use the hotel's restaurant which is of adequate quality, but is a very high price compared to most restaurants in Spain of a similar standard.As a thoughtfull touch, the hotel provides complementary coffee, juice and pastries in the lobby for guests leaving in the early morning prior to the availability of a full breakfast.In summary, the Hilton Madrid Airport served its purpose as somewhere clean and quiet to stay overnight between flights. However, compared to similar standard airport hotels around the world, I wouldn't say it's the best of the breed.","November 29, 2019","78    Hilton Madrid Airport

The room and bathroom are cleaned magnificently, everyday.The kitchen facilities are excellent, plenty of cups, utensils, plates, a microwave and a fridge where you can stash your stuff. Plastic bags are provided for keeping food together and a pen to write your name on the bag. The kitchen, lounge and the entire hotel is kept fantastically clean. The cleaning staff are almost OCD about it, but kudos for that.Location wise, the hostel is only 2 minutes walk to the nearest metro station which is Sol. The hostel is practically on several of the major shopping thoroughfares in central Madrid, so eating, drinking and shopping will be no problem at all. There's also a El Cortes Ingles with a supermarket about two minutes walk if you prefer to stock up and eat at the hostel.Finally, I'd say the staff are a fantastic bunch. Friendly and helpful with any queries and requests.","July 21, 2019","80    Toc Hostel & Suites

The common rooms were inviting and the kitchen (with fridge, micro and oven for the guests to use) was well run and clean.Madrid is a very walkable city and so in under twenty minutes you have the big art museums, El Retiro park, and in ten minutes there are lots and lots of cool and cosy bars and cafes and independent stores in Malasaña. The royal palace and Gran Via is just a five minute walk away.Only negative thing was that me and my husbands mattresses were worn out, so it felt a bit like sleeping a hammock. (Not great for the back). Still I would not hesitate to return to this hostel, since everything else was comfortable, easy and inviting.","July 7, 2019","80    Toc Hostel & Suites

Comfortable beds and clean facilities. The staff was nice and helpful. Breakfast was paid, but I decided to have it one morning to taste it and I don't regret it! Everything was fresh, of good quality and the choice was even a bit larger than in average hostels. In the end, you spend a little more money but what you get is definitely worth the price!

726,Less than 12 hours after booking my flights and this Hostel I found out that my whole reason for being in Madrid on the 1st June 2019 was a Scam. I was scammed out of nearly £1800. I explained this to the TOC Hostel and they would not consider returning my money after I asked to cancel. I have lost all of my savings to this Scam and now this Hostel and the Airline that I booked with are compounding that hurt even more.Do Hotels/Hostels flights etc have a cooling off period where you can cancel within a certain timeframe without losing everything??,"May 9, 2019","80    Toc Hostel & Suites

The reception staff were really helpful, and they printed off some stuff for me at no charge - it is the little stuff like this that makes an impression. The room and hotel were really clean, well appointed, serviced each day, fresh clean towels and amenities provided. It had a lovely balcony, was totally sound proof (when I opened the windows there was a total party happening every night, but I couldnt hear it with the windows closed), and a lovely queen sized bed, chair to sit in and best of all, fingerprint entry to your room - so no key to carry or lose.It was buzzing with people, I felt safe walking to the hostel at night by myself, the kitchen was clean and well appointed (though no stove for cooking, just an oven, microwave). The decor was fun and inviting, there was a lovely social area with a bar, billiard table and plenty of seating for everyone in comfortable couches or tables and chairs.

730,"This is a nice hotel. Beds are comfortable. The recent updates to the hotel do make it feel modern. We had a room with a window to the rear courtyard. No street noises which was nice. Great views from the rooftop patio! The location is central with great shopping, sites, and city tour bus nearby. I am being critical of the hotel for three items. The public-access computer on the main floor is in a meeting room which the often rent out to groups. So if there is a meeting you cannot use the computer. Also the chair(s) in this room are not at the correct height (more like armchairs than a desk chair). The biggest issue is their idea of a non-smoking hotel. Granted guests cannot smoke in the building, BUT they have a covered area at the main entrance with an ash tray. People smoke right in front of the main door! This air gets immediately sucked into the hotel and pulled up the central stairwell because the door to the roof-top patio is kept open. On more than one night I had to wet a towel and place it at the bottom of my door to try and stop the smell from getting into my room! When I contacted the front desk they came to see what I was talking about. The man said he could not smell anything in the hallway, but that's impossible. He sent up housekeeping to spray deodorizer. This is not a solution to the problem and they declined my idea to change where they allow guests to smoke. I would not suggest staying at this hotel unless you do not mind the smell of second-hand smoke in the building and potentially in your room.","December 1, 2019","81    H10 Puerta de Alcala

The rooms are spacious, with very nice modern furniture and art, a wonderfully comfortable bed and an also spacious bathroom with every accessory that you can imagine. No need to call reception for the missing toothbrush or shaving foam...everything is there already. Big TV with international channels, wifi, etc... The building is also decorated with top class taste. Art, design lights, chairs, sofas,... You can tell that there is thought and care in every single little thing. The breakfast buffet is not a disappointment either. Wide variety of options and all of high quality. If all this was not enough, the best in my opinion is the client experience and service. The staff are outstanding in their profession. Perfect balance between attention and respect for the costumer's space. When working you appreciate being offered attention, but you also require not being disturben unnecessarily. And they have found the formula to achieve both. Reception was also welcoming, fast, efficient and informative. I was working, but there were families and tourists staying as well. Never getting too busy, though. And the price is very competitive for their range. This is not a budget hotel, but it is very much worth the price that they charge.

We waited 20 minutes to get served, there were people coming in after us and being seated right beside us and getting served before us so my boyfriend went to the bar to order our drinks, the woman behind the bar said sit down someone will take you order, in a very rude way! He came to sit down and we waited Another 5 minutes to order. We would have left but it was our last night in Madrid and we hadn’t be able to go to this bar yet as we were staying in the hotel ourselves but every time we had went it was far too busy and was nowhere for us to sit.

738,"Every aspect of my stay was a step above and beyond what was necessary. I truly was sad to check out! Fabulous hotel located in the heart of central Madrid on the very popular Calle Gran Via. Front reception staff was actually friendly (hard to find in Madrid) who helped me get checked in.The lady also gave me a helpful map and pointed out where the 2 museums were that I wanted to visit. I arrived a bit early but it wasn’t a problem at all and I was able to have access to my room right away. My room was practical yet stylish. I loved the floor to ceiling mirror that also doubled as the bathroom door. As is common in Europe, the room card must be placed in the slot by the door for the electricity to work. In the bathroom, there was a narrow counter above the sink to place toiletries. There was a magnifying mirror next to the sink which was very much appreciated. The 1/2 glass shower door meant that the bath water did not spill out onto the floor. The drain worked well. There was a placard with instructions to work the shower however it made no sense at all and unfortunately was not helpful at all. The shower seemed to have one temperature, which was hotter than I cared for, a rarity in Europe where most often the problem seems to be the inability to get hot water. I appreciated the amenities that were provided, shower gel, shampoo, LOTION(!), a shower camp and a sponge. The shower drained well. Electrical outlets on both side of the bed were very convenient. The only possible drawback was that my room faced Calle Gran Via and was pretty noisy. I slept fine but others might find it a problem.

Instead of a buffet or a buffet combined with hot order, you simply order what you wanted from the expansive menu (everything from an Iberian ham platter to a cheese tray to yogurt and muesli to eggs, waffles, etc.) - the food was uniformly delicious and the wait staff (shout out to Alejandro) was so friendly. They even had soy milk for my dairy-sensitive daughter. We could not have been happier. In the rooms, the beds were very comfortable (they provided a third bed for my daughter instead of the pull-out couch that is customary in Europe triples and less comfortable) and it was behind a partial wall for some privacy. The bathroom was very spacious (especially by European standards) with double sinks, a towel warmer, and a tub shower with consistently good pressure and temperature control. The mini bar items were reasonably priced, there were ample outlets for our devices, and there were individual adjustable lamps beside the double bed. Extra touches: they left a typewritten multi-page list of the neighborhoods in Madrid and the activities, sites, favorite staff restaurants in each one. There is a gorgeous rooftop bar; however, it was too cold to enjoy that during our visit.

We experienced loud outbursts past midnight from people walking through. 2. Location is ideal for walking to all the attractions.3. Uber from the train station was 8 Euros and change.4. Taxi from the hotel to the airport was a flat rate of 30 Euros.Total score = 4.5 (would definitely return)","November 30, 2019","84    The Walt Madrid

The only issue I did have was disappointing...I reported to the front desk manager that our AC unit was dripping on the floor the very first evening and I was told that the setting was possibly to low and it was creating condensation. We adjusted setting on AC to a setting that was almost at room temperature and the drip continued through the night and morning. It was difficult to sleep due to the lack of AC and constant drip sound. I explained this to the manager upon check out and all we got was and I am sorry. It was disappointing because the hotel should do a better job at customer service. we will not be back again because of this.

773,"We stayed here for 3 nights. One night prior to our tour beginning and 2 nights on the tour. The first night we had a triple room which was really a double room with the addition of a third bed. This configuration was tight and since there is no where in the bathroom to store anything, the room was claustrophobic with all the suitcases, toiletry bags, and beds. On days 2 and 3 the third person moved into their own room and our room felt much more comfortable and big enough for 2. The room is fine but the bathroom lacks adequate counter space. There is a great deal of open and empty space in the bathroom due to the spartan design of the room so adding some type of shelving to address lack of storage would be an easy fix.We purchased the buffet breakfast the first day and it was included on the tour day mornings. This was worth the price. The food was good and there was a great deal of variety including gluten free options. The restaurant was clean and the food was replenished frequently. We didn't see any other places to eat breakfast near the hotel so the buffet is a great option. The location is not walkable to the main area of Madrid but a bus stop is located just down the street and the bus goes to the middle of town. There is also a metro stop nearby so transportation is easy accessible to anywhere you want to visit in Madrid.","September 11, 2019","85    Ayre Gran Hotel Colon

775,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at Hostal Gala with my daughter. Have to say I was a bit apprehensive to stay in a hostel as it always brings to mind dormitories and backpackers. How wrong I was. A bit hard to find as just a wooden front door with a tatty small flag above it. However once at reception the welcome was warm and friendly.The room we had was spotlessly clean, spacious with a great ensuite, and a small balcony overlooking the square. The beds were clean and comfy. The location is perfect as within walking distance of pretty much everything, Gran Via, Plaza del Mayor, Plaza del Sol, the Palace and Cathedral and the food market. Lots of bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity and even though there are hot & cold beverage vending machines in the hostel, there is a great cafe opposite. The reception is manned 24/7 but you get your own door keys so can come and go freely. The only downside is if your a light sleeper you may need ear plugs. The square outside attracts skateboarders until quite late, the hostel is above an Escape Room venue which obviously has some excitable moments, the internal walls are a bit thin and the floor in our room was very squeaky but then it is an old building. Overall great value for money for a great location, good size clean room with a comfy bed. ","May 4, 2019","86    Hostal Gala

Probably one of the nicest hotel/hostel staffs I've come across.The main problem:Thursday and Friday night the street turns into a party area. The next morning there are beer cans and broken bottles all over the place. When we left to go to the airport there were still a group of guys outside that were drinking and tried to harass us as we walked away. This is obviously not a negative on the hostel Gala, but it's something you should be aware of if choosing it.Bring ear plugs or noise cancellation technology if needed. My wife is not normally sensitive to noise and she couldn't sleep.The renovations that were done look nice in the pictures but everything is very cheaply done. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. pulling the sheets bad the mattress looked about 20+ years old. The room was tiny, really tiny. The bathroom was equally small. The bed was full size, not queen.

788,"This hotel is located in Madrid's financial district, meaning it's a bit out of the way from the central tourism area. However, it's a two-minute walk to Cuatro Caminos metro station, which has connections to several different metro lines (including the one to the airport!), meaning you can hop on and get around the city with ease. It took about 20 minutes to get to Sol station, which is by Plaza Mayor, to give you an example. That said, there is enough by the hotel to keep you entertained and well-fed; there's many fast-food places, bars, shops, and even a grocery store (Carrefour, open 24/7). The grocery store came in very handy, especially since we had a mini-fridge in our room.The hotel workers did their best to check us in as quickly as possible - especially since we arrived at 9am and they didn't anticipate any clean rooms to be available. The room itself was pretty spacious and super clean. My travel partner - who is particularly picky about cleanliness - was impressed, so that's saying something! The beds were incredibly comfortable and I had no issues sleeping. The A/C worked AMAZING, which was much needed, given the heat in Madrid in July. I experienced two minor issues I'd like to share. For one, the wifi wasn't the best. When you're on a trip, you shouldn't be glued to your phone - you should be off enjoying the sights! However, it's nice to be able to get in touch with people back home or take some downtime to watch YouTube, and that's hard to do when the wifi is finicky. The second issue I had was the hair dryer going off on its own at 5 or 6ish in the morning during two nights of our stay. It was very weird. All of a sudden, the hair dryer turned on by itself, woke us up, and we had to go and shut it off. It was the only piece of equipment in our room that seemed outdated, so I'm not sure if that's the cause for it malfunctioning or what? Overall, this place is aesthetically beautiful and modern, very comfortable, and close to amenities. Would recommend.","July 15, 2019","87    VP Jardin Metropolitano

Luckily for us the pool was still open (until 11.30pm each night) so we were able to enjoy the heated pool by moonlight! The rooms were quirky in design, spotlessly clean and the breakfast (which was included) was delicious and open until 1100am so plenty of opportunity for a lie-in.

They make you feel special and always call you by your name.We stayed 4 nights and we wanted even to stay longer... At the beginning of my stay I had some difficulties (who doesn't? We are human and nothing is perfect) but the employees of the hotel resolved everything promptly and we were treated like royalty.The hospitality and restaurants industry is full of certain difficulties when taking care of its guests... No one is exempt! The secret is to react promptly and resolve anything that will be on the way... This is exactly what this hotel did and I want to give special thanks to David from the Front Desk who was so helpful and he was always ready to have a nice conversation with us and to take care of any of our needs.The room was huge (203) in incredible amenities. The hotel premises are always spotless and you always find a friendly and helpful team member around.Even though the location is very central and convenient the hotel is very quite and it's perfect for a good sleep and to recharge during your holidays.I will tell all my family and friends about this hotel and I can't wait to be back... And again... David! Thank you so much and to all your Team... You have made our stay memorable.","November 21, 2019","89    Axel Hotel Madrid

The manager personally made sure our stay was perfect including finding two rooms side by side on a busy long weekend last minute for us. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooftop pool can’t be beat. Highly recommend having the breakfast, it’s fantastic. We loved the decor of the rooms and learning about its connection to queer culture in Spain. Cortes is a wonderful area to wonder around in day and night, plus we could walk to all the big museums.

799,We booked the hotel through Easyjet and sooooo glad that we did. As it says on the advertisement is is heterofriendly and we just loved everything about it. the staff on reception were fantastic and the room was stunning! Such a fun decor and so many lovely little touches in the presentation of the room. The beds were super comfortable and couldn't fault anything about our stay. Breakfast buffet is available in the adjoining eating area and we added that on to our accommodation booking as it was there was ample choice. The hotel is very near to the centre of the city and why we originally chose it.

The super spacious Hot Water Rain Shower in the room was best part(much needed after a hectic day)Apart from daily cleaning and Towel change, the Lobby of the Hostel is very trendy, super vibrant and lovely place to sit in. Having the key as an Bar-code is also super helpful, which eliminates the burden of carrying the Plastic Key Card everywhere. The Staff is also very helpful. Experience is much superior to the generic crowded hostel. Everything feels really exclusive. Tribunal Metro is right outside the Hostel..20 meters. Tribunal is also is on the Direct Line from Atocha Madrid Station, from where Renfe Trains can taken to various nearby cities Barcelona/Valencia/ Toledo etc, which makes travel very convenient. If you are arriving/traveling via train in Madrid...forget everything and take the Metro.

807,"Dear Bastardo Hostel,I am ambivalent with my evaluation!The really intelligent furnishing of the 6-bed rooms allows a maximum degree of privacy for a multi-bed room. This has been a great success and I have never experienced it like this in a hostel before! The sanitary facilities in the rooms are very clean, and there is even a rain shower. In addition to the shampoo provided in the showers, soaps on the washbasins would be desirable. If one does not intend to provide for oneself during one's stay, I would recommend the hostel to 100%. There are many leisure activities, such as yoga classes, and the bar and restaurant are lovingly run.However, I think it's a pity that, besides the generous design in the ""commercial"" areas, the kitchen for the guests is very neglected. It is located in the basement, which means: no windows! And there is no stove. Even if its existence is not officially claimed on the website, at least my definition of a kitchen includes a stove, and two microwaves are not enough. I therefore think that the description on the website is misleading. The ambience of the ""Kitchenette"" doesn't invite you to stay and have a cosy meal! The black wall paint and neon tubes make you feel more like being in an interrogation room. Since at the time of my stay on the beautiful roof terrace there was no restaurant service, one could sit down there on the floor for a snack, which was very nice. But without this possibility, as a self-caterer, one has few possibilities.As I said, I am ambivalent. On the one hand, the hostel is suitable for both long and short stays, young and old people, picky and less picky guests due to the good furnishings and equipment. Only if you like to cook fresh yourself, you have to live with deductions.But all in all: a joyful stay!","September 8, 2019","90    Bastardo Hostel

Prince, Almudena, Giulia and David welcomed us, gave us advice and said goodbye as if we were close for life. The reception in the hands of Isabel, Anabel and Sara was an absolute attention to any detail that we might need to have a more comfortable stay. The room service is impeccable, detailed and tidy. In the Lobo 8 restaurant we were lucky enough to be recommended by Chef Angelo and pastry chef Sergio, who would define the gastronomic concept as modern, personal, high quality and careful with the product. The restaurant service was very professional for the detailed description of each of the elaborations that served us as well as the concern for food intolerances. Alejandro, Raul, María and Marta serve you at breakfast and in the restaurant as pure lovers of their trade, they transmit their love for what they do. Lobbyto Cocktail Bar is the space of the lobby of the hotel converted into a spectacular cocktail of the 20s United States at a price more than fair for the quality of the signature cocktails of the hand of Mike and Fabri.Finally I prefer that you experience on your own the comfort, quality and luxury of the rooms and each of the details that are throughout the hotel.

The hotel is centrally located and in walking distance from a lot of hot spots.What makes it stand out is the staff who provided lots of nice personal touchea and made us feel special.For example, we received a handwritten welcome note in our room and later another note offering a spa discount.When I was disappointed by the shumai in the lobby restaurant, not only were the waiters apologetic and took the food off the bill, they later delivered chocolate cake to our room. It was a nice touch.When we told the manager how fabulous one of the concierge staff was (she got the Netflix adapter working and helped us watch TV in English), they later sent up two bottles of Coke Light, our beverage of choice with two glasses of ice.

The sound proofing of the room is terribly bad. Our room is located just next to the house keeping store room and every morning , you will be awakened by the noise created when they start work.

823,"As a traveler who stayed in hotels around the 4 to 5-star neighborhood, I must say I was very impressed with the service of this franchise. Most (not all, unfortunately) of the staff were extremely welcoming and nice. A lot of thanks to Carolina for making it feel like home, It didn’t feel like the over courteous 4-5 Star Service, rather it felt like the staff were our friends, genuinely trying to help us out. The location is great sandwiched between Gran Via and Puerto Del Sol (both very happening places). You could walk there and spend the day in those areas or grab a hop on hop off bus from either area.I was traveling with my sister and we initially booked a room at Petit Palace Del Carmen. The standard room was too small for the both us (this is purely personal preference, the room came with two beds like stated, however, it was a little tight for our liking). We asked for a second standard room but they were fully booked. Fortunately, there was another Petit Palace hotel right next door i.e. Tres Crusces (I know, talk about convenience). Noelia from Del Carmen along with Carolina from Tres Crusces were kind enough to transfer our current room booking to Petit Palace Tres Cruces. This was done with no hassle whatsoever and we got the second vacant room in Tres Cruces. We got two attic rooms at the Tres Crusces. That coupled with the heatwave going on in Europe at the time made the room unbearable. There was only one vacant non-attic room which we took and the next night the second non-attic room became available and Carolina was kind enough to do all the room transfers again.Some downs, the rooms were a little underkept, the A/C Control in my room had a knob missing (it was functional nonetheless), however for a small boutique budget hotel, there should be some scope of tolerance. The big downside for me though was Roberto in the front desk. As a paying customer, I have never been to a hotel where the staff shrugs at my requests. When my sister asked him to relocate my room the first night, he shrugged and said, ""Well, we are fully booked, I don't know what you want me to do"". When I asked whether the hotel gives complimentary water he shrugged and said: ""Well, if you want water, you have to buy it"". Yes, hotel policies might be in place, but when you shrug and phrase your sentences in such a negative way, it makes the paying guest feel very frustrated. Granted, after a bit of nagging, he did help me out by giving me a fan in the attic room on my first night. I expected a little better service, even for a budget hotel.As far as budget hotels go, this is a really great option with mostly great staff. If you’re into the 4-5 Star hotel experience, this is not the hotel for you.","July 5, 2019","92    Petit Palace Tres Cruces

831,"Lovely experience.Rooms small but otherwise good.Reception and bar staff really very very good.Sadly breakfast staff not likewise and the modest breakfast very average.The plates are cold and the 'Hot' food too need microwaving.Found generally in Madrid that cold plates are the norm for hot food.However ,hotel ideal for a city break with taxis outside always available.Beds good.","November 7, 2019","93    Hotel Puerta de Toledo

833,Close to metro station and stumbling distance to local cafes where you can get basic food and cheap drinks. Comfortable and spacious accomodation which has a bar ( can obtain snacks). The buffet breakfast is very good - plenty of choise of cold and hot food. We were on 3rd floor which was quiet and had all basic needs covered.,"October 15, 2019","93    Hotel Puerta de Toledo

834,"We stayed for 1 night, the room was big enough to open-up 2 medium size luggage and the bed was comfy. My only concern was the shower, I think this is very common in Spain that they don't have drapes in the shower so when you take shower the water goes out and the whole floor gets wet but other than that no complains.","October 13, 2019","93    Hotel Puerta de Toledo

835,"I recently spent a week here and found the hotel to be comfortable and the staff excellent.As a solo traveler, I ended up in a tiny tiny room, but you don't go to Madrid to stay in your hotel room. The room was comfortable to sleep in and the included internet allowed me to plan out my adventures.As I arrived early, I wasn't able to check in right away and there were facilities for safe and secure storage of my baggage. Staff was also unsurprised and helpful when I couldn't figure out how to turn on the lights in the room. It seems that my room key needed to be put in to a device just inside the room to turn on the power. Clever, but unexpected. I've not encountered that before.The front desk staff was also helpful in working with my tour provider passing on vouchers and advising me of any messages. As a non-Spanish speaker I was pleased that there was always someone there who was fluent in English.The bed was comfortable and even though I had an inner room it faced on to a central courtyard and there was good natural light. I did find the small shower stall floor a bit slippery but it was small so there was no real danger of injury.If you don't want to use the hotel lounge there are cafes close by. The included breakfast in the lower floor was quite varied and allowed me to easily fuel up for a day of exploring.There is a subway stop just a block away so if you aren't up to walking the hilly streets of Madrid to get to where you want, you can easily get everywhere by transit.From my base here, I was able to go visit the Prado and Royal Palace, both within an hour's walk for me - but I'm an active pedestrian. I enjoyed just also wandering around the various neighbourhoods.","September 23, 2019","93    Hotel Puerta de Toledo

836,"The Hotel Puerta de Toledo is situated at the edge of the busy and potentially noisy areas of Madrid but is only a twenty minute walk to the exciting and vibrant Plaza de Mayor which is as close to the centre of Madrid as you can get. The hotel itself is listed as a three star but in my opinion it is closer to at least a three and a half star.From the moment you walk into the hotel you notice a lively but ordered atmosphere in clean and modern surroundings, reception and check in are well organised and the rooms are extremely well furnished and very clean, plus our room was larger than I normally expect from a three star hotel. If you do not want to walk to your chosen sights in Madrid then about two hundred meters from the hotel is a metro station which not only allows easy, quick and cheap transport around Madrid but also can take you to and from Madrid airport.In addition to walking and the metro there is also an excellent public bus network with stops within fifty meters of the hotel. I would recommend buying a Madrid transport card which can be used on most methods of public transport and you choose what value to put onto the card and you can add additional monies as and when required, this card makes travelling much easier and I believe that it also works out cheaper. After the first busy and exhausting day sightseeing we returned to the hotel and had a great nights sleep in a very comfortable bed and a silent room, the double glazing was excellent along with the lack of noise from other rooms and corridors. After rising and showering we made our way down to the breakfast area to be greeted with the biggest selection of differing and tasty foods that I have ever been presented with for breakfast. Allow yourself to enjoy as many dishes as possible, self service, before setting out again to see the sights of Madrid. We allowed ourselves a five night break to take in Madrid but will need to return as there is so much to see, when we do return we intend to stay at the Hotel Puerta de Toledo again,","August 9, 2019","93    Hotel Puerta de Toledo
